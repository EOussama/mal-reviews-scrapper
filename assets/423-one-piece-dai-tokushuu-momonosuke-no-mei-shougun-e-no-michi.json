    "content": "\n                And end of an era. It feels so wrong to see Wano finally ending, after almost 5 years of serialization, there are people who went from highschool to college graduations during that time, the world has changed massively that it feels so weird to chart the passage of time by Anime release schedules.\n\r\nIn recap episode, the 11-th Wano recap, we pay goodbye to Wano and its resident through the lense of Momonosuke, the once annoying child crybaby to the manly, still, annoying crybaby as he parts ways with the straw hats. Showing scenes of him gathering courage to unit Wano after Kaido and Orochi\u2019s fall,to defending Wano from Greenbull\u2019s infiltrating.\n\r\nAt least for me, the content of the recap wasn\u2019t interesting or engaging enough for me to care too much for it, it feels like we\u2019ve gotten dozen recaps of similar mediocre quality over the run.\n"
