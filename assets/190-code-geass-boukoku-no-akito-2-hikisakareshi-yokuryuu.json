    "content": "\n                What an episode this was, objectively better, but also downgraded in some respects.\r\nThis episode expands more about Akito and his relationship with his new comrades, it spikes interests to see how it all concludes, will he switch sides? Because that\u2019s the feeling I get from him.\r\nThe character that appeared accompanying resembles Lelouch so much that it could actually be him, so much resemblance that I can\u2019t ignore it, maybe it\u2019s somebody else, but the fact he got an eye patch on the same eye Lelouch had his Geass is also bugging me.\r\nI\u2019m loving the Suzaku and Lelouch cameos, I hope for a Suzaku vs. Akitoand his crew fight, it would be such a bomber to pass on.\r\nAkito\u2019s Geass or whatever his neuro-related power is very intriguing that it does not have the traditional Geass pattern, maybe it is but an effect from his Brother\u2019s Geass? I don\u2019t know.\r\nThis episode/movie was better than the last one in terms of hype and action, however, I felt like the visuals have gotten a significant downgrade. The movement is kind of clunky, the CGI is very exposed and sometimes out of place and jugged and the colors don\u2019t tend to match the lightning on the backgrounds.\n"
