    "content": "\n                Man, do all of these sick psychic fiction draw me in, you say more of Mob, I say hell yeah, before we start, at the end of the special, there was a moment that I looked for in a long time, in which they announce the second season of the anime coming up soon, and man, that was such a great way to do it.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nFascinating, this is in some form a summary of the original series, but it has a unique touch of itself too, how you say? well, our main cast, Reigen, and Mob are writing a book, in order to gettons of sells and gain money of course (That's so Reigen), they went ahead and rephrase the events of the story to make it as if Reigen was the one with the extraordinary psychic powers, so they basically retold the story in an hour span, but with the focus on Reigen and him being the lone protagonist, it was all centered around the humour more than anything else, and it was hilarious.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nI always love Mob Psycho 100's art style, looking very retro, the animation is just as delicious to the eye as your favorite candy as it melts in your mouth, the abstract backgrounds, and everything syncs very well, just like in the main show, you can't move your head away from the screen on the big animation moments, the fights and everything, It was just great to relive the action once again.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nI've always wondered at how amazing the soundtrack is, I like how fast-paced it is, it suits the action on the screen very well, and the voice acting is just so on point, I'm always glad they had the classic Mob Psycho 100 opening on this one, got a fair reminder of how awesome it was.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nOh man, if anything this series got right is the verity of characters, all are great and likable, I couldn't complain about anything a character does, always keeping you on your toes with their decision and humor, Dimple, Reigen, and Hanazawa are just the best man.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nI didn't enjoy this as much as I expected I would, mainly because it was a 90% recap of what happened, so knowing what would happen all the time removed that layer of suspense to the experience, the humour, on the other hand, was just great, had a great sum of giggles along the way.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nFor a recap, this was amazing, I thought an hour long of content was going to be boring, but surprisingly enough, I never had to check the time constantly being for this ordeal to end, I had a great watch, and would definitely recommend watching this before the second season airs to sort of catch up rather than going ahead and rewatching the whole first season.\n"
