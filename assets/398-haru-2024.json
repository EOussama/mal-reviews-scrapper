    "content": "\n                Anime is great in the sense that more often than not, being a fan of throws you at a interconnected tangle of hundreds if not thousands of connected works of different types. One of which is music, and great music at that.\n\r\nFrieren has us spoiled in this regard, not only has it graced us with a classic YOASOBI hit, but also an n-buna masterpiece.\n\r\nThe song albeit trippy, felt like a weird fever dream that is very familiar and very strange all at the same time. The vocals feel like pleading for one\u2019s innocence while the visual style of blending 2D and 3D did contribute themost for the trippy feel.\n\r\nCertainly, the visuals, being 3D, were the furthest from being considered good or \u201cappetizing\u201d to look at, but I felt as thought the reason for that was more intentional than not because it really does sell the nostalgic aspect for a distant memory that\u2019s growing rusting and faint by the day. The one that will creep you up as a fever dream and wake you up with a warm tear on you cheek and a muddy mood for the rest of the day.\n\r\nIt\u2019s an acquired taste.\n"
