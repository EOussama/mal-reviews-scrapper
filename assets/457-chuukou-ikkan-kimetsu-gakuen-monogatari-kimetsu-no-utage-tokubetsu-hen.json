    "content": "\n                Chuukou Ikkan!! Kimetsu Gakuen Monogatari: Kimetsu no Utage Tokubetsu-hen\" is an anime that had some special episodes created for the live event \"Kimetsu no Utage\" back in 2019. Although the art style is nothing extraordinary, it does the job. Now, when it comes to the dub, I'm usually a sub purist, but let me tell you, the only content I'd watch the dub for is this one. It's perfect to just have in the background as you do something productive, no need to actually pay attention to the content. So, if you're looking for something to play on the side while doing chores or working,give this a try, you won't regret it!\n"
