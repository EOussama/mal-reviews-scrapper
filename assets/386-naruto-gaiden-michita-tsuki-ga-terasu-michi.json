    "content": "\n                This one-off chapter takes place after the third chapter of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations and tackles the backstory of Mitsuki, of the main trio in short.\n\r\nIt feels really surreal to see Orochimaru in action shortly after the Boruto series kicks in, already doing some shady shit, plotting for the unknown, a Chekov's gun in the making.\n\r\nMitsuki goes through a personal struggle that slowly guides him to unlocking a power within, something Orochimaru always sought but never acquired, he was only a stepping stone in the path of making someone else have it at the end.\n\r\nThe entire chapter felt very dark, classic early Naruto vibe allover.\n"
