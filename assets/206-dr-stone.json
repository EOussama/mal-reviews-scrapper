This is not a nerdy math contest ploy, nor a boring middle-school science activity. It's a story of saving the world using science as a primary superpower.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nSightings of strange stone statues of birds have suddenly caught the attention of social media around the world, until one day, everyone on earth was suddenly petrified, indefinitely turned into stone statues of themselves without a second notice.\r\n3700 years later, one of the stone statues that shelled our protagonist was cracked, and he finally broke free.\r\nIt might seem odd that the first recorded petrification undoing was of someone that the hopes of humanity would never have a better bet for; enter Senku, a genius high schooler in the road of uncovering the mystery of the global petrification, aiming to undo the petrification and save the sleeping 7 billion lives in the process.\r\nEverything was going according to Senku's plan, the process was surely sped up after his friend Taiju broke through his petrification, but one day, after deciding on unpetrifiying a muscle-bound called Tsukasa for protection purposes, the advancement timeline introduced an unexpected turn. Shortly after, the ideals of Senku and Tsukasa started contradicting. Eventually, Senku's ideals of building a nation of science were in the way of Tsukasa's vision of a better future where the Boomers (if you will) should not be saved. A primitive war between two ideals started; even after a global reset, conflict was always the rational way to defend one's virtues.\n\r\nThe entire story linearly serializes itself, sort of like a game of Age of Empires would be. You have yourself several plans at the starting points, defining mid-breakpoints (age advancements) and a reward at the end to keep you motivated, and that brings Senku from crafting a wooden hatchet to re-inventing a light bulb. Resource gathering is always present at any given time, filling you with a sense of grind and exploration. A classic story about brains and brawn going at each other, creating many phenomenal crafts that have taken humanity millions of years to develop in no time, including the absolute galactic doctor -- Stone. That was a bad pun, but still, a clever way to title your Manga/Anime.\n\r\nThe real thrill of the story hides behind all of the mind-blowingly simplistic approaches to creating things, as facts about the first global petrification slowly unravel. Linking from pin to pin, a greater picture of the story takes a shape and form, becoming unfoggy bit by bit until the plot twists start accumulating leaving you in awes and appreciation.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThe least I can say about the art in Dr. Stone is that it was unique. Definitely a first for me, it has a weird mix between 90's Shoujo Anime and a twist on Steampunk. It feels very distinctive, especially compacted to anything else that was airing at the same time.\r\nThe only problem I find with this show on the visual level is the artistic choice of female character designs, it's debatable of course, however, there is just something about the females that almost feel as if they belong to a different series altogether when comparing them to the males. Is it the tiny months? Probably.\r\nThe background and faring landscapes make for great imagery of the setting that the story takes on, the jungles are denser, the skies are wider, clear from any sign of pollution, the wildlife looks healthy and the beaches feel endlessly vast.\n\r\n- Sound (9.5/10):\r\n\u201cOhayou Sekai good morning world\u201d. The first opening of the show sold it for me in the very first seconds. It just works, it's audibly pleasing, fun, and exciting. The second opening pales in comparison but still goes for a different vibe of itself. Both the ending songs are just as good, and the soundtrack is glorious, they blend well with the atmosphere and the primitive setting. I could be playing Age of Empires I or II, bobbing my head to the beat and enjoying the science show. Let me add that the melody on the title screens is amazing.\r\nThe voice acting feels so strangely wholesome, matching the fun tone of the show, sparkling with joy and passion. Asagiri's voice is probably my favorite, there is something very twisted yet so innocent with his performance, truely matches a mentalist with his status.\n\r\n- Characters (8.5/10):\r\nFor a show about science, the real start is the science itself, but it couldn't have been achieved without a capable group of devoted, hard-working people.\r\nSenku is a mastermind, he's a great example of an interesting and involving main character, a Shounen protagonist that is not dumb at the slightest or plays as so, in fact, quite the contrary, blowing minds with his intelligence and attentive ability to dissect, plan, and work ahead common problems. Asagiri springs malice at first, only to turn out he's a friendly one to keep, a soda lover, and a faithful ally. The rest of the cast follow in the same footsteps.\r\nTsukasa is a striking example of an intimidating villain that's proportionally scaled in terms of power. He can't blast mountain, but he can surely mess up your spine with a forceful pinch. The kind of raw physical power that can only be ruled under a strong non-primitive weapon. Embodying the very great foe that a science mind can have.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI was never the guy to pay attention in science classes, the math formulas and the dazzling amount of variables present at each time have always spun my focus aggressively, having me stare at the voice, wonder in thoughts, and do anything but pay attention to what's being said by the science teacher. Dr. Stone in the other hand stripped all of that complication process and turned it into a fun and engaging experience, something very simple to follow and be attentive to and extremely rewarding. It made me appreciate how far science has gone, and how much do we take it for granted. Having me week to week at the edge of my seat, it balances its humor and serious plot building to the max, so you never feel it's dragged out or too fast-paced for the largest portion of its run.\n\r\n- Overall (9/10):\r\nDr. Stone is a breeze of fresh air that we only get to experience once in a while in the Shounen game. It embraces its genre very well, making you feel at home with all the clich\u00e9 Shounen you could ever ask for, while in the same breath serving a different kind of sensation in the way it handles itself. It takes itself seriously, and respects the risks it introduces, and remains an enjoyable ride, filled with the same amount of hype and enthusiast sets up at the start. Science buff or not, prepare for a circus of science spectacle that for a change doesn't feel like a tiring sleepover session for a lot of folks.\n"
