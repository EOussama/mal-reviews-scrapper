    "content": "\n                For so long we asked for something like this, the straw hats getting to spend time together, goofing around and stuff, It's always good to have fun, the new world has been a great problem, where we didn't get to see the crew all out somewhere, with no care in the world, good times.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nIf we were to be more specific, there is no actual story or so to speak, \u201cPlot\u201d to this short special, you get to see the straw hats sailing towards Gran Tesoro while they are imagining how fun it would be to be there, the only thing that's worth keepingyou watching is seeing the taw hats interact more friendly, doing those fun group activities, competition, joking around and all, but really, more than anything, I guess the studio unleashed their wild imagination and blessed the Name-Robbin fan service beggars with such a treat.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nIt looks fascinating, to say the least, the faces are done very accurately, the frames are fluid, even the physics were spot on, especial on -you-know-where.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nNothing remarkable, but at least, it blended with the atmosphere of the short, really, nothing to complain about, that would be your last worries, as the visuals are more catching, and would probably keep you immersed more than the music.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nOne Piece is rich with unique characters, this scoring point could be deceiving to some, the only thing behind it is the lack of new characters, while we get to see our familiar crew faces, they are more focused one in this short, and their interactions are what really distinguishes this from your weekly episodes.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nDid I laugh at the reoccurring jokes every time? Yes, I indeed did, even more so on Sanji and Zoro's interactions, there differently should be canon episode on this, on the straw hats spending good times together, I enjoyed this more than I thought, and I absolutely love to see new shorts like this.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nWould I recommend this? It's certainly not for everyone, only your hardcore One Piece fans out there that really want to see more of their favorite crew members, It's not necessary at all to watch this prequel before watching the movie Film: Gold, or at all really.\n"
