I'm not getting paid to give a deceiving review, and I'm not a slave to my nostalgia either. This is an unbiased review of the series Baccano! that gets a lot of praise from people and much like Cowboy Bebop (great series by the way) that gets called an overrated mediocre piece of work just because most of the people are not on good terms with either the settings, animation, or taste. Written by the same author of Durarara!!, andproduced by the same studio too, it tells a story of a greater scale, greater perspective, and of greater meaning.\n\r\n- Story (9.5/10):\r\nIf you're a fan of Durarara!! you are most likely to adore Baccano! for they have more similarities than snow and ice. With unique storytelling methods, it can get really confusing as it keeps jumping between multiple timelines and places with no prior warning, focusing on way more characters than the average Fred can keep up with (no offense in here).\r\nThe narrative in Baccano! is a character in itself, the main one, in fact, you see what he or she sees, hear what they hear, and think what they think.\r\nThe main 4 time periods the series focuses on have more characters and motives in common than the digits they are formed by, makes you wonder how 1711, 1930, 1931, and 1932 can all be connected in a much deeper scale, the shift on focus can be very staggering at times where you would switch settings on the most intense and climactic moments going back and forth between the multiple time and spaces.\r\nThis is a series that requires immense attention and focus, dropping a single friction of care might lead you to slip up on some important detail that might turn up to be crucial to link the events together. Despite covering more than one time period, the Victorian New York vibe is the one that has the strongest presence for what it involves of characters, a lot of mafia wars, thieves getting themselves in massive underground trouble, and scientists in the hiding unraveling the secrets of immortality, all linked by two shared aspects, torture, and murder.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nThe art style for starters looks very generic and recognizable, similar to those 20s anime series that you used to encounter back in the day on TV, it's not by any means bad or mindblowing, but it's good for what it does.\r\nIt tends to portray the time periods magnificently and seeing how the story takes place in the united states, it really stands out as it puts non-Asian characters in perspective, I mean the characters in design look as American as Uncle Sam.\r\nOne other thing that lights up the mood were the amazing backgrounds, they felt dynamic and that of a depth of place where the characters end up interacting a lot with, you could almost say they were their own characters, as we get to see the story from different perspectives, and as the saying goes, \u201cWalls have ears\u201d, they might as well end up having eyes, and a will of their own (this is anime, so yeah, I'm sane, don't worry about me).\r\nProbably the most outstanding thing about this was the animation, there are those fast-paced action moments where you get to see exchanges of blows, bullets, Swifty parkour and amazing hand to hand combat, those greatness worth of frames do their job perfectly, I would find myself replaying several parts just to get some taste from that eye candy.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nWith such a legendary time period, comes a real challenge of adopting the correct music and soundtracks, and oh boy do they know what they were doing. You can never get enough of that Jazz bass that kicks in in the most badass moments and with a use of sound effects the likes of which put Disney's to shame, you'd almost feel a tingle in your eardrum.\r\nNo, before you come attacking me, I watched the English dubbed version, and good lord was it a fantastic one, this is one of if not the greatest well-made dubbs you'd ever get the pleasure of hearing, it's so good that it makes you feel like it is the way it was meant to be watched, I'm pairing this one with Cowboy Bebop's dubbing right off the bat.\r\nNot only all of the characters have a fitting tone of voices, they nailed the Boston and New York accents of portrayed eras, it was a grand fiesta of quality performance like no other.\n\r\n- Character (10/10):\r\nOh boy, I was dying to talk about the characters. As you might know, there are a lot of series that are story driven, others action driven and so on, but I haven't seen a series that's this heavy character driven, if you would take a look on the character list you would be overwhelmed about how many main characters there are for a series this short, and they all manage to get almost the same screen time, ALMOST. But certainly, no character is neglected or cast away, and every single one of them has a big role in the circulation of the events.\r\nAlong with this wild journey span multiple great characters, and also couples and duos, some of them are just relationship goals, so interesting and likable that they make you beg for a series for each individual of them, I personally found myself attached to every one of them no matter how vicious or arrogant they were.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nNow, I didn't get the type enjoyment I thought I would, expecting to have a historian adventure I was greeted by a guy blasting a kid with a shotgun to the head, in fact, I was doubting finishing the series halfway through, but it was the payoff at the end that made it worthy of that time, the series takes its time to shape up a clear image of what it wants to tell, and only after confusing the heck out of you, it will reveal itself like the artifact it is. Because of how hard it was to keep up with the wide character spread and the fast-paced change of time and space it was very easy to lose attention and interest most of the time, but that was the point, the plot tries to deceive you, throw you off so that you don't pick up the various plot hints through the progression. And in that, it amped up the suspense and made the slightest boring pieces of dialogues intense and noteworthy. Probably what draws me this much to the series now that I've seen it, is how amazingly satisfying it was to see everything come together at the end, all of those loose ends and parts of dialogs and shown events finally made sense.\n\r\n- Overall (9.1/10):\r\nNow, this isn't the kind of shows you would expect a younger audience to grasp, and I understand, for each their intellectual capacities, this is a gory animation, it has a lot of violence, a lot of adult verses and mature topics discussed, so unless you're in the right age and can keep up with confusing plots you might enjoy this, it's really expensive on attention and carefulness, so unless you can 100% focused on the story and not bothered with anything else like thinking about something else while watching or trying to multitask something while seeing it you will enjoy the seat, and just hang in there, if it didn't make sense, it eventually will.\n"
