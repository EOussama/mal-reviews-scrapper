They have been slaying every other song they do, only bangers and never a miss. But I feel like Idol was the moment they really took over the podium and are as close to being the Anime song face in the industry, and I think that\u2019s still an understatement of how influential and popular this song got.\n\r\nThe whole context of this opening is someta in nature, as it doesn't touch on the whole \u201cIdol\u201d topic with a blend of melancholy and dark undertones whilst also remaining very upbeat and lucky feeling, nailing the style that YOASOBI is known for.\n\r\nEnough about the song itself, as I\u2019ll never do it justice trying to paint it as the main star when it\u2019s even bigger than that. the visuals were stunning, amazing, and head-bopping as well, it almost tells a tale on its own, I could watch it on mute and still hear the beat inside my skull.\n"
