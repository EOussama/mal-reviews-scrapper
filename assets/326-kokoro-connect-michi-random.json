I have no idea, for that would have surely raised the rating of the TV show marginally, it felt like the well-deserved ending that the show gravely lacked.\n\r\nYes, the fact that the plot yet AGAIN revolves about Nagase is extremely tiring to think about, it feels like she already had her arc completed already so these OVAs felt like milking an already dead cow. But surprisingly, it had a better execution than her arc had in the original series.\n\r\nFinally, every character had a deserving shining moment, a whole 12 episodes series lacked thisbut this OVA came with a save. I like that the most.\n\r\nStory (7.2/10)\r\nArt (7/10)\r\nSound (7.5/10)\r\nCharacters (7/10)\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\r\nOverall (7.14/10)\n"
