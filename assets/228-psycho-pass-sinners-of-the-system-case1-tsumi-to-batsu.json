    "content": "\n                Watching Psycho-pass for the first time was such an experience, but that was ages ago. I have coupled through the second season, it turned out decent, not as bad as people say, of course, when you're missing one of the best antagonists \u201cMakashima\u201d, then it's excusable.\r\nThe brutal detective thriller has started to fade out of my memories, with only the biggest moments still brought up by me to this day on my Anime discussions, but watching through this movie was like cycling through my collective memory folders that relate to this Anime, remember every detail fro the series as I sit through the whole thing.\n\r\nStory(7/10):\r\nSomething I found very un-Pasycho-Pass-y is the simplistic outline of the plot. I couldn't help but notice how straight forward the whole thing is, with the movie starting up by setting a mental facility. Introducing characters whom expressions scream if \u201cI'm the bad guy\u201d. It felt like a solved case as soon as it began, which made it more of an action-oriented case than one that demands critical thinking and mystery thriller that the parent show excelled at.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI'm always a complainer whenever I see CGI heavily used on an Anime, however, Psycho-Pass has always been one of the exceptions. The 2D and 3D elements communicate flawlessly, sometimes, even hiding the fact that what's going on the screen is fully CG.\r\nCharacter design is one of the strongest visual strength that I love about this series. It does the realistic anatomy so well, that you might mistake it as a rotoscoped live action. I like the backgrounds as well as how well they manage to blend all the animated elements into a fully digestible visual package.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nHearing the first opening of the first season was all I needed to approve this aspect of the movie. It is just so good, it stands the test of time and it brought back the same chills it did back when I was first watching the series episode by episode.\r\nThe voice acting is appreciable, no overly-cute moe moans, just a trembling audion that shows how horrifying the played scenario is.\r\nThe OSTs are spanking, straight up.\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\r\nWhat I think is a reason enough for anyone to watch this movie lies in the characters. No, I don't mean the general cast, but speaking specifically about Miku.\r\nIt's a popular opinion in the fandom how hated Miku is. I sided with the same mentality here, but not for so long.\r\nIt seems like a character arc for her, this entire movie is just her taking on a case, showing us the third party, how it's done, she no longer whines, she no longer hesitates. She is the inspector everyone wanted her to become.\r\nA word for the antagonists, not anything that leaves a lasting impression, pretty forgettable if you asked me as I'd take any minor village from the TV show over these two.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nWhat a comeback. Just about to time delve into the three movies and the third season, and oh boy, I say it again. What a start.\r\nJust the kind of movies that puts you on the run, a quick recap of what the show is about, building up for what to come next.\r\nAlthough the case at hand was not anything of immersing like the show spoiled us, but the spirit and the adrenaline rush is there when the moment calls for it.\n\r\nOverall (7.8/10):\r\nFor a long-time-breaker, someone that hasn't seen the show in what counts by the ages, yes, definitely see it. It is not going to give you anything new per se. But it does bring back the topping and the appeal of the first two seasons. I would still put the first major movie \u201cPsycho-Pass: The movie\u201d above this any day though.\n"
