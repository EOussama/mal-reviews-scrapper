You have to admit that the show does a lot of good deeds it becomes hard to nitpick the minor flaws it has. But that doesn't make any less of an excuse for such a big budget production that has remained faithful to the fans throughout its serialization.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nThis season, in particular, was the connecting point for a lot of past foreshadowing and clues that filled the entirety of the 3 seasons, a lot of plot-changing reveals and game-shifting events wrapped. The series has changedinto a course we never expected when it first debuted, which magnificent and proper character development for the majority of the main cast.\r\nThe pacing was not at its hight, I can arguably say that season 2 had was better paced, probably due to the hyper action sequences it had.\r\nSomething I did not like was how Levi turned from an interesting character to being a lame plot device that's used whenever the show needs to justify or get away with something, but unfortunately, most people think that an overpowered character is an example of a well-written character. Which in Levi's case was relatively expanded on in the previous season, however, his power flexing spoils a lot of the plot. It could have been more creative to have a better way for the \u201cgoodies\u201d to have an arsenal up their sleeves rather than a flexing boi in a green cape.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nI'm going to say that the series has had some better days, visually speaking. It felt that this cour had probably the worse production value on a greater scale compared to the other seasons, it seems like they started running out of money, but who am I kidding, this series sales like a God's church.\r\nThe color palette remained as gloomy and medieval as ever (except for the last part of the final episode, but I think that was a great decision regarding the emotional impact of that moment, as depicting freedom as a brighter, much livelier colorful atmosphere).\r\nThe anatomy was kind of off at times, out of shape faces and overgrown heads, you see, that's what the real problem the animation department had, consistency. I guess that this show really needs years-long breaks in order to retain the same high production value, but you know we are not going to be able to hold it for another 4 years, especially that the final season is probably in the making.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nLeave it to \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d for the final flex, really, the voice acting cast know what they are doing the whole time, for a show filled with emotional hits all the time, you really need a capable talented group of people that can deliver the same feels that matches the emotion animated on their faces. And you know this season had a lot of those moments especially.\r\nThe opening theme song this time around felt like a mix of all the other 4 openings, you don't know what one to use, just smash them together, and it worked.\r\nI'm not so sure about the ending theme song, not the best in the show, but also not that bad.\r\nThe OTS is just another thing that you just have to hand it to \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d, taking down Titans takes a lot than slicing their back-necks off, it takes a strong, hype and blood-boiling soundtracks that make you imitate the boys as they go about their freedom-seeking duty.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nWatching the first episode of the franchise and some random episode from this season back to back would totally feel like an entirely different Anime, the biggest change would be how different everybody is.\r\nEren went full 180deg on us, from a screaming angry \u201cI'm going to slaughter all the titans\u201d boy to a more mature and quite strategy enforcer that understands the bigger picture and realizes a greater goal than just ripping apart giants' neck.\r\nErmin received quite the recognition that's totally deserved regarding everything he did for humanity as they know it, gained a lot of courage and experience and is no longer the shy oppressed slim boy he used to be. Basically, everybody else has had a noticeable development so far, and I would say that except for Mikasa if anything, she's still as dead in the eyes and as concerned the whole time as ever. Levi is just the same thing, I guess there must be something with this Ackerman clan.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nNot the best season of \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d in my opening, there was a lot of praise and hype that I totally bought, but it ended up extremely disappointing, especially for the \u201ccontroversially-top-rated\u201d episode that caused a lot of buzz-talk for a couple of weeks, I literally found that the episode after that was ways better, buy into hype was a lesson I had to learn sooner or later, but even so, it was not enough to ruin a great show.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nIf you've already watched 2 seasons and a split cour for this show, then there is really no excuse to not watch this second cour too, for how good of an investment you already made, grab a drink, watch some recaps, and just dive in, it really was a different kind of mix between the good ol' action-packed \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d and the massively political spirited part 1 of the 3rd season.\n"
