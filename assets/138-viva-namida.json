    "content": "\n                It feels like writing a review on a five minute worth of content would be way too overkill and desperate to fill this empty review section, well, that might be part of it, but really, you can't just turn your head the other way after you've just witnessed the greatness of Viva Namida, that's something you do when you're finally finished with the shitty guilty pleasure WatchMojo binge session.\n\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nAbsolutely stunning, speaking at an aesthetic level here. The odd alteration of bright color that flawlessly catches your attention on every frame only complimented by the fluid movements and the classy dances moves that flows nicelywith the beat. It feels very 80-ish in its rocky atmosphere, the sort of you'd find at a crowded club from the era.\n\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nThe music is pretty much the \u201ccheerleading queen\u201d of the special. Without a doubt, just like the animation with its dated feel (Dated but really good), it does hold up to the same amount of quality, obviously, I don't speak Japanese, at least, not at the native level, so, me grasping the lyrics was out of the question, however, the beat and rhymes were enough to have me appreciate the treat my ears were getting.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nThat was just my kind of treat on a moody day like this one, I forgot the cold weather I was hiding from under my pile of warm blankets and went straight up into a mindless dancing imitation rampage, soothing I could much the professional leading figure on the screen. That was a worthy warm up if I do say so myself.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nThis was a short one, but a memorable one as it is. Definitely going into my special playlist it kind of reminds me of the Jango special from One Piece.\n"
