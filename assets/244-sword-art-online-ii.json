The crude and bland view it influences is the furthest away from being pleasant, and drawing any enjoyment from it is also a sign of mental incapability and social inferiority. is not only nightmare hunting. That is the image people want you to think about Sword Art Online as a whole, probably the biggest factor of me diving in with absolutely zero expectations, well, love it or hate it, SAO is none ofthe above. Ask the haters, they will say otherwise and ask the fans, they will say; \u201cDo you mean SAO II\u201d?\r\nWeird how even in one of the most controversial Anime shows, there is an even more controversial sequel that both the fans and the haters agree on it being straight-up bad. But hey, it's a matter of taste, and taste is very subjective.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nPeople will complain, why is it even called SAO when the plot is hardly about the game SAO anymore, Well, SAO is still very much present in both concept and physical way. The VRMMORPJ trend that started with SAO is still very much strong and present, not only that but pretty much every other trendy game is built up upon The Seed, a fragment from SAO's core.\n\r\nI would get it over with here and now, both arcs from the first season were miles better than anything showcased in SAO II. With that said, aside from the side story episode \u201cCalibur\u201d, SAO II has a decent standing in that regard, averagely mediocre, yes, but they do build upon what the first season ended up on and also expand on the world and the SAO lore.\n\r\nThe first arc, the \u201cPhantom Bullet\u201d was a very sudden and fast switch from close combat centered conflicts to fast-paced ranged battles where in theory, Kirito is at a great disadvantage, but hey, protagonist power boost, so let's just ignore that. I'm going to say, the massive switch in settings was a refreshing new perspective that I never asked for, but enjoyed every moment of. You'd think that SAO would have lost a great deal of what makes it itself, turned out the in-characters drama, and plot mysteries is what carried both seasons all along.\r\nThe plot of this first arc really relates to the Aincrad arc, it brings back the past and makes Kirito run on his toes all the time and upping up the stakes. It is yet a thrilling life and death situation, we really missed that on the Fairy Dance arc.\n\r\nRight after, a confusingly placed mini-arc that kind of lets the plot take a breather by following the cast on an ALO quest to retrieving the legendary Excalibur, it really shows the hustle that Kirito spoke off when he was able to summon it against the rapist villain from the Fairy Dance arc. It felt a little bit slow and more of a chore to follow, but thankfully, it was a short one.\n\r\nFinally, the concluding arc, \u201cMother's Rosario\u201d. Now, let me start by stating, I'm a grown man, and it's been years since an Anime was this close to making tear up, but damn it, that was a blurry, watery vision for at least 2 minutes.\r\nThe first and proper arc to focus on Asuna, a lot of development from hers, getting to see more of her perspective and her relationship with her family, it was a nice change from the Kirito-Sugo dosage.\r\nA very depressing arc with an amazing resolution that really makes you think.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nOn the visual level, SAO II hardly made any improvements if at all, even looking at the 2 years gap and the massive popularity of the series.\r\nWith that said, we do get some fleshed peasing animation on the big fights and important moments. The expressions are very sold-out and nailed at times, the color palettes are amazingly matched, as we see in the colorful ALO and the dim and dusty GGO.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nLet's talk openings and endings, I guess it's a stable now, one of the strongest aspects of the series thus far, they never fail to deliver on the quality of the vocals in that regard. The endings though are a bit of a grower.\r\nThe voice acting was fantastic, especially with Asuna for how massive of a spectacle she had.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nI've praised the character aspect all the way to now, I really liked Kirito's struggle during the Phantom Bullet arc, it really added a lot to what he accomplished and show off his growth, but the real star of the season is really Asuna, I did not expect the show to focus on anybody to that degree that does not fall under the name Kirito, but hey, I was easily at home in that regard. The fact that Asuna started, for me at least, as just another female support character to possibly a better, more fleshed out character than Kirito himself says a lot about her arc.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nDue to the slightly slow pacing of the season, it really hurt the experience a notch, it definitely dragged out on many occasions, but the thrill was always there. So far, SAO has been hitting close to home in both seasons, but this one, although not as great as the first one, it definitely felt friendlier and easier to follow, perhaps, all thanks to the first season for making us familiar with the characters and more aware of their world, but it goes without saying.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nI guess, if you already made it through the first season, what's stopping you from jumping ion this one? You don't have to start from scratch, although, you do get thrown into an entirely different game with different rules and different stakes.\r\nIf you're more of a character guy as well, you'll be right at home as well, Asuna, Kirito, and some other new faces do make out the cut and show off a new side of themselves.\n"
