    "content": "\n                Well, there we meet again, another season of SAO to unite us all like the usual. You know already, this is either a miss or hit, nothing in between.\r\nAlicization started very strong and great, setting up new hights which sadly ended up partially abandoning them in War of Underworld, and again, spoiler alert, did not remain faithful to the first Alicization season and continued messing around with anything good it had going for it.\r\nLet me elaborate.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nThe half-baked plot of this season resolves the entire Alicization saga, or it appeared to do so until the last horrible 5 minutes of the show which completely changedthe subjective rating of the whole Alicization arc.\r\nThe pace shifted from mildly slow to fast action paced battle royal as soon as Kirito came back to the spotlight.\r\nI, however, liked how some previous loose ends of the plot were utilized and brought back to play a role in this season like Akihiko.\n\r\nArt (8.8/10):\r\nIf anything, this series only knows an increase in visual production thanks to anything else. Just like the previous Alicization seasons, the particle effects are incredible, way ahead of most modern shows and movies.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nAgain, the OSTs in this season were incredible, even more so than the animation. The opening and the ending songs are also S class, truly living to the name of SAO when it comes to bangers.\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\r\nThe only character that seemed to have developed was Alice, the rest, not so much. The villain got some backstory that accompanies you through what made him the way he is, cool call back to season one as well and how Kirito related to him indirectly.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nNo matter the flaws, no matter how bad the situation turns out to be, SAO was never the show that defines the blueprint for storytelling, it does what it sets up to do, doesn't make up impossible promises, it's just there for the OG fans to enjoy which is what makes it bearable the most.\n\r\nOverall (7.76/10):\r\nI mean, the same thing is said about every other SAO season, you've already made it out here, why stop now? Season 2 was subjectively where the show hit its lowest low, it doesn't get any lower than that, so no matter how bad this season is, it still has a lot of redeeming quality, if anything, the visuals and the angelic soundtracks make the most of what it's worth.\n"
