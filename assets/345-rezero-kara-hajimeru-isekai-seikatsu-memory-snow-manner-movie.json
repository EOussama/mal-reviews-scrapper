I guess, as all of us grew up, we got used to people telling us all sorts of things under the title of \u201cmanners\u201d. Well, behold, this Re:Zero dude is trying to educate the mass on proper movie etiquette but listing a bunch of DOs and DONTs.\n\r\nI guess the budget was just that big it started swelling in form of these types of shorts that really serve nothing else but act as an annoying branding ploy. At least, I gotta hand it to the marketing department responsible for this,they are not quitting until Subaru or anyone of his waifus is finally a universal mascot.\n\r\nI did not watch the feature movie in a cinema, me watching this was solely for the purpose of checking something off my watch list, not that I'm complaining, thank got it took no time sacrifice to be scarce.\n"
