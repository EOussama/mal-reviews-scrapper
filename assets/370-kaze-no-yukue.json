Upon hearing the song in Film Redand again in the One Piece anime, I thought the accompanying visuals were okay, they did the trick, and they reflected well on the theme of the song, but man the visuals that ship with the song is something else let me tell you, stunning, out of the world. It's like a mix of Ghibli films and world-class clay art that felt like reading through a magical children's book.\n\r\nLong story short, listen to Ado more often. Also, is it a coincidence that the names Oda and Ado are a semordnilap? Fate works in mysterious ways.\n"
