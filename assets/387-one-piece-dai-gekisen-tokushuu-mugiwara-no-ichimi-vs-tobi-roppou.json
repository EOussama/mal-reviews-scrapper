    "content": "\n                A classic Wano recap, what else is there not to love? I like that tey compiled the climaxes together in one episode, it might seem relentless for weekly viewers, but I'm sure this is such a time saver for people who've been keeping away from the series or for Manga readers who wanted to peek into what the Anime got to offer.\n\r\nIf you're az fan of Chibi Zoro and Sanji, there you go. A field trip. Other wise, you've got a recap to all Strawhats vs. Tobitoppo fights.\r\nIt's a surprise to no one that the real start of this episode was the next episode's preview,and if you're a Manga reader, you know that two of the best fights so far are about to start.\n"
