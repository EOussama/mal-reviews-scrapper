That alone speaks a lot of volumes on what made me despise the greater part of the series were a lot of nitpicks here and there that brought a promising assemble to a horribly average (And that's still a stretch) to the land of mainstream trash. And no, being mainstream is never enough a reason to call a show average.\n\r\nThis 40 minutes long recap goes through the first 8 episodes of the show, highlighting the plot defining moments, which arguable I would say, were the best part of aseries that kept on driving down the hill to a point of no return. It was such a great and fun sit through that made me wish the rest of the show was this good and bearable so that I can get on a rewatch. It seems reality was clear and unforgiving.\n"
