And it's been over 20 years as of now, and it's still going strong if not stronger than ever.\r\nBut let's go back in time, back, back... back, before the story had an Anime adaptation. Part of a tour of short animations, a certain piece of animation made it an entry under the name \u201cOne Piece: Taose! Kaizoku Ganzack\u201d, and I'm sure that even then, a lot of people ended up sleeping on its truepotential to flourish, and look at it now. Brighter than ever.\n\r\nOk, let's get it out of the way, the animation, for something from the 90s, you can easily get a fuzzy picture on what it would look like on your head, that's probably why I was surprised the most, of course, not because of the out-of-nowhere insane high resolution of the time (and it had none of that), but mainly because of the satisfactory fluid animation that spans almost the entirety of the OVA continuously, something even early Toei One Piece never scaled up to.\n\r\nThe main cast, composed of Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, making it the story fit somewhere in between of Orange Town and Syrup Village arcs, Nami is as betraying as ever, Luffy just as goofy and glutton as they come, and Zoro as infamous and widely recognizable as he's always been. The trio got themselves involved into saving an island that was overrun by pirates, and to be honest, it was as generic of a setup as the classic One Piece we're grown to love.\r\nDock into an island or be forced to land on it, make a move on the villain, get captured, escape death, learn about the story of the island, head back for a second round, beat the bad guy, set to sea for more information. Grindy but effective.\n\r\nAs I was waiting for One Piece episode 884 to download (slow internet), it was a great deal of time for until then, I'm sure it's going to be weird shifting between a pre-One Piece adventure to the intense events of the Levely arc, but for what it is, it sure made for a good watch.\n\r\nOverall score: (6.8/10)\n"
