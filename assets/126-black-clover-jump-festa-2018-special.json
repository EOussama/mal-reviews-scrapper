This was almost an insult.\r\nI get they were trying to pull something off on the fans as a sort of thank you for your support, but they could have gone a different way and still make it better.\r\nThe humor in this was just one forced shitfest that tried a lot harder and ended up very cringy and with no results. There were key moments and jokes that get to you, but only as far as making you almost crack a smile, nothing more.\r\nThe stupid looking hatswere there and got me triggered on how color vibrant they are, which doesn't fit in the cold atmosphere of Black Clover, they stood out way too much it was annoyingly distracting, and let's not forgot how weirdly American they look, totally ruined a lot of the episode.\n"
