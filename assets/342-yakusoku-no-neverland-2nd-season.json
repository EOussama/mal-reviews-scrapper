We deserved better than this.\r\nI feel like, more Geneva conventions were violated in the making of this sequel than the whole time the conventions were put in place, after the fantastic first season, this should not have the right to exist.\n\r\nThere is so much wrong with this half baked adaptation, as an Anime only, I was fine in the first three episodes, but trust me when I say, my rating wentfrom a high 8 to a low 4 with a single line of dialogue, after many attempts at balancing my rating, I concluded 6/10 is fair enough of this unfair adaptation, and here's why.\n\r\nThe lore dump we get exposed to at the very beginning was very much needed, it created such a high ceiling that the series needed to exceed, it seems it shot for too much. The sudden return of a certain character, along with frequent, nonchalant, unnoticed jumps in times, the series was beyond saving, and even then it kept going lower with no intention to slow down. The slap on the camel's back was with the final episode's slideshow, you could have believed for a moment that maybe, a third season might be able to pull off something miraculous and save face, but no; Powerpoint\u2122 slideshows left and right, not only ruining any chance of repair but also spoiling anyone who was intended to read the Manga afterward. What a tastless, out-of-season April joke.\n\r\nCredit where credit is due I guess, the Animation was great, shockingly great in fact, the outer world felt so magical and with the right amount of screen spacing and color displacement, it really came out to reality. The sound design was incredible as well, phenomenal voice acting, as usual, it's just a shame that went it mattered the most, the best thing about the franchise, which was writing, wasn't really there.\n\r\nOverall: 6.8/10\n"
