If you have made it this far, congratulations. While nothing groundbreaking has been shown in these movies so far, a lot of plot conflicts have been showcased in which are going to wrap up the next movie. So buckle up.\n\r\nI would say that this sequel was the least action-heavy out of the previous three, a lot of talking has been done, a lot of focus on politics and whatnot, and it isn't bad to say the least,just a different process for the story altogether.\r\nI would, however, like to point out the excessive plot armor that has been bugging me thus far. It seems that kind of armor makes the stronger Nightmare in the universe of Code Geass, if it is on your side, you ARE the victor.\n\r\nIt took me four movies to realize how much I love some of the OSTs and the ending song, which sure will be missed once this series ends for good. And if you were asking when that is, and whether this was the last episode/movie, then I'd have to say that \u201cThere is another\u201d.\n"
