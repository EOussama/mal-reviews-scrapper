    "content": "\n                Once you hit the play button, it feels like an eternity even though it's just 5 minutes an episode. That was really boring and very hard to keep track with, and honestly, not worth the effort. It's like playing of one VSauce's videos at x3 speed, so much trivia all over the place with a bad sense of humor, (not that Micheal is not funny). The animation didn't help either.\r\nThe main focus of this specials was the different foods that get brought up, they go from Tarako Spaghetti, Pudding, Curry... I forgot what the last one was, probably that poor parrot. The title SOS probablymeant \u201cShortcake of Strawberry\u201d, that would complement the nature of the special.\n"
