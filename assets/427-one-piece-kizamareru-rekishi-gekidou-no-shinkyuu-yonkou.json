More like an informative profile on all new and old emperors.\n\r\nAt least it gets points for being different, with mini Zoro and Brook being narrators.\n\r\nWith Whitebeard, Kaido, Big Mom, Shanks, Blackbeard, Luffy, and Buggy being all emperors of the past and present, it\u2019s while 7 characters have had that title so far, and only one of them hasn\u2019t been replaced yet. With what it seems like it, it feels that Shanks will be taken out byBlackbeard, but so far, all past emperors were taken out by non-emperor characters and got replaced by bystanders, it would be weird to have Shanks be the outlier.\n"
