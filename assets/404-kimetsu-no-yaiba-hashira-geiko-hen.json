It already felt like that last season, but during this one, it\u2019s been officially sealed.\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need me to tell you what makes Kimetsu no Yaiba worth the watch, chances are, if you\u2019re reading this then you\u2019ve already caught up to the point when you\u2019d want to watch the next season in line. But let\u2019s address a common concern in the fandom about this season now. It\u2019s the pacing.\n\r\nAlthough I didn\u2019t have any problems with it per se, that would leave me wantingto rant about it, but a lot of people expected a bit more action, especially from a show that relies heavily on its phenomenal action scenes. There were a lot more slice-of-life elements than in any other season. It\u2019s been slow, relaxing, and more character-oriented.\n\r\nI guess an arc like the Hashira Training was very much needed, for how intense the last couple of arcs have been, we needed a breather. We had to slow down momentarily as the show had been closing its conclusion.\n\r\nFor me, personally, it had been one of the weaker seasons for sure, for the same reasons I mentioned above. But still way above average for a seasonal show nevertheless. It was not the production, but the arc itself.\n\r\nOverall: 7.68/10.\n"
