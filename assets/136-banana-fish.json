For a Manga from the years 1985-1994 to only receive an Anime adaptation after 24 years from its conclusion, which compliments perfectly the number of episodes it has (I don't know if that was an act of coincidence or made or purpose) sure was a surprise to all of us, and it was a welcomed one.\r\nThe show isoften met by a lot of homophobic criticism as it heavily deals with gay references and implies heavily on that, those are probably the people that miss the point from the story as the case with the characters that can really be substituted by anybody else and still carry on the plot in the same manner.\r\nI feel like, for that alone, the majority of bad reviews come from those type of people that couldn't handle a simple plot device and ended up trashing the whole franchise without even (Most likely) properly finishing it.\r\nOne other side note to make, don't let the fact that this show is labeled as \u201cShoujo\u201d fool you, it doesn't hold back on diving into torture, child pornography and abusive content at all. So beware.\n\n\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nOne guy was blessed with beauty and strength. Something deeply desired by the average human being is only met with a faith worse than that of a stray dog. We're talking hoodlum of the streets and lowlife gangs, government conspiracies and threatening life and the doorstep of a brutal crime family in the unforgiving streets of New York, such is the life of Ash.\r\nThat is until he met this innocent Japanese dude that clearly was playing with fire without even realizing it.\r\nThe plot in general moves at a very considerable pace, neutrally fast natured, action-packed and also doesn't fall short on contrasting the amount of action with an overdose of homosexual encounters. As it follows the story of an abused young kid, it captured perfectly the horror of what was the hell poor Ashlan had to deal with from an extremely young age to his now 17/18 years old self.\r\nI personally am not into the homosexuality side of the show, but it doesn't really matter in the greatest side of things, because there was still a plot to carry on down the road, and as the show tried to clear out, those are real-world problems and we just have to face them at one point or another.\r\nThe biggest problem with this show is the unbalanced choice of turnarounds. The plot relies heavily on a repetitive cat and mouse game that does really get into your nerve at a certain point. Like seriously, every single arc was just the same thing, only having different characters involved. And what was even lamer, it only revolved around this unwanted stranger (Eiji) that every part targeted him for being the supposed \u201cweakness\u201d of Ashlan. It really gets lame after a while.\r\nAside from the action and thrill filling the screen, there was a great part of the story occupied only with sadness and sorrow, grief at the corner of every backstory there is, which by the way was all concerning Ash.\r\nI get that the story revolves mainly about him, but that's pouring too much focus the guy that a lot of other great characters are easily neglected and untouched upon.\n\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\r\nThis is only noticeable after a little while. It is no doubt that the series was greatly produced from a visual side. Not only was it set in an American setting, but it felt like another Hollywood adaptation with the way the camera angles were and the action scenes in particular. You could tell how American the show felt just by analyzing the cinematography that went on all camera shots and direction in general.\r\nThe weakest point here was the inconsistency of art style. It's not the fault of the source material being that old and so it had its mark of age visually speaking. The original artwork has its charm as well, but the majority of the time, there was a continuous shift between the original art style and a more modern take at times, especially considering character design and faces. It was most apparent from side shots where a character looks dated seen from the side until he or she turns him or her head directly at the camera when it's suddenly this very +2010 type of art style.\r\nThat really did nothing to hold back the series per se, however, it was worth noting how uncanny of them that was. Going either by the original art style or a new modernized one would have had the same effect, but mixing to very different and distinguishable was kind of weird.\r\nNot to close an eye on animation, for that one was very well taken care of. Studio MAPPA invested some clearly-felt effort in this adaptation with their cleanly animated fight scenes, especially the ones involving epic martial art and bullet exchange.\n\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nI'm just going to jump straight into complimenting Hirata Hiroaki, the same legend behind the voice over of Sanji from One Piece. It was impossible for me to unhear that as soon as I realized it.\r\nAsh's performance by Uchida Yuuma, a figure not that well known in the medium, at least compared to somebody like Max's voice actor (Hirata Hiroaki), but apparently, talent isn't tied to how big your name is, and thus, I won't blame you if you thought that performance was the result of some world-class voice actor because I know I thought the same. Mr. Yuuma really carried on that role perfectly seeing how much of the emotional shifts they series goes through, from screaming of anger to crying in pain, it felt natural either way.\r\nI can't say I got an enormous enjoyment from the collection of soundtracks used here, sure they highlighted some of the intense gunfights, but it was too intense most of the time that it was hard to even notice.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were of another league. I wasn't the one appreciating them from the first encounter, but they sure grow on you that you're too attached to let go when they are changed, and the same happens with the new ones just shortly after.\n\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\r\nI was greatly disappointed when it came for characters.\r\nAsh was clearly given most of the spotlights if not all of them, as hard and catastrophic everything was for him, you could at least beg for a wider selection of interesting characters. Yes, there were plenty of exciting faces, but the show wasted a huge opportunity to invest in them.\r\nThe only characters I think of that had the greatest character development in the show were Ash and Sing. And still, Sing lacked any interesting backstory or anything of that sort to better explain his motives, he was just there as sort of a replacement for another character that died.\r\nThere were some really brilliant faces, like Blanca, Max, Shorter, Yut-Lung and I could only keep going, too bad it went all to waste.\r\nThe show really only seem to focus on a character if it was doomed into dying the next episode, it almost became like an obvious pattern to their death sentences.\r\nOne other very weak aspect was the constant buffing of Ash's profile and the extraordinary amount of plot armor. Ash was introduced as this cold killed that didn't care much for the higher power and was just doing what he always did in order to survive. Until they kept up throwing plot devices like how incredibly of a high IQ he had. And I don't really care if he was that much smart or just another brainless hoodlum, but it was too painfully obvious to come up with that just when some secret intelligencies started investigating in his plotting. Not only that but on realistic notes, the things he survived through would put him into the status of a superhuman, nobody can carry on a fist fight, holding on to a weightful adult body that's about to fall and more, and that's just after not only taking a beating but also after being stabbed at the shoulder repeatedly. If anything, he should have bled out until he went unconscious, but I guess you just got to pull some out of the world plot devices to steer down the action I guess.\r\nLeaving plot armor abuse aside. Some character really had a messed up sense of logic. Take Yut-Lung for example, going as far as cursing one's blood and at the same breath expresses how blood has nothing to do with anything.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nDespite a lot of disqualifications, this was a hell of a trip.\r\nSitting back on your couch and enjoying a show isn't that hard, especially with an action-packed entry such as this one, but ranting over the little things is one part of the enjoyment, at least for me.\r\nThere was a minimal annoyance for me when it came to homosexual references, but that was easily cooped up with, as I said, it really isn't about the character as they are easily substitutable.\r\nConcerning the relationship between Ash and Eiji, I don't really think there was anything implying that they were meant as a couple. I know I wouldn't want that, but it's not about what I want, they really were just best friends that contrasted each other, call it best buddies or bromance. Whatever suits ya.\n\n\r\nOverall (7.2/10):\r\nI should really raise the point of homophobic-ism, this show doesn't hold back on being somewhat of an extreme gay-ism, if you're not in good terms with that, you're better off not watching this show, as I've seen a lot of people get severely disappointed by that on different parts of the series, and end up dropping the show. But if you don't mind any of that, this would really make for an amazing ride, one that also doesn't care about your tiny fragile heart, and thus shows you the hell that Ash went through that you'd better be thankful you didn't. God be with all the people suffering from the same thing in real life. Have fun.\n"
