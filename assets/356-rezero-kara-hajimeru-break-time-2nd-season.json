The first 13 episodes revolve around re:Zero seasons 2 part 1, so it's better you watch it after that and even more criticalto stop at the 13th episode.\n\r\nThe 12 last episodes are mainly commenting on part 2 of season 2, some of them even unexpectedly explain critical plot points that were either left vague or undisclosed in the main season which I found as a weird and questionable direction call.\r\nI won't be missing this one in all honesty, don't look up to anything spectacular. Govern your expectations and buckle in.\n\r\nOverall: (4/10).\n"
