    "content": "\n                It seems that lately, most if not all (especially) crappy series trying to push a recap episode in the midst of being aired, probably as a call of desperate cash grab because they can't pull up a complete 12 episodes to seal the traditional seasonal mark. Or maybe it's one of those \u201cHere is where the series picks up, so you might as well recap what happened so far\u201d. But when you're presented with a trashy, lazy and extremely low-quality series, the last thing you'd want is more of the same garbage. That's one of my complaints as a completionist, I can't leave out thesmallest of related content to a series no matter how bad I hate it, it's both a curse (in this case) and a blessing on rare occasions.\n\r\n\u201cArifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou\u201d has managed to hype up a massive selection of the Isekai fans prior to its release, however, the disappointment was far greater than anyone had anticipated, and with this recap episode, you only get to see how much rushed and incomplete the storytelling was. So slow you could space out most of the episode, and suddenly, it jumps into being a fast-paced shitfest that requires more energy to follow up with than necessary.\n\r\nThe recap doesn't come up with anything new but a couple of teases for a new character at the end, however, you do get to see how much potential this story had, as they stripped off everything that was filling up the air time of each episode, leaving you only with the highlights. This series could have been at least decent, it turned out it carried more trouble than it was worth.\n"
