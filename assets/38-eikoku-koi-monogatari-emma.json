    "content": "\n                Sigh, Now, that's how you make a romance anime, I'm sick and tired of the crappy clich\u00e9 high school romance stories, this one is gold, It was painful to see them part ways, I literally loved the show, I don't know what took me so much to start watching this, It was on my 'To watch list' for ages now that it collected dirt,\n\r\n-Story 9/10\r\nAs simple as it sounds, a love story between two people from totally different social classes in a world where states matter the most, the story stayed true to itself all the way long, the comedy was on point and nottoo forced, and that's where most of the romance anime fail.\n\r\n-Art 8/10\r\nThe art style was weird at the beginning, but now I don't know if it was changed in these last episodes or I just got used to it,\n\r\n-Characters 9/10\r\nSo many good characters, and of course annoying little brats (VIVI), there are lots of variety of different people, like Stevens, for example, although he's (what most people would say) a side character, I didn't view him as such, he stood out to be a great character, one of my favourites, lots of character development happened to all our main and support characters, the back stories were as tragic as they come,\n\r\n-Music 10/10\r\nWow, just wow, never would have thought I'd ever enjoy Music from the Victorian era, appropriate music for it fitting scenes, the emotions were so true and relatable\n\r\nOverall, It's a golden solid 9/10, I'm curious what the second season has in store, I hope It stands out for an eligible sequel,\n"
