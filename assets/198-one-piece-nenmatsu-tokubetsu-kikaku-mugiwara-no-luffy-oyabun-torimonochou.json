    "content": "\n                I had a painful headache that started off from disputing how badly familiar this whole special was, I could have sworn that I have had seen it somewhere, on my first binge-watch, it was that Edo-period filler, but then again, there were multiple, and I have checked each one of them before proceeding into watching this, but still, it just was bugging me though, maybe because of how repetitive some of the goofs and plot threads are in One Piece.\n\r\nGiven how old the episode was, the animation still had a lot to showoff. I actually find the old quality line strokes to be aesthetically pleasing,almost deliberate, it had something about the old One Piece, kind of clunky, pointy, goofy, and nostalgic. I really like how the entirety of the crew blend in so easily with this drastic time period change, the number of references and cameos are insane, they reminded me of the recent Hungry Days commercials.\n"
