Well, I bet anyone should at least wash their faces after watching this movie because God does it lure you out of reality, no kidding, such a great movie, the music and the visuals, the excellent storytelling, it was more than enough to teleport me from my room to the story's world, the journey was so atmospheric and engaging, probably the best Ghibli film I've ever seen, and man it would be a great deal if Iwould ever watch and acknowledge another movie to top this one, and yes, I am one to not be satisfyied that easily, usually you would see me complain about the tiniest of things, but in this movie's case, I'm so about to explode expressing my satisfaction that I won't probably have time or energy to mention anything bad, but hey, this is a review, and stating the both is a must, let's get this overdone.\n\r\n- Story (9.5/10):\r\nOh, Wai-wai-wait, before you attack me, yes, this is a bit rude and poorly rated, I kept bragging about how the story was fantastic and marvelous, yes, I get it, but, it really still missed that half a point that it had at the beginning, think about it, I would have loved to see this as a series rather than it being a movie, with the approximately 2 hours length, it still felt short, and somewhat rushed on some parts of the story, there has been so much to be shown and told, but a movie has got a limited time to conlclude itself, and eventually it did, but hey, it still made it to 9.5 scores, that's something you don't see too much noadays, a well-structured story, pure and with no plot-holes is already a great thing to ask about, this is on the surface a story about innocent love, an adventure about facing your fears, and sacrificing everything for your loved ones, a story that teaches that beauty is not mandatory, and love doesn't rule by it, love is about something more, admiration comes from observing others, seeing in them qualities that we lack, that makes us utterly happy, looking a Howl, even though he has beauty, and can perform magic so magnificeantly, he was till empty, just an escapie fearing to face his past, his mistakes that he's long run from, and there came Sofie, a young girl that's not happy with how she looks and doesn't know a darn thing about magic, the two looked at eachother, they grew more closed, as Howl seen her as an old hag, and she saw him as a coward, they learnt from their mistakes and tought eachother that they can be something more, achieve greater happyness with eachother, and thus, the happy ending they craved about, was their reward, that was a short lookup on the sutface of the story, but that's not all that it was about, there were a lot of hidden so-called-side-stories contained within the main plot, like for example, the horror of war, the weakness of being old, the strong presence of social classes, and the weakness of the poor infront the might of the rich, how poor towns were attacked so oftn, and how rich parts of the country were a paradise in comparation, there was the family appoach that was presented in a very ironic way, where we see Sofie's real family acting all care-free, and all about money and status, which her made-up family shared her her happy moments, love and despare.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nOh yeas, written like a piece of cake, someone should contact the developers in this website, and tell them to add a higher rank for these special nominees, if there was an Oscar for this type of things, then hurry up, what are you waiting for, this 2004 movie that not only has better animation, art, and aesthetics than 90% of the current monthly spam of new franchises, it also sets a ceiling to other famous Ghibli films and work of arts, about 70% of the scenes that if paused, can make for incredible wallpaper material, the backgrounds and how they blend with eveything, the lighting, just oooh, I kind you not when I say, that this eye candy is so uplifting that it makes you wish you were there, present, feeling the wind gently tapping your skin, smelling the fresh flowers, interacting with the people in the background, it's truly a wonderland, and weirdly enough, that includes the scary places too, there is something very immersive with this Ghibli art, that I wouldn't have thought of anything more worthy of suiting such a rich story. What was really exciting to see, and even pause and stare at for few moments, those amazing landscapes, the oily looking streets, the food aesthetics, and most importantly, the mechanic structures, like for instance, Howl's castle, with its rusty parts and the strong Victorian age feel that sourrounds it, thouse simple shaky flying crafts, and the giant battleships, although looking very strange and out of this world, they really reflect what people were thinking about aircraft when they were first invented, you really can feel the environment and immerse with it.\n\r\n- Sound (10/10):\r\nDeserves every praise as the art, the soundtracks were very lively and engaging in their own way, sometimes they were quiet, other times, they were more strong and present that the visuals were, whenever there was a wholesome moment, it was escorted with the most fitting track you can hear, the dangerous moments were so emphasised by their respective sound effects, and don't get me started on how amazing the voice acting was, you can almost see the characters spitting their emotions while speaking, you could tell how impactful something was for them just by how vivid their voice sound, and no that's not all, there were those silent moments where them being so quiete made it even more impactful and solid, the way how they soundtracks where transitioned was handled amazingly, you can tell how talented the people who were behind this were.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nIt would have been even more perfect if it wasn't for the clich\u00e9 settings when it came to characters, it really reminds you of the old Disney characters, but in a unique another way, it felt more mature and grounded, like for instance, Sofie, being turned into an old woman, with her new weak body, she did keep her young rational personality, but her weak body had a strong role in containing her down, stopping her from doing crazy stuff, helped her feel more responsible, until we noticed that her personatily changed to match her grown body, let's talk about Howl's development, how he went from running to fighting, it was a long way from suffering from depression, but it sure paid off, and let's not overlook the initial villain figure, the witch hag, she at the end learnt her lesson the hard way, become more forgiving and sharing, it wasn't much at the beginign, but her burden help somehow strengthen the bonds of their family.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI, as someone who enjoyed works with more than just vague action, did find this two hours of animation amazing, one of the best movies I've seen, if not already the best, being the sucker for great animation and soundtracks, I had my share of satisfaction, being the type of guy who loved discovering the environment of the story, being engaged with the events, I sure did receive more than I was expecting.\n\r\n- Overall (9.7/10):\r\nI'm so ashamed to not give it a complete 10 out of 10, I sure will feel bad about it for the upcoming days, I would have never expected myself to be this much attached to the story, this was a great movie, no, a masterpiece even, and there isn't that much in the domain, would I recommend this? Absolutely and with no hesitation, for you all, romance, adventure, mystery fans, here's a hidden gem for you to enjoy.\n"
