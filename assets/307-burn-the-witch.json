    "content": "\n                Up until this point, Bleach had always had bad luck at adapting anything outside of its main TV series, the movies, the specials, everything just had to suck one way or the other, so when I heard of Burn The Witch, Kubo Tite's new One-Shot getting an animation short series, I had my doubts, and so, I help on the hype, I gave it time, and only decide to watch it recently, maybe, anything I was fearing would not come to pass. And man, did Kubo ever slapped me this hard since the early days of Bleach.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nI'm only going for what I saw onthese three episodes, because had it been a tad longer and more things were explore, this would have been an easy 8 if not more. These three episodes felt like the Romance Dawn arc of One Piece, it's super short, it has the spirit, but does not tell everything, no, no way near half of everything. You feel like setting the stone into a grand world build on top of Bleach's, but which entirely new and more expressive lore that followed everything thing. This felt like if Ghibli Studio were to animate a series instead of a movie more than not.\n\r\nArt (9.2/10):\r\nClose to perfection. The art style is there, the color palette, also there, the animation is dynamic and fluid, and the cinematography and camera angles were not of an average Anime screening. This was the best any of Kubo Tite's animate characters looked, and I hope it's a ten that will follow with the 1000 years blood arc of Bleach, Inshallah.\r\nThe characters felt really, really fresh and new, but also very familiar and nostalgic, I guess Kubo is one of the few Mangaka that persists his signature art even as he improves it. Also, more of a reminder that Kubo really did miss a promising future as a fashion designer because the clothing and customs here are a moo of their own.\n\r\nSound (8.3/10):\r\nI did not notice anything out of place, audibly speaking, the voice acting was sharp and great, the emotions were delivered, the passive-aggressive commentary was there and hit the comedic effect they aimed at, such a shame that no opening song came with this, but the ending was a great pleasurable treat.\r\nThe OSTs were good and felt organic and part of the scenes, however, not quite on Bleach's level, to say the least.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nObviously, we saw no character development \u201cthat mattered\u201d in these three episodes, but it's fine as the start of the story is yet to unfold.\r\nThe cast however is very varying and alive, with different characters with different interactions and charisma, never a dull moment of a boring conversation.\r\nThe main duo, Noelle and Nina was just the right nail to seal this story, both great in opposing ways, which keeps it interesting and fresh, with countless of Shounen that features males as the primary main characters, it's about time we saw things differently from a protagonistic female ^point of view.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nThree episodes were never going to be enough for this great showing. I certainly I not feel like I was gonna enjoy this this much, but I'm glad I did.\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nThat I better than was anticipating. Kudos to Kubo sensei for this new work, and looking forward to featuring sequels. An for you non-Bleach fans, this might still pull you in, even if you're not fans of Kubo's earlier works.\n"
