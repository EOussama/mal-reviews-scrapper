    "content": "\n                Probably the most disappointing modern adaptation to date, both Anime only watchers and Manga hardcore fans that claim the source material to be a masterpiece, all have turned their back on the abomination that one body could take for granted, \u201cTokyo Ghoul:re\u201d, with the prequel being just as controversially bad, this sequel of the same name told us to hold its beer, and that wasn't even half of the story.\r\nI'm an Anime-only watcher, I never read a single chapter of the Manga, and never was exposed to any of the \u201cspoilers\u201d you see being spammed on the internet.\r\nNevertheless, and given both recent adaptations, they remainone of the worse comebacks ever, at least in my experience.\n\r\nStory (3/10):\r\nJust like the prequel, and even more, the pacing was ridiculously fast, even my Manga reader sibling commented on how fast and confusing it was, let alone for Anime-only watcher normie me that had no idea on the chronological order of anything that happened in the season, literally, they go from one period of time worth of content to another with no alert, and it isn't a bad thing to do per se (Baccano! is a great example on how to accomplish that the right way), they themselves made it not work somehow.\r\nThe progression as well as poor and bad-received from my part, I was basically starting at the screen trying to figure out what was the meaning of what's happening, it felt more like a chore than actual entertainment.\r\nAside from the bad direction, the story, in general, fell by a great margin in terms of quality, and I can see the potential there, a lot of turn around moments and twists didn't have such impact, and most were forced and out of nowhere, like you'sd have episodes houses up to five or six big reveals, and none of them gives the other a moment of breather to tone down the intensity, no, it was more like a global traffic accident. Like, what is a Kagune anymore?\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nProbably the only decent aspect that \u201cTokyo Ghoul:re 2\u201d has going on other than the vocals.\r\nAnd even that wasn't for the most part, there are the big moments of shine that have a noticeable rise in quality, but almost the majority of animation was just a lazy bad move from their part, most talking about the distorted anatomy and the slow movements on scenes that were supposed to feel faster.\r\nI do give them one thing though, and that is the backgrounds, so realistic and do standout on their own and yet make a great job blending in the other not-too-realistic characters, and it works flawlessly.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nSee that eight? That's talking mostly about the opening theme song alone, Katharsis gave me a new aura to associate Tokyo Ghoul with. As much of an iconic Unravel was, I just can't help but give Katharsis the crown that Unravel held for so long, it just works perfectly, especially for a story with the same atmosphere as Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nThe voice acting, on the other hand, wasn't my proudest experience here, a lot of screaming was involved, and you know how bad that can get.\r\nToo bad they did not bring back some of the old soundtracks along, like the fantastic \u201cGlassy Sky\u201d. Just why did they think changing to something new would work better?\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\r\nA true shame, I do believe that Tokyo Ghoul had some of the greatest characters, that is until the \u201c:re\u201d adaptation joined the chat. There is particularly no sense in dealing with something called \u201ccharacter development\u201d in this shitfest of colliding misfits.\r\nIf anything, that was an intentional downgrade, the interesting Kaneki for instance, goes from his raging emo depression to a normie nerdy looking guy, to then out of the blue breaking the emo records once again, and all of that in the same episode, bruh, catch a breather, will ya?\r\nAgain, they went with the biggest weakness of the prequel and introduced a ton of other characters that we never got any background about, more specifically, think about it like crowd characters with names that they keep shaving up in your face the entire episode.\r\nThere were a lot of interesting backstories with huge potential, but they just didn't live up to my expectations, with the return of some characters we long thought were dead, and the death of many others, sense loses its meaning and you end up not giving any L's.\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\r\nBasically, when you're too into some Anime that you don't enjoy anymore, but still dedicate some time to watching it for the sake of completing it, and I'm a completionist as I like to call myself, if it sucks, I'll rant in the review.\r\nI did, however, experience one of my new favorite songs, Katharsis, that's probably the only good thing I'll remember about this adaptation, it really does feel bad, how such a big renowned series like this, gets such a low-level conclusion, even after a long time of wait from us fans.\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\r\nSo glad I went through this, and so sad at the same time for how bad it was. If you're already planning to watch this, chances are you made it through the first three seasons, and only this abomination is still standing between you and saying \u201cI watched Tokyo Ghoul\u201d.\r\nIt's adaptations like this that make you appreciate how great shows like \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d and \u201cMy Hero Academia\u201d have it, I'm not trying to steer any controversy here, if you like your Tokyo Ghoul, then nobody is stopping you from seeing this season, again, I'm just stating my opinion, and it's far from being a fact.\n"
