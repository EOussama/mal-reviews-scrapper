Probably, a weeby mentality like yours would almost strictly use this for its \u201cresearch\u201d department as a production tool of high value, but let's keep that argument low on notice.\r\nLet's keep everyone's kink out of this, and focus on a more pure intention, making the greatest Anime show out of the genres you enjoy, that's a winin sanity's book.\r\nJust like professor Utonium, open up the mixer, drop in a mesh of Mecha, adding some Ecchi, a few elements of hyper action won't hurt either, something of this and some of that and by a flicker of a switch, you get Kill la Kill. An urban alienated show filled with non-stop action and intense screaming, battle after battle almost every episode driving off a story of revenge and search of identity amid a global conflict between man and... clothing? Trust me, it doesn't stop there, this show is weird.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nBefore starting, let me confirm the weirdness I just spoke, you don't have to take the show seriously to enjoy it. Just go with the flow. So clothing is evil...\n\n\r\n...Pfff, this one is not going to be easy, would it? Let's just forget about clothing for now.\r\nRyuko, a loud and violent teenage girl that takes a questionably giant half-scissor-blade with her t-to school (What now?) and everywhere she goes, smothered in hate for the head of the student council of her school, Kiruin Satsuki, a snob high-and-mighty looking, tea-loving and swordmaster for what she believes that she was the one who killed her father, challenge after challenge she fights amount the remaining heads of the school's club until she hopefully earns her opportunity to fight Satsuki.\r\nThe story takes place in a post-dystopian, post-apocalyptic timeline was the poverty line is pushed to the extreme limits that your social life depends on the grades your kids get in their studies. And life was hard for Ryuko and her talkative friend, Mako, and her family.\r\nOf course, with a mad-max sitting like this one, you can't expect one to survive to bump mere fists, no, they have super clothing, and they rock might I add.\r\nRuko gets a black sailor's outfit that talks (?) and that of a free will, and he enemies are supplied with a strange line of clothing called the Goku outfits that are ranked from one start to three, the higher it gets, the stronger they are. Giving you super strength and speed as well as a Mecha screaming transformation.\r\nThe plotline twists on so many occasion, which only gets more satisfying and intense as it goes, hyping up characters and reveling new important faces.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nI still can't decide between Art or Sound perfection when talking Kill la Kill. Let's just say, they were crowned.\r\nThe show was released between 2013 and 2014, making it fairly old, but don't that lower your visual expectations for it, no, it stomps a good percentage of the modern dosses of seasonal Anime even now.\r\nNon-stop action requires a lot of frames, fluid translations, and storyboarding, and Kill la Kill did not disappoint in that department.\r\nThe character designs are crazy, sickly amazing and reflect on the direction of the show, very memorable in design and fun to look at even.\r\nI like that fights can span up to entire episodes and still suffer from minimal or even no drop in quality. There is a lot of impacts felt when blows are exchanged, you can feel the speed in the pacing of the animation, the anatomy can get super weird and whacky and so does the choreography, but Kill la Kill was never about realism, it's just fun and satisfying to watch a cartoony intense bloody fight between Animals.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nHere comes another star of the show, ever had an eargasm before? Then proceed with caution, this show might just take your ear-ginity.\r\nSeriously though, the soundtrack in this show is just phenomenal, and I'm specifically talking about the villain's OST, just perfect, it packs emotion, malice, arrogance, it just sounds so goodly evil, how on earth can they compose something so soundly good?\r\nThe openings and endings are matching the hype and goodness of the OST, both openings are to be remembered and the first ending was just so good, and when you hear it playing in the final episode, you just want to let ti go and let down some tears. Very powerful.\r\nThe voice acting was spot on, I especially loved Ryuko's voice, her edgy intense tone highlights the tom-boy part of her, man do I love it when she addresses \u201cKiryuin Satsuki\u201d with a voice that speaks anger and eagerness to fight. The rest of the cast was on part of the great quality of Ryuko's voice acting too.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nIt seems like even in the greatest shows, a solidly balanced cast of characters is always tricky and hard not to nit-pick on. Kill la Kill presents some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen, take for example Ryuko, a great protagonist that rarely pick up a nerve in you, the only thing I didn't like is her frequency emo-Esque phases that mostly ruin the already fun and good mood of certain moments.\r\nSatsuki in the other hand is amazingly written no matter the angle you're viewing her in. Great rival, solid character overall.\r\nMako is where it gets really mixed, there are people who love her, and people who just hate her gut, I seem to be okay with how she's written, she quibbles a lot, nags a lot, but most importantly, motivates and sticks up for Ryuko in all times, however, I still can't oversee her as a convenient plot device, especially in the earlier parts of the show where she's always a decoy to lure Ryuko into some trap.\r\nThe members of the Nudist Beach organization (Yes, that's a serious organization with a serious catch, it gets weirder) are all fun characters as well, and Mako's family just help lighten up the mood and tie up the Comedic effect of the show more.\r\nA very amazing character that makes her debut a bit later in the show is Ryago, an intense and sadistic antagonist that does so much good and nails every aspect that makes you both hate and love a villain, she has a great OST, the vicious voice acting and just enough abuse to deliver a solid villain in my opinion.\r\nThere was also this Nui girl that has a lot of fan following, but she didn't do it for me, so much for a crazy suicidal brat if anything.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI was not expecting anything of what I got back from Kill la Kill, if anything, it's a hilarious and fun journey to re-watch now and then, it just got everything you need to find a show enjoyable, probably the best asset in its disposable she the luck of taking itself seriously, I love it. The show reaches several climaxes with a great one just 3 episodes in, making it very easy to find your comfort zone with the show, if anything, I regret not watching in on its airing date where I would have been fanboying with the rest of the fandom every week, but it seems that the unfortunate amount of time that has passed ever since it finished airing, more people slept upon it, think it's just some weird  try-hard show.\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nKill la Kill might forever be one of the greatest classics from the 2010s, it's got a lot to praise, and very little to criticize. If you value fast-paced action, light-hearted comedy, and dramatic plot twists, it's just the show for you. But beware, it's just as weird as you might not give it credits for at first. And it only gets weirder from thereon. But weird isn't only bad, and bad is EA.\n"
