    "content": "\n                I almost started counting seconds to the second season release, but it seems that 2021 is yet to arrive, and then this recap dropped, then I thought, cool, it's a recap, but at least it's something. While a cool and condensed screening of everything that happened in the first season, it did contain some original animation at the end of the episode, and probably scenes from the second season which made it more hyped up for us on the waiting bench.\n\r\nLooking at this again, the animation is great, still missing the point from people criticizing it when it was still being aired, the OSTs areas amazing as I remember them to be too. Senku's confident voice is here as well with all of the rest of the cast. All in all, a decent recap that covers the real prize that is the last 3 minutes which gives you an idea of what they might be facing in the next season.\n"
