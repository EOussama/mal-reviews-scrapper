    "content": "\n                It\u2019s crazy how FLCL went from the forgotten dusted-up masterclass of a shoe to one with way too many half-baked spin-offs that do nothing but harm the public image of the franchise. To begin with, it\u2019s crazy enough to call it a franchise now. I guess you must sign along with me during this review.\n\r\nShoegaze is a sequel to the Alternative spin-off of the original 2000s show, specifically 10 years later, and unfortunately, just as disappointing and pale.\n\r\nIf guess, the first criticism any other sequel gets is that it diverts away from the premise of the previous installment and dulls everything out if not mostif it, however, to Shoegaze\u2019s defense, it kept up with the disappointment that was Alternative, and even added zero flavoring on top of it, it\u2019s like the makers said: \u201cwe here you, here\u2019s more of what we gave you\u201d.\n\r\nIt feels like a missed opportunity for Shoegaze to not capitalize on the \u201ccoming of age\u201d plot line that FLCL and its disappointing spin-offs always aimed for, but instead, did a half-half approach with a minimal teenage focus and an adult focus, both diverging in a literal pot of doo-doo.\n\r\nIf I did not love the original FLCL show I wouldn\u2019t have been as passionate in my hating towards Shoegaze, but to be honest, you gotta vent sometimes.\n\r\nOverall: 5.18/10.\n"
