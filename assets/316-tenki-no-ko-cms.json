    "content": "\n                Name a better duo, Makoto Shinkai movies, and mineral water commercials. At this point you'd think they bottle people's tears caused by the movies in question and put them up for sale, there has got to be a co-relation with this, one before with 5 centimeters per second and Your Name, and again with Weathering With You.\n\r\nThere is a huge collection of related commercials for this big-budget movie, the reuse of the same vers from the main theme can grow stale and repetitive, the two main characters used as the mascots here, for a movie with a huge name to it, it was rather uncreativeand low-effort for a commercial.\n"
