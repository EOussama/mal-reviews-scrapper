    "content": "\n                It doesn't get any weirder, and I guess the picture of the OVA is enough to justify that. There have been a lot of weird try hards OVA on the lifetime of the Naruto franchise, but never to this degree.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nGiven the nature of the OVA, they put a lot into the visual production, at some instance, even more so than the parent show. However, the abomination was released once the background was out of focus, at first glance, you do appreciate the fines and the quality of the art, but just wait until the camera zooms out a bit, and it all becomeseye piercing.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nDecent voice acting, but more importantly, the killer soundtracks really helped raise the suspense of the raging moments.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI had a vivid idea of what I was getting myself into, but I never imagined it to be to this degree. I literally the top of clumsiness as far as the tone of the Naruto story goes. A certain character is there, doing something they would never do, at some timeline or probably a Genjutsu-level dream.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nIs it worth it? Totally, It's only 11 minutes and it offers something really odd by new to the table. Not top of the comedy to be honest, but the sight of randomness totally sells it.\n"
