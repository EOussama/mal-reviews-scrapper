Bleach is one of if not the only one that comes to mind when envisioning a good selection of soundtracks.\n\r\nThis special episode is the first Bleach OVA that debuted as a feature in Jump Fest 2004, it's an alternative version of the Memories in Rain mini-arc from the Anime and Manga series, I don't recognize any striking differences from broth versions, it's a good standalone arc that presents Ichigo as a character and highlights his defects and strengths.\n              "
