Not even the fandom, it leaked into other fandoms with so many discussions, cosplays, fan art and so much more, but can you really point fingers and question its legitimacy after you give the episode a watch yourself? It was objectively a rare product of talented people and great management that every animation project should strive for. It generated hype, it advertised for the source material, and it built up a massive fandom overnight, but then, the rest of the show aired, and it was \u2026let\u2019s just say, the first episode should have remained a standalone.\n\r\nFollowing its success, a second season was announced, hype was rejuvenated, and of course, after the series has finished airing, you see a lot of conflicting opinions about the season, and the franchise as a whole, now that a clearer picture of the plot has been painted.\n\r\nWithout going into spoilers, I myself felt that the plot for 80% of the second season deviated greatly from the advertised main plot that was alluded to, it\u2019s like watching a stream of Skyrim, but instead of the main quest, the streamer would grind through hundreds of hours of side quests that amount to nothing, a very high-risk low award situation, sure, we\u2019re doing it for clues to help us unravel the main mystery that drove episode one of the first season but man, does it become old after a couple of episodes.\n\r\nNot to say that the show fell off completely off its metal, there were many peak moments of immense build-up and perfect delivery, but it surely was a grueling way to get there, and even so, the reward did not justify the journey, at least in my eyes.\n\r\nThe second season keeps up the amazing quality, be it animation, character acting, voice acting, or directing, the entire package feels like a premium screening of a once of a lifetime performance, which really eases out the slower parts of the show. It is pretty to look at and hear at least.\n\r\nI really praise the character development displayed here, even more than that of the first season, so many characters were introduced and each one of them felt like they had their moment, they were actual people tangled in the plot instead of NPCs that initiate conversations and give monotone responses.\n\r\nI feel like after watching the last season, this one is the natural move to pursue, although I would give you a side-eye warning, you may be bored to your bones, but surely, the few but great payoff moments we get might just be enough to justify that for you.\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10.\n"
