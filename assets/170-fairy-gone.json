But Fairy Gone overwrote that kind of feeling for me by giving me a life-long implication for what to come. It was partly my fault, but Anime itself was no innocent angel either.\r\nOriginally planned to span 24 episodes, it was later announced that it was going to be a split courof 2 parts, I don't know if that was the right thing to do to save a doomed adaptation like this, but it could go either way. Giving you a breather between the two parts to only torture you back again might be some of the evilest things ever, but it could also turn out to be a change for the better, exactly the kind of change I'm hopeful for.\n\r\n- Story (3.5/10):\r\nCalling it a story would be a stupid kind of a stretch. I could not for the love of God grasp anything. Too many locations, too many dates, lots of names dropping on us all the time, remember when watching an Anime was about having fun? It felt like a painful chore in this show's case.\r\nThe show really had great potential, and it's easily apparent by just ready the initial synopsis, if anything, it was a matter of bad direction. Way to underestimate what bad pacing can do to the flow of the story. Every event starts off by kicking fast pace action composed of random shots of many characters, each doing their thing, but then, and with no prior notice, you find yourself listening to the narrator telling you how it ended in an annoying third person pov, almost spoonfeeding you the story the way they want you to, the worst type of gatekeeping.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nUndoubtedly, the only good thing going for this God forsaken adaptation. But at what price? I guess that what happens when you have way too much budget dedicated to a single department.\r\nTo say the least, Fairy Gone still retained a status of what a modern Anime should be like, visually at least, but lacked every other rule of thumb that makes an actual Anime worthy of one's time.\r\nThe character designs and the background and how both blend so well were definitely the stars of the show. The cast of characters looks like a group of first-class models, very pleasing to the eye at least. The background feels lively and very well blended into the scenes. It could have been easily the best-animated show of the season with a great deal of consistency between the episodes, however, the horror of horrifying CG struck like there was no tomorrow. The Fairies, the thing that made ready the synopsis hype the show for me looked like true nightmares. CG can be bad, but this? They better re-think their choices for the second cour of the series.\r\nThe high paced fight scenes that made most of the latter part of the series were on a standpoint of production, very good. But something that reeks of negativity rendered every effort put on them useless. They pretty much felt like though shitty AMV compilations you see so often on Youtube. Cool characters exchanging blows while a party banger of a song is playing on top with an out of sync volume. It just didn't feel right.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nGood enough to keep up with the great visuals, average voice acting, and good opening and ending theme songs. Those both definitely found a decent following in between the fans.\r\nThe soundtracks were lively, nothing revolutionary thought.\n\r\n-  Character (2/10):\r\nJust how bad could this have been?\r\nYou would think that at least one character out of the mass would strike the cool-dude/cool-girl vibes, and in terms of character designs, they definitely did. But God were they some of the most one-dimensional characters ever. No character development whatsoever throughout the serialization, at least, none that matter. The protagonist set off for a goal at first, 3 episodes later, they abandoned what they set off for altogether and never tackle it again.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nIt felt more or less like a grid to me. Just like when you boot up a game in your steam library just so it doesn't remain unplayed, I really had high hopes for this show, it turned out I should be more careful doing research before I dedicate valuable time to a series.\n\r\n- Overall (5.4/10):\r\nLong story short, just stay away from this. At least for now, until a better cour is released, you don't want to grind through both cours with a down expression on your face, unless you really hate yourself that much.\n"
