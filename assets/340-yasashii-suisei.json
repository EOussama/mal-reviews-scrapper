Watching this music video, especially with context, and aside from YAOSOBI's wonderful vocalization, it reached the height that Beastars, the TV series, could never reach, but was always after.\n\r\nFrom the first second to the last, taking into account the unique, chalk-like style, to the euphoric melodic rhythm of the song, it tingled me in a place I could never expect from something so short and deliberate like this music video. The sheer amount of emotion portrayed by both characters, Ibuki and Rouis as they take their ride to despair,felt like a fever dream from Rouis's perspective as he reminisces about the night he lost an almost father figure, better than his biological one, and also, his adoptive one.\n\r\nThis one tends to defer from the show by exposing the brutality and betrayal of the moment at hand under different light, as the show tends to execute the event in a dark, quiet tunnel, while this music video fully displays the characters over colorful backgrounds, bold line strokes and shaky edges, not shying from the brutal send-off of Ibuki, and Rouis last cry for a second chance.\n"
