The first one's biggest problem was that.. well, it existed, I guess we better be ready for more of them, but with this one,I felt a sort of the change in heart.\r\nThe character choice, for instance, Betelgeuse was sarcastically a good match for the role, he kept being in character, the commentary was fair, the rage was on point and the snap at the end was also great.\n\r\nThe illustrations were cute, if you never knew you needed Baetrice blasting enemies and Subaru with a Quad missile launcher then you're at luck,watch this for that sake alone, it also helps immensely that it's under 3 minutes long.\n"
