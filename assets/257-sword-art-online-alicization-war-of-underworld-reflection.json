No, Alicization was a blast.\r\nFor a season that has given us a full-blown, well put together recap around episode 18, it seems that chronologically at least; 5 to 6 episodes later it will present yet another recap. A bit overkill, but watching it on the release date makes more sense.\n\r\nIn terms of a recap, 18.5 was definitely more well-motivated and properly placed on a narrative note, while this one is more of a hype-up moment for War of Underworld.\n\r\nThe recap is split into two parts, the first one focuses on Asuna and her outside perspective on the whole dilemma, while the secondpart is more about what was happening in the final battle hasn't Quinella. I really liked he first part, maybe because 18.5 (which is still fresh on my mind) already expanded on whatever happened in the underworld, so the whole scientific side of the season felt more appealing, it was great to rewatch how the series makes sense of Fluctlights and its applications.\n\r\nThe recap swiftly ends on the same cliffhanger note from before, really setting up the stage go a great spectacle.\n"
