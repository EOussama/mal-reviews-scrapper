My Hero will always be a good show, but the desperate hateful eyes will never shut up about comparing it to this and that.\n\r\nI believe the franchise needs no introduction, with 5 seasons (6ths in the works) and three movies to its name as of writing this review, its fame haswell been planted and solidified, a popular show like this can't be bad, right? right? With that aside, we're here for the movie, not the label at hand, so buckle up for the read.\n\r\nIt was a surprise to nobody that a show of this magnitude received a movie in early 2019, but as the majority agrees, it left a lot of being desired. Some months later, in the same year, the second movie was released, so no doubt of the latter's success, and Oh boy did they learn from their past mistakes.\n\r\nI felt like this movie had everything the previous one lacked, rivalry fan service. This felt more like the second Naruto Shippuden movie (Bonds) that was focused on both Sasuke and Naruto, where this one, respectively, Bakugo and Midoriya were the highlights. Let's forgive the fact that this was a filler movie, so nothing that happened should be bound by cannon constraints, and I'm talking specifically about the ending portion of the movie which I will not spoil for anyone.\r\nMore than any other episode, this movie felt like an appreciation letter for the Deku/Bakugo rivalry fans, it does so well by that premise leaving you wanting Bakugo to really get there in his relationship with Deku in the canon material.\r\nAnother great display of characters was the villain group, albeit, I do not agree with the popular take that goes it was better than the league of villains, the villain group at hand did what it was set up to do, it presented a hopeless challenge to class 1-A, it raised the stakes too high degrees of desperation and despair, and most of all led to the cooperation of Bakugo vs Deku and the jaw-dropping final showdown.\n\r\nSpeaking of jaw-dropping, the animation was really going that hard, every fight scene was handled with care and delicacy no matter how insignificant it was, fluid cartography, weighing impacts, and organic movements. Also, I couldn't help but notice the extra vibrancy that dwelled in the color pallet, this movie felt and looked colorful.\r\nAs always, MHA knows its musical sheets, every intense moment was met with an even more intense musical score and I'm talking specifically about the final showdown, it was a really interesting choice on their part.\n\r\nI'm not the biggest My Hero fan, to no extent, really, but this movie hit me differently, I tend to fall asleep late at night while I'm watching... anything, but not this time.\n"
