A weird title that translates to \u201cO Maidens in Your Savage Season\u201d, a title that exposes way too much about its show, weirding out the savageness it has from the get-go, throwing it at you savagely becauseyou won't say no. That last part made no sense, but so did the show at hand, let me elaborate.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nIt's unfortunate how fast this hidden gem has turned from 0 to a 100 in a negative way, while it holds a semi-original plot that you don't see every season. A dramatic slice of life with some rom-com aspects to it that revolves around confused highschool students, you know that's always an entertaining play. Most similar shows would put you on a 3rth party perspective following a male protagonist, or several of them struggling with this savage and scary phase called teenage years. However, unlike most of those show that follows this common trope, the main cast is composed of female characters, excessively obsessed with sex, or what they like to call it, \u201cess-e-ckess\u201d, or something similar to that, deforming that word of coursed accomplished nothing, but create more drama, and that's how the show sparkles, creating uncomfortably embarrassing moments between already easily embarrassed individuals with only makes for great gags. That, in a nutshell, is what you get from the first episode onwards, but oh boy, if only they followed on the same train, things would have been a little better than they ended up being.\r\nAlmost mid-way, the show makes a complete turn into a dark and unexpected corridor, betrayal, treason, and most of all, PEDOPHILIA. and I gotta say, the show was at least brave enough to put and discuss this sensitive topic on a mainstream medium, it was of course very wrong to look up some times, but it served a purpose to enrich the relationships between the characters, that is, if the story took itself way more seriously, instead, I ended up looking at another mess that brought me a handful of unwanted \u201cKuzu no Honkai\u201d vibes. I did not enjoy that as much as I would want to say out loud.\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nOn a visual note, this show about savage maidens was the sweet spot for me this season, you've got all sorts of rivaling shows airting at the same time, each proclaiming a unique art style to them, leaving the more neutral go to this show.\r\nTo sum it up, it's like putting a flashy Instagram filter on top of your generic-looking slice of life. The colors have a special dim to them, very faint and barely monochromic, but still retain so much color into them.\r\nThe character designs were, well, generic, but it makes no problem whatsoever, as the visuals are only there to present the story, and they do their job flawlessly.\r\nThe backgrounds are, mild! boring to look at, mere containers for the characters to take their highlights on. Definitely, not the strongest point of the Anime.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nWHACK, Nah, I just felt like saying that, out of context, for the folks that like to skip through review paragraphs? here, have some \ud83c\udf68.\r\nI think this is what made for the most enjoyment I got from the show. It is very hard to put in so much, feelings, so much confusion and so much desperation into a lost teenager that always though the world is centered around them, and are just realizing otherwise, you could actually almost physically feel it. It is undeniable one of the best vocally produced Anime shows of the season, so much talent.\r\nThe opening and ending songs were so good, hearing them playing at the last moments of the last episode put you into a dearing mind, I'm totally going to miss this show.\n\r\nCharacters (6.5/10):\r\nThe wide group of protagonists and the short serialization of the show were probably one of its biggest weaknesses. You never have enough time to properly flesh out every character, and so as a result, you find the show alternating between multiple characters almost in a chaotic way. Too many relationships at stake, way too many variables, a character would claim something, only to revoke it an episode later, you'd think a character is developing a certain way but end up on an entirely different side of annoying. I've seen confused teenagers, but these folks were just poorly directed. And again, I blame it on the short length of the show, because they do have a lot to flesh out, they just don't get enough screen time to do so.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.3/10):\r\nJust like any other show, trash it was or a masterpiece, they always have some way to still being entertaining. The show is very dramatically exaggerated, full of clich\u00e9 tropes, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable, it's a genius sit full of laughs, drama, and sometimes, disappointments. The characters act like teenagers, the horrify you just like one, and in some instances, their stupid decision can even reflect on your past mistakes. Just like its name, it does reflect on that SAVAGE time period. In a save way nonetheless.\n\r\nOverall (7.36/10):\r\nI got into the show expecting a comedy heavy highschool centered slice of life, turned out I was slapped on my face by excessive drama as if the show was trying to deliberately get rid of the funny side of it and force out \u201cplot twists\u201d at the end of every episode. It helps to know what you're getting into first, it definitely not a tear-jerker, but the controversies it pushes are quite ... sudden. Just so it doesn't jump-scare you into quitting, there is some aspect of pedophilia criticized here with only scratches on the question, should controversy be encouraged or censored? Well, the show knew what it was getting into, so despite that, there were some restraints that kept it from crossing the line.\n"
