I don't hate the show, but I also don't put in any effort trying to fan up and follow every news and announcement related to it. Despite the giant fuss people made over the first season, I never felt any sort of resonance from the show, except for maybe the last 5 minutes from episode 19. But you, you already heard too much about that episode alone.\n\r\nWhen this movie was announced, I did not have any expectations nor did I bother formulatingone. It was going to be just another Demon Slayer hill roll, or so I thought, so I put it back until an unnamed day.\n\r\nFast forward a long while later, and after refusing to watch it at a cinema with friends, I finally was forced to check it out out of boredom, and oh boy, did that hurt.\n\r\nThe train arc adapted by this movie was the most definitive Demon Slayer experience that I always feel left out of, perhaps it's not the arc perse, but the movie formula that really complimented its run. Trimming all unnecessary screening and compacting the important tidbits, it's what really pinned me down in my place, almost cramping my leg on multiple occasions of how much intensity carried throughout the movie.\n\r\nPicking up right after the first season left, almost like the start of a Modern Warfare campaign, straight to the action, no time wasted in too much recapping. It felt like a microcosm of the entire season one, get into a location, gets to know the key characters, struggles against an enemy, have a character growth moment, and leave off on a high note. Amazing.\n\r\nMy favorite aspect about this entire movie, and what contributed the most to my enjoyment is the character highlight of Rengoku. The first season ended on a really breathy moment, right after introducing us to the massive cast of new characters known as Hashirah, this movie went from knowing nothing about any of them to the point of not caring, to genuinely rooting for Rengoku, even more so than Tanjiro or anybody else in the show.\n\r\nRengoku, this larger-than-life character, felt like an over-exaggerated, more accomplished version of Tanjiro, both ideologically and physically, with a great backstory and strong motive to do what he does.\n\r\nIf you thought the 2 minutes of good animation at the end of episode 19 was masterful, get a load of this 2 hours long version of the same thing. Everything from line art that breaks into the characters' emotions to the beyond the fluid\r\nmovement of every muscle wrap or strand of cloth. The elemental effects from the show are present here, only much more perfected and better cinematographer.\n\r\nThe music too was something that really had me wish I experienced the movie on a cinema, alone, blessed by every decibel of that orchestral greatness. The OST really carried a lot of emotional weight that's at the same time, presented in an unbelievably euphorical voice acting line up.\n\r\nThis is a movie you wish you saw over and over again, one of those picks that you'd show a non Anime watching person in hopes of introducing them to Anime in general, it was that good.\n"
