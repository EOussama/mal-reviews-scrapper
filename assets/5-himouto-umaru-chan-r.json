    "content": "\n                How the days go fast indeed, not only in the show, where 12 episodes cover a whole year,s but only in real world, where 12 episodes felt like a lightning flash, something about this show that really distinguished is from any other, even the first season feels like a stranger in comparison, your favorite references are still present, the wholesome jokes is as lively as ever too, but what's the real new thing is \u201cactual plot\u201d, not going to lie, the first season, was so vague, pointless stuff occurring in a typical slice of life comedy anime, but this one has a strange addition, youcan really feel a progression in the story, the characters are doing something for once, they are developing as times goes by.\n\r\n- Story (7.8/10):\r\n12 episodes that follow the life of a slacker, Umaru-chan, the perfect girl in the eyes of many along with her brother Taihei, while interacting like they siblings they are, they make some changes to the people surrounding them, they influence them to improve, to change their personalities, and enhance their treats, like for example with the shy unpopular Ebina, who gains confidence, and the lonely Kirie-chan who wins friends she can depend on, from time to time, there are those little glimpses of few character's flashbacks that really help clear things out, and desyphers the way they are. It's really satisfying how they dug up their past, only to make them seem connected somehow.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nI haven't noticed any differences between this animation, and that of the first season, both are great and colorful, very lively and wholesome, ever wondered how could a drawing be wholesome? Here it is, how the characters are drawn, how the backgrounds blend so well with the atmosphere and everything, something that this anime does so well, is the representation of food, yes you heard me right, food looks so much more appealing in anime and manga, but in this particular show, it's done so well that it makes you believe it was done by purpose, and that's just one example.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI can't think of a better fitting score for this, just like the first season, the same wholesome tracks play all the time, nothing new, or at least that's what I think, I really like the opening, it was one of those openings that are really odd and unlikable at the beginning,but I really grew to love it, and the same can be said about the ending song.\n\r\n- Character (7.8/10):\r\nYour same old characters, but less annoying (yes, looking at you Sylphinford freaking Tachibana), and more likable, like Kirie-chan, what really helped raise the quality of the characters is the way they developed into the best, Bomber and Alex got some more screentime, and so did Kanau, I thought that was great, there were few other characters introduced, like family members, some of them were really interesting, but some of them were just not welcomed, of at least that's how I felt when I first saw Hikari.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nOne might argue that this anime is just a waste of your precious time, a waste of resources and energy, it has no story for it, nothing at all, BUT, this second season, looked much more dynamic, it felt like the studio learned from their mistakes, and improved upon them, I really enjoyed every bit of this anime.\n\r\n- Overall (8.02/10):\r\nYes, the decimal precision matters in the score.\r\nWould I recommend this anime? It certainly is not for everyone, most the people who watched enough anime, read enough manga would grasp those little hints and references about other works, it true comedy in the show for me, lays there.\n"
