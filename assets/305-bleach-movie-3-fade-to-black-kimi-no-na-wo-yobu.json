    "content": "\n                Bleach has set up a disappointing trend within itself, where everything outside of the tv show released is just blunt and boring compared to what the main tv series offers, although, the boost in animation is always there and noticeable, it's never enough to uplift the dead inside plot.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nI don't know what's wrong with Bleach and its oversaturated rescue plotlines, you're not a main character unless your name is Ichigo or you're been abducted at least 3 times, it gets repetitive, echo-y, and predictable.\r\nThe plot of the third movie is significantly better than the previous two movies, however, it's still not quite there yet.\n\r\nArt(8.5/10):\r\nThe team behind Bleach always knows who to pull off state-of-the-art animated fights, especially when as big of a budget is being thrown, it never goes to waste, and it shows.\r\nThe color palettes always stick the most, creative use of blacks and variations of shades that really sell the dark and obscure theme of Bleach.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nIt's no new news that Bleach had always had memorable OSTs and a talented voice-acting cast of both languages (Japanese and English), and this movie is just yet another seal in its favor.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nI'm not gonna go over the same cast again, so I'm only speaking for the new faces that make up the villains of this movie.\r\nThey feel like filler characters that were pulled up from someone's old notes of an unaired cheap filler episode, very forgettable and uninteresting.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.3//10):\r\nI wish things were the other way around, but lately, Bleach has been missing a lot of points. And as a fan, it kinda hurts.\r\nThere were a lot of gaps throughout the film where I totally lost attention o the things happening as every 5 minutes I would gloss over a freaky flashback of some other Bleach filler that had some similarities of what's going on that it stopped being enjoyable before it even unfolded.\n\r\nOverall (7.26/10):\r\nWith one movie left to go, it's both sad and happy for me, for once, I get to finally set my Bleach journey to an end (at least until the Anime returns) and happy in the sense that I'm gonna finally take a break from this massive burnout I got during my binge-watch.\n"
