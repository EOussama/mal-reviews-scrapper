However, the conclusion was dismissed on a very weird note, as that of having the main character still not coped up with what drove his life around, which ended up having him help out others, but neglecting himself and his own struggle. Maybe helping out the other was the struggle ofhis own, or maybe, part of it, as he sorts shit on other's life, slowly, but surely, his own shit is unfolded, strap by strap, like an inter-connect riddle that leads to his own salvation. That is the stance this movie had, as the definitive conclusion of what the parent show was running after, perhaps it was for the better to isolate it away from the other \u201cbuild-up\u201d series, or perhaps it is the reason so many fans of the show won't end up watching the movie and thus sleeping on THE true book closing end of the story. And yes, I understand that the source material is still serializing, so thus far, we have only seen a snapshot of something much bigger animated, but nonetheless, the strong relation this movie has with the prequel series is something that truly takes away from an experience that while stands solidly on its own feet, could do much more having it bundled with this movie.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nThe original TV series started something very unique, very fresh and worthy of the popularity it had going for it. A classic romance story with a mystery ingredient with strong supernatural elements that have it steering the drama wheel. It revolved around several related short arcs that at the greater picture, were a mere buildup to this climactic impelling movie, a turn of events that satisfyingly puts down the writer's pen to rest on a great note.\r\nI would be lying if I called it a masterpiece, there were definitely some things that did not turn the tongue properly, but it was far from being a bad adaptation. Basically, a saga ending story arc that deals with Sakuta primarily, and the mysterious young girl from his past, Shouko.\r\nSealing my fingers from typing any major spoilers, I would say that the story went down the hill, a route I never wanted it to approached, but it still embraced it, cheaply overpassing its great struggle yet, from an outcome that would have rather ended up being depressingly sad, but would have still made more sense than the climax-canceling trump-card known as ..., well, I'll let you find that by yourself.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nThis franchise was never the \u201ceye-flaming\u201d one, where one praises the fidelity of animation before anything else. In fact, while the art style can tell it appears from a huge array of similar shows, it was never the point or direction behind this adaptation to steer a visual emotion on the viewers, no, but it was merely a complement to the story, one that's good enough to make you watch and unbothered by the mediocre visuals that it could have ended up having. I can't say that this movie did anything with that that makes the parent TV show fail to compare would be a special type of stretch. The character design is appealing enough, the background seems to match the atmosphere the story is trying to deliver, and that's about it.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nI love my Seiyuus, and this franchise has secured its place for me during the first few lines I got to hear. A show heavy on emotions naturally leans to the more experienced, dramatically talented cast of Seiyuus, and it was a marvelous introduction to even some of the new names that have left an impression big enough on me that I'm considering other series they voiced at.\r\nAside from the voice acting, the OST that fills the silence is also spot on. I would have loved to praise the hell out of the original opening and ending, but we got to heard remixes of them, well blent, almost sneaked in between some other OSTs.\n\r\nCharacters (8.2/10):\r\nArguably, one of the strongest points that the series has going for it, is how likable, and easy to relate to of a cast of characters. Koga, the chick that introduced herself in a butt-kicking exchange, or the bunny girl inducing Mai, Futaba, the pretty nerdy girl that needs every excuse to link quantum-anything to the subject of matter, and of course, the precious, needy of protection, Kaede. And that's just to name a few.\r\nSeeing, or even hearing any of the characters after such a long time brought so much nostalgia and joy that made itself aggressively visible when I was probably too focused on following what's going on the screen to realize. Just when you think you've known and dissected what the main characters are like from watching the parent show, this movie goes even deeper, showing new sides of the same characters, putting them under pressure and seeing how they overcome the situation, talking specifically about Sakuta, Mai, and the most mysterious figure from the parent show yet; Shoko, and what a reveal the series was building up for her.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nIt was both shocking and expected from me, looking back at the parent show that I had watched when it was first being aired, which also was my first seasonal binge watch that I'm still to this day trying to keep up with, so earlier series are always going to be fresh on the mind, however, seeing as it was a fall series from late 2018, that long already? I wonder what made me come back week after week when I was first watching the show, and from only the introductory scene, I was reinformed of what makes this series what it is, what sets it up from every other seasonal bootleg, sorry excuse for a light-novel adaptation, and what makes it so memorable.\r\nFrom the first second to the last, the tension was rising, the feels were manifesting, the characters made you feel their struggle, and everything that happened in the parent show proved to be more relevant and way more important than they first seemed to be, as they splendidly related to this climax, serving as the conclusive build up all along.\n\r\nOverall (8.24/10):\r\n\u201cSeishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai\u201d was one of those short sequels, shrequels, if you will, that made a fantastic tale into something even more spectacular, it adds in the topping to the juice-ngly delicious cake, a cake that's, unfortunately, nobody pays enough attention to, and as a result, end up passing up on a decision changing hidden side of story that links every bit together.\n"
