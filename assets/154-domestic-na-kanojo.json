With its heavy incestuous plotpoints that know no border, it doesn't hold back on provoking that Taboo of a relationship which only a true descendant from Alamaba can relate to.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nIf there was anything this show excels at, it's the art of distraction. If we pulled all the chords, there is really no deep backstory that changes everything in the last moment or anything of that caliber, I would argue that Calliou had a more interesting plot line if we were honest, but \u201cDomestic na Kanojo\u201d is self-aware of that and unlike all other shitty adaptations, it acts against it by pushing it extra hard with the incest, that one taboo that's still not well expressed upon on mainstream media, and you know our inner selves enjoys these moral-provoking direction that pinches at a place we're not all too familiar with.\r\nI'm no expert in cooking nor do I have the slightest experience needed to pass as a taste analysis, but I can point out a spicy plot when I lay my eyes on one. Yes, we're talking about a dude that walks in on his sister A while masturbating to only go make out with sister B not even 5 minutes after.\r\nIt's the fast and unpredictable pacing that makes it work despite the many flaws it has, you can start off an episode all heartwarming and heavily wholesome with all sorts of sweet family friendly content, \u201cOh, brother, can you get me that glass of water - Sister A\u201d, \u201cof course - The brother\u201d and then they would go for hours bringing up fun memories from their childhood and oh boy does it transform very fast to a dedicated sex scene right after they get off the dining table.\r\nDespite the controversial references it packs, the show definitely knows how to steer it from a lighthearted sitcom to a dark love hexagon (If you will) that mocks a lot of serious social crises like taboo relationships, forbidden love, and suicide.\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\r\nArt style wise, it's really good, but animation wise, it's average at best.\r\nThe movements of the characters are very trippy and unmatching for such a fast-paced show like this one, but I guess their intention was to create something that's not very expensive whilst fulfilling the massive still shots of their shocked faces that just happen to occur at least 10 times an episode, you really can't criticize those Indian dramas without bashing on this show first for a reason.\r\nI really like the general art style of the show, notably more visible on character designs, the way they draw their faces and expressions, their anatomy at different camera angles, I adore that. Sometimes though, the proportions can be a little bit off and can really do a number of the overall visual quality.\r\nThere was a specific aspect of the art I really liked and would love to see in more other shows is that strange color displacement effect they dd on some of the scenes to enhance them visually and add special highlights on the characters.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe sound acting was... decent, I can't remember any moment that made me go \u201cdamn, that's performance gave me chills\u201d, it was just about enough to carry on the spiced up clich\u00e9 moments.\r\nOn the other hand, the opening song, without a doubt the best one this season, I could even argue that it has the potential to be the best opening of the year, but that's only going to be confirmed once 2019 is past us.\r\nMost fans compared it to Unravel, the popular song from the opening of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, some even called it Unravel 2.0 which I can sort of agree, it does give off almost the same vibes, the lyrics are just as strong and relatable to the story itself.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nAn interesting character rooster is what this show lacked the most. Talking about their treats and characteristics, I can name at least about enough other shows that had identical characters to fill out an A4 paper.\r\nNatsuo, in particular, was a horribly written character that makes you instantly not like it despite being the protagonist that you're supposed to cheer up, an unbelievable rational teenager that wants it all to be his way and decides to skip on all opportunities of character development he got.\r\nNow moving to the more controversial group of characters, the female acquaintances, it got so serious that it split up the fandom into four groups, for each their idolized waifu. On that note, I can definitely see why they were that popular as characters and I won't hide the fact that even I rode along their hype, speaking as one of the Miu team.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.7/10):\r\n\u201cDomestic na Kanojo\u201d was something I only decided to watch so that I can keep my watching list of the season dividable by two, and I so happened to stumble across this marvelous guilty pleasure series (Which I kind of found it like that) that fed me up from its spiciness and kept me asking for more every week, even though it falls short on quality when it's compared to its higher pairs of the season, it differently provided me with more enjoyment than most of them.\n\r\nOverall (7.6/10):\r\nIt's hard to say if it's a recommendation-worthy show without stretching it any further, it differently has its charm, that I can give you, however, a lot f people expect every show to have a deeper meaning behind it and end up missing on a lot of good series that aren't precisely that concerned on carrying out a reality series but do make up for the enjoyment you get from it.\r\nI at least know what other show is worthy of a rewatch along others, a lot of fans of the source material trash the show as much as they can, however, I do appreciate what it offered even if it was mocked to hell.\n"
