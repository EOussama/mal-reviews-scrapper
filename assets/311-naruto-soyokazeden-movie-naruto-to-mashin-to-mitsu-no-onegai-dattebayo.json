    "content": "\n                Specials come in all shapes and forces, but definitely not in form of movies. Correction: this is NOT a movie.\n\r\nThis episode could have easily passed as one of the filler episodes, I still don't see its co-relation to the fifth movie but there you go, a Genie wakes up and all the kids wreak havoc to make their own personal wish, it really does remind you of how clumsy Sasuke once was, makes you kinda miss him when it was all fun and play, an, of course, some Kakashi fun into the mix as well, it can never go wrong.\n\r\nHonestly, I don't see anyone watchingthis outside of nostalgia for the old OG Naruto days.\n"
