The jokes did not age well, the plot was too slow at times, too fast at some other times, no consistency between comedy and drama, the animation is hilariously averagefor today\u2019s standard, and I can keep going.\n\r\nOne thing I\u2019ll give this adaptation is the voice acting, it was amazing, all the Japanese one and even the English and French dubs, they were outstanding, all on their own right, but only sound can\u2019t help a visual medium, it can only compliment what\u2019s already good.\n\r\nI genuinely discovered new levels of boredom watching this one, I even stopped for a prolonged period of time before I resume to finish the last 12 episodes. However, even amongst this sleep fest, there was a high peak I never expected, the prequel arc of Mt. Osore Le Voile, it was spectacular in every other way, plot, animation, acting, twists, I think it\u2019s the only solid saving grace that this adaptation provides.\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10.\n"
