    "content": "\n                Oh, man, it feels really devastating, having to watching a great show filled with hilarious happenings, very adventurious and cheerful, to only end in the most sad outcome possoible, it personally took me days to recover, and then I stumbeled accross this, show I give it a try I said, but the fear of it screwing me over again kept me from stepping in, several months after, I was scrolling down my to watch list, and this picked my attentions, a really strange nostalgic feeling filled me instantly, I really wanted to get some memories on the main series bck, it has really been along time since I watched it, but this time, I never gave in to the fear of being screwed over yet again, I prepared myself mentally and hoped for a better outcome, and that's what I got.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nAt first, it's just blunt episodic events that were very unrelated, but as I got into the show, it really wasn't strange, seeing how the original series was similar, as the episodes go, you will most definitely notice the massive shift of the focus of the story, a lot of plot points are being parodied into a more lightweight comedic approach, which is what I loved, I got enough sad stories at my disposal I guess.\r\nThe students, now at a more RPG setting are forced to kill this monster called the Demon King, which is their teacher, as they keep finishing several quests, they gain XP, that will allowed them to kill Kuro-sensei one day.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nNot the best, but I'm not complaining, the animations are rigid and sluggish  at times, but the way everything is drawn, in a more of a hybrid chibi way, it makes the animation on point honestly, the colors are as vibrant as ever if not more, and surprise, surprise, Kuro-sensei has never been this yellow before.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nSeeing how I watched the DUB version of the original series, it really was no other choice for me to see this one DUBed too, and I gotta say, I've never been happier to hear familiar voice before, there was some mastery voice acting in this, with of course some cringy ones, that aren't that relevant anyway, I loved to hear the opening and ending so much, with the latter being a cover of the original one anyways, so win-win I guess!\r\nThe old soundtrack was phenomenal, has it always been this epic?\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nI enjoyed seeing all those characters again, they are so many, that I'm surprised that I was familiar with all of them, that was a huge effort to remember all of their names, they are so diverse and unique, you really get the feeling of going and watching the main series just so you can see them, and explore them even more.\r\nOf course, Nagisa is still sexually abused, can't they cant him some slack?\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nAside from a few chuckles here and there, there wasn't really much to bring on, the show is basically a huge meme of the main series, it doesn't go to any serious topics, and I gotta say, this is surprisingly over sexualized for this type of shows, I mean, there is some really adult content in here.\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\r\nI ho\u00e7nestly would still recommend this, but only to a more adult audience, because some of this stuff is not PG-13 at all.\r\nIt's great for a couple of laughs, and an amazing refreshed of the parent story.\n"
