Filled with superheroism treats, but unlike One Punch Man and Boku no Hero Academia, this one helps itself to be as twisted and straight to the point than the last two mentions for what it holds of emotion and threats as itmanaged to dive into the more prominent psychological problems, what makes one a hero and the other a villain.\r\nAgain, something I mention in most of my reviews, but more with this one. I think the R (+17) rating labeling this series could never be well placed, there are extreme gore and more importantly sexual content in here. To what degree? well, naked women and men are very common, having conversations and that state. If that wasn't enough, they even go hardcore with a dude forcing another one to give him a blowjob, ugh. That aside, let's hit the keyboard and discuss some of the show's most prominent aspects.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nIchirou Inuyashiki, an old guy in his 50s (with a grandpa look like he's in his 80s or something) is living through the worst phase of his life, suffering from liver cancer, surrounded with angry family members that don't seem to give the guy a breather at all happens to get exposed to some mysterious extraterrestrial figures that turn his into a super advanced robot capable of destroying the earth. At the same moment, another guy happened to be passing by that got the same powers, Hiro Shishigami, a role model highschooler that seems to spend his days with his otaku friend Ando reading Manga all day long.\r\nThe story focuses on this two main protagonists who are antagonists of each other go through using their newly acquired powers in opposing manners, one saves people, the other murders them. All the events of the story move at a considerably fast pace that never lets you complain how boring the show is (which definitely is not). Propos to the direction team for handling the transitions between the two protagonists smoothly and this well.\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\r\nGenerally speaking, the art style this series has chosen to stick to is amazingly stunning and fits very well serious stories like this one. I loved how realistic character faces and expressions were like, no over-exaggerated eye sizes, no crazy Anime hairstyles, nothing of that. Most of the characters are actually ugly or average looking, sad truth, but most people in the real world are.\r\nSeeing how this show is labeled as an action thriller, it doesn't fall short of shinning at fast fluid movements on all of the fights, lasers shooting and superspeed flying has never looked so fluid. The art style is depicted in a way that makes it blend with 3D animations very easily looking at how it relies on 3D animations most of the time because how often complex mechanic transformation happens. I'm fine with the CGI usage in this show's case, it doesn't bother me 80% of the time, but God, at one scene it looked so awful I couldn't even keep looking without having painful flashbacks of those shitty 3D games of the 2000 that barely even run on the highly capable PS1 of the era.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nNow, this is a series full of massacres, so it's natural to get to hear screams, people freaking out... I think that the voice acting cast did that job perfectly (talking about the SUB here), some performances even left me trembling from shivers, the fear of the voices was only complimented by the crazy realistic ugly faces that come with it. And don't even get me started on the opening and ending themes songs. Those were so marvelous pieces of music, you get the hyped up opening to get you reading to start savage episodes, and then a calm ending theme song to help let the feels flow looking at how often you'll get to tear up at the end of each episode.\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\r\nMost of the shows can screw up this part really easily with annoying or unrealistic characters, but Inuyashiki not only takes places on a real-time setting but also brings up relatable human beings that makes you go, Oh, I could be on that guy's shoes. Also, the two main characters are one of the finest there are. First, we have Ichirou, an old dude who's lived most of his life as a casual citizen, acting good, working, a family type of guy, then he gets exposed to a greater fate than he could have ever dreamed off seeing how he never was the type of popular dude in his entire life. Never be the guy to hit on girls or be the center of the spotlights. Makes you think he would take advantage of his new powers to relive the things he missed, but his old age, wiseness, and experience of the world made him think of the powers as a means to save people, a blessing from the Gods that he has to act good with. And then you get the edgy hot high school boy, still in his rebellious days with nobody to guide him that easily began murdering people just because he was bored, and simply because he could. Very people with the same fate but lacking what their counterpart has.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nI always slack off finishing my shows, but Inuyashiki was a different story. I know there are being that can finish off 11 episodes on one setting, and I used to be one, but not anymore, my desire to follow up with the story lead me to finish the whole thing in 2 days sessions even though my time is super limited, if they didn't screw up the CGI parts sometimes, it would have been one of the greatest shows of its kind. Other than that, it was super exciting to know what happens next at the end of every episode, something that rarely ever happens to me. One other thing was the excessive references to One Piece and its Mangaka Eiichiro Oda, God bless him.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nWell, I tend to rewatch my favorite shows with my family 90% of the time, but unfortunately, not with this one. I'm mostly fine with minimal partial sexual references, have it be as gory as you want, but just don't over sexual the thing, and I'll be fine sharing it with family. Inuyashiki, unfortunately, crossed some lines there and went extremely at one point. But still, if you're on your own and don't mind sexual content, this series will have its effects on you. Buckle up and get some tissues ready though, this is one action centered show that will hit you emotionally as hard as those invisible bullets they shoot.\n"
