It wouldn' be such a big fuss, but when every single especial, movie or OVA is some sort of recap episode, then it's getting somewhat ridiculous. I guess, not only are sports IRL filled with in-between replays, but the Anime counterpart appears to embrace hat trope and materialize it into several recaps that parrot the same exact thing.\n\r\nOther than the panoramic commentary by the characters which are suddenly forth-wall-sexual, I really enjoyedthe original animations, the conversations they have and the inside jokes they made, really, that part alone carried this episode and I would have loved it if the entire episode was just that.\n"
