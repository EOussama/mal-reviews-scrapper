But I guess the head scratch tells you more than a sentence ever could.\n\r\nI feel bad because, on the one hand, you have this very charming, nostalgic (by the looks of it) mini-web series that tells you the makers poured a lot of love into shape and finalization, even when it is lacking any semblance of world-class production you see very often nowadays in mainstream shows, but then again, especially back in the day when this came out, the serieswas NOT the semi-giant it is today, and the fandom was much, MUCH smaller I comparison which excuses the low-quality production that might bother some.\n\r\nNot gonna lie, some episodes of this I preferred over the modern adaptation ones, but maybe not starting from this was my sin, to begin with. It also helps that the episode are bit sized and fly you by in an instance.\n"
