More like \"Please, Please, Please buy Overlord\" Edition! \ud83d\ude02 The art style is a total crack up, but props to them for a solid marketing strategy. \ud83d\ude0e #PlePlePleiades #Overlord\"\n\r\nPle Ple Pleiades Special Edition\" is a unique and entertaining spin-off of the original \"Pure Ple Pleiades\". This special edition was created as a way to commemorate the release of the first volume of the popular TV anime \"Overlord\" on BD & DVD. The creators behind this special edition did an excellent job of blending the cute and quirky art style of the original \"Pure Ple Pleiades\" with the darker and moremature themes found in \"Overlord\". This combination of vastly different elements was a bold move, but it worked beautifully.\n\r\nThe art style in this special edition is simply adorable. The character designs are classic chibi-style and the bright and cheerful color palette used throughout the show gives it a playful and light-hearted feel. The backgrounds are beautifully detailed and provide the perfect setting for the whimsical adventures of the characters. The visual effects are also top-notch, adding an extra layer of excitement to the already entertaining story.\n\r\nI say, more shows should take notes from this and improve their marketing strategies.\n"
