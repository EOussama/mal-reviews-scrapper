YOASOBI, the talented, very charming artist duo responsible for many generational grade Anime songs. And I\u2019m sure it is there by, no coincidence that whatever show they are involved with turns out to be just as great and grand with many fans backing it and a reputation that seems to escape even the Anime sphere.\n\r\nWith all of that said, it is a shocker to no one that Yuusha, yet another banger, turns out to be just as great and well defined YOASOBI classic that excelled both visually and audibly. The beat is heart racing, emotional and \u201calive\u201d, the visuals are just as gripping, grim, and bittersweet. Just like every other YOASOBI songs, it feels like an abstract piece of art waiting to be admired and boast about, but too little ink is there to satisfy the deed.\n\r\nIt feels kind of weird sometimes when it\u2019s too difficult if not impossible it is to separate a piece of art from its artist, a very familiar thing with most of YOASOBI\u2019s hits, and it is very apparent here. It is clear that Frieren and YOASOBI are very separate and independent entities but the song feels like it\u2019s part of the YOASOBI universe if that makes sense, it feels home to their work whilst at the same time complementing the bittersweet and slow nature of the Frieren story.\n"
