This is literally a World Govt. propaganda screening to the core lmao.\n\r\nLet\u2019s forget about the unfortunate timing of the airing, literally sandwiched in-between the hype episodes of Garp\u2019s invasion of Pirate Island.\n\r\nIt recaps all Admiral and important Marine officers (Sorry Smoker) and speeds up through some information and history of such, probably to hype up the stakes of the arc.\n\r\nA realization that has caught up to me recent year is that, the best One Piece arcs tend to always have Navy heavily involved at a larger scope, probably which iswhy this recap really felt like a meal. It was a good watch and an entertaining one at that.\n"
