I sure took a time, but I never tried to spoil anything during that time, and so Tokyo Ghoul:re was released...\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re follow Ken Kaneki after the events of the second season, I don't intend to spoil any plot points in this review, but let's say, things changed, and the world is a lot more gruesome and challenging too, old enemies attained to their injuries and are back, and also are the Ken's friends.\r\nAs somebody that never read the Manga, I really believe that this season was created with the idea in mind that everyone watching it would have already read the Manga, and thus will be able to keep up with the very fast-paced nature of the storytelling on this season, It really was a challenge to me to make up sense of what's happening most of the time, a lot of foreshadowing was present, a lot of dialog and action, but to mee, it still felt way too fast for me to be on the same page as the events were occurring.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nBeautiful, almost tastable eye candy on your screen, this one would go up into my compilation of amazing art, and hold a solid spot somewhere on the top. the Tokyo Ghoul series has always had some great art and animation, but this season took it all to a whole next level with its breathtaking details and fluid animation, it was almost distracting from the yet complex and fast plot points.\r\nI can at least appreciate the gore in this one, I like how they are not afraid to censor anything, but giving us all of the gruesomeness we deserve.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nI'd say, the sound production was at its most average form, the voice actors did their best, but it still didn't connect to me at the end, I didn't really like the opening song, but the end was great.\r\nAgain, the voice acting really was just as messy as the fast paced action, I could have sworn that if I had read the Manga first and then watched the season I would hvae grasped what's happening a lot better.\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\r\nOk, this is where I drew the line, I was okay with the character roster of the earlier seasons, but this was just too much, not that the new characters were bad or anything, but it was just too much, way too overkill for a short season as far as 12 episodes go, I had just taken a long enough break from Tokyo Ghoul to be greeted with loads and loads of new characters, it was a real challenge remembering their names, or even on which side they are, looking how most of them where similarily looking to one another.\r\nI would have loved if it had a smaller character roster because, for newcomers who never read the Manga, it feels more like a chore to keep up than actual entertainment.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI really was disappointed after finishing this season, I never felt hyped up at the part that I was supposed to, I never cried or felt sad or even connected with any of the characters, I was just sitting in front of a screen trying to understand what's going on most of the time, not really hating it, but not praising it either. I would probably do better with a rewatch, but that's something for another day.\n\r\n- Overall (7.2/10):\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re was a let down for me, I would suggest that you rewatch the two first seasons if it's been a while since you last saw them, because trust me, you will need to know all the prior information you can grasp at once, if you already read the Manga, I believe you'll find this one entertaining than I did, seeing those cool panel moments animated will definitely pay off with this new smooth animation, good luck.\n"
