On several instances, they end up doing very poorly with a massive neglection and a low following compared to the rest of the airing shows. Fortunately, Miru Tights not only broke the mainstream formula but always defied the odds and pushed the tides that hold similar shows from blowing up and has had quite a huge following from a big portion of the fandom for how odd and appealing to the masses it was. That mightturn back to the fact that what it tackles is still a very under-spoken on topic for what it set up to present. The traditional take on fan service has become way too saturated across several shows that a lot of fetishes rarely if ever discussed. \u201cHold my tights\u201d was this show's answer to that, an erotic 4 minutes long fan service packed haven that keeps on giving until it hit the climax that was known as the legendary episode 7, a new high of \u201cara ara\u201d was reached, and it might be a while until some other show steals the spot, if not a sequel of the same show does it itself.\n\r\n- Story (6.5/10):\r\nIt's clearly apparent that the premise of the show was never going to be about a groundbreaking story from the get-go, after all, a 4 minute long episode can only do so much with how much cramped it is with wild fan service that steals the spotlight from anything that has to do with the main plot, but it can't be helped but point out tiny glimpses to what looked like mini-story arcs involving several related characters where the cameraman is way more invested in tight shots that he does about keeping his job intact, which can be glorified as a great sacrifice for all of us. I've honestly seen shows that were supposed to be more story centered fall short on delivering a solid story progression as near as Miru Tights', and it only works in favor for Miry Tights to see how well it even nailed aspects it was never meant to touch upon.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nLet's be honest, the power of the visuals alone is enough to deliver an enjoyable experience of the glory of tights. Only by seeing the phenomenally consistent movie-quality episodes back to back, you'd excuse their short length, it was the pinnacle of quality over quantity for the year. Shading was the key, super tight cloth wrapping perfectly curvy legs with a bit of an overlay gradient that shows some skin does wonders.\r\nAll characters have a consistent design going for them, just like in real life, no crazy haircut heads bobbing back and forth and no unordinary over the top characters roaming with unworldly customs, just normal people living a normal relatable life, which makes it closer to what you'd see in real life.\r\nThe camera angles were crazy and satisfactory that I felt like I need to personally give a raise to the fictional cameraman myself.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nA good visually aesthetic show can only feel as complete as it is with the help of an at least decently paced vocals. Lots of heaving breathing and audible moans were spoken, the energy that filled the voice acting perfectly went along with what was on screen the whole time.\r\nToo bad we didn't have any opening to remember the show by afterward, but we at least had a decent ending song that plugs that kind of hunger.\n\r\n- Characters (6/10):\r\nI think the characters themselves needed a lot more work for them to stand out as different people. I found myself quite lost about who's who most of the time, I couldn't even remember any character names nor their relations with each other, but maybe that was due to how amazingly it executed what it was about \u201cfan service\u201d.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nBatting my eyes on everything bad I've said so far, personally, this makes a top tied fan service series that delivered on what it promised, episode 7 especially would remain as one of the best episodes of the genre for me. Now, I'm not a tights guy, I didn't see myself enjoying this series that much before I started it, but honestly, it was pretty fantastic to have these quality shorts of guilty pleasure to look forward to every week.\n\r\n- Overall (7.7/10):\r\nIt simple, if you're into fan service, then the show is for you, even if you're not about the \u201cfan service\u201d, the animation and the attention to details stood for a great eye service along, and it would be such a shame had you not given your eyes the treat they deserve.\n"
