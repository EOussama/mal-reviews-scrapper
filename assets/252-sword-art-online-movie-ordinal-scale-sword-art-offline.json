Sometimes, I worry about Mr. Reki Kawahara, the dude has some personal shit to settle with his fictional character that he \u201ctacitly\u201d approved this production that revolves around abusing the poor soul, so much so that Kirito himself is breaking the four wall just to scream for help.\n\r\nIt's pretty much a ritual so dar, having these commentary recap-sh shorts that follow certain arcs, well just have to deal with it from now on. If only they brought back Klein as a regular though. This one didn't only lack him, butit also lacked the infamous advice corner. A big downgrade in my eyes.\n"
