For a sequel that everybody was anticipating for a couple of years, it was way too big of a disappointment when the shocking announcement was made, and it even got more aggressive when the first teaser trailer first dropped. We're a bunch of scumbags, aren't we?\r\nIt's not clear who's to blame, but, the studios will not pull off a budget-busting production just like that, especially when a smaller one is involved, itwas never going to be on the same level of MAD house's adaptation, and we all knew it, but we still watched every episode on a weekly basis, and, was it really that bad?\n\r\n- Story (8.2/10):\r\nSurprisingly, I would root for this sequel as the better at storytelling, for what we've seen in the first season from blood-boiling action, it lacked a massive fuppa when it came to solid sequential storytelling, but it was never about that, and that's why it was so good nevertheless.\r\nOne Punch Man season 2 had less of Saitama himself and more of the other characters that fell under the \u201csidekick\u201d label in the first season, both heroes, civilians, and monsters, all had varying storylines, convincing backstories and overarching motives, we get to see that not every hero wears a cape, and not every monster has fans and horns, it was in a way an ideological clash between several characters, each crossing a uniquely defined path with Saitama as a neutral figure in the middle of it, with as minimal of a highlight as possible, leading to some great opportunities for other characters to shine.\n\r\n-  Art (8.1/10):\r\nLet's be honest guys, it was not that bad, if anything, just a few refinements from being a solid MAD-house-inferior piece of work, visually speaking of course.\r\nThe first three episodes had some amazing compositions and great production values, and then it seemed to have dimmed down a bit only for it to hit the peak at the very last 3 episode that you'd swear they had some other high budget studios take over the animation process.\r\nThe art style suffered a bit from the studio change, the colors now look way brighter and Isekai-ish (JC Staff leaving their mark), they gave off Saitama a weird gradient tint on his glorious bald head, which for the better or worse looks like that familiar pattern used on Anime girls' melons that works as a highlighter to their curvy meat, if you will.\r\nGenos, on the other hand, looked like a beaten up dollar store version of the one from the first season, I have nothing in defense of that, and pretty much everybody else looked normally consistent.\r\nI'm not going to lie, had the first season had the same kind of visual production value, nobody would have complained, everyone is just so held up on how much MAD house spoiled us with that Godly quality that they forget what really made this show great.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nFor an action-heavy punching simulator, you better bet the overloading screams and shouting is going to make for the majority of the dialogue is going to be just that. And it was amazing. Filled with an aggressive collective tone that complimented the monologues and word-shaming and made the battles even greater.\r\nI was massively disappointed with both the opening and the ending theme songs, they just lacked cohesive rhythms they almost made me watch to skip them. Like, where is iconic \u201cOne Puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunch\u201d at the beginning of every episode?\n\r\n- Character (8.7/10):\r\nThe best part about this season is the phenomenal character development and background breaks we had, something the first season lacked to the very core. Saitama for once had probably less screentime than some characters and for a great reason. It gave a chance for characters like other minor heroes, civilians and even villains (King, Suiryu, Garou...), it was just so well put down with the pace of the story, having all of them well connected to one another. A great example of how Saitama had always greatly affected the lives of most other heroes, it even haunted me with the theory of whether the hero Blast is really Saitama himself, but you never know.\r\nCharacter arcs go to such degree so as to have the show completely change its perspective on the world and everything depends on the character standing in the spotlight, a great example for this is how Suiryu, a strong martial art that looks down on the hero gets to live through an experience that changes all of that, or how Garou, a figure close to being the hero of his own show, go all out hunting heroes for some reason he thinks is just.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI personally had quite the blast, sure I missed the God tier animation that spanned whole episodes, but the show was never about the jaw-dropping animation, that was just a small part on what made the original a must watch. The universe of One Punch Man is just so written that it puts all the \u201cOverpowered protagonists are shallow and boring and they affect the story in a negative way\u201d to naught. Saitama is just ultimate strength itself, but the show still puts you into anticipation for other things that you don't even notice. What an entertaining watch it was.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nIf you've already enjoyed the first season, please just check this sequel out, if you're going about the same old JC Staff hate then just knock off your narrow shell and give it a try, it retains everything that made the first season a massive blow and it's just sad to see fans bash on it with a disgusted expression.\n"
