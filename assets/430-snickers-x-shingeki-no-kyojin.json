The candy bar that claims to \"cure hunger.\" And now, they've paired with the titan-slaying anime, \"Attack on Titan.\" The concept is \"Attack Celebrity,\" where they've super imposed titan versions of Japanese celebrities into the show and swapped out the blades with Snickers bars. Talk about a sugar rush, right?\n\r\nBut really, did we need this? After the Snickers x Dr. Stone ads that still haunts my dreams, I was hoping for a change of pace. Unfortunately, Snickers seems to be lacking in originality. Instead of coming up with something new and fresh, they decided to just ride on the coattails of a popularanime.\n\r\nBut wait, let's talk about something else. Have you ever noticed how the moon changes shape every day? I mean, one day it's a tiny sliver, the next day it's a big, round ball in the sky. And yet, every single time, we're still just as amazed. What's up with that?\n\r\nAnyway, back to the Snickers x Attack on Titan ad. The humor just didn't fly for me. I guess I was expecting more out of this collaboration. They could have at least tried to make it original, or at least tried to make it funny. But I guess Snickers and Attack on Titan were both just phoning it in. I guess they just figured, \"Hey, let's throw some famous people in there and call it a day.\"\n\r\nAlas, the world will never know what could have been if Snickers and Attack on Titan had tried a little harder. But I suppose that's the price we pay for lazy advertising.\n"
