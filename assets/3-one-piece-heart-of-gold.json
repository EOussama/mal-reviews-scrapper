This special (although I'm not sure why isn't it considered a movie), serves as a prequel to the One Piece movie; Film: Gold, but surprisingly, it stands out as an independent contained story in itself, It got all of these adventure elements, very exciting and thrilling.\r\nWhat really shines in this special is that all the straw hats got to do what they are good at, everybody played a role in their adventure, and that's what made it really stand out amongother movies and specials, it really gives you the vibe of adventure and discovering exotic islands, the hunt for treasure is the strongest feel however.\n\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nThere was a legend about a rare metal called \u201cPure Gold\u201d, but a legend is no more when it's proven real, right? (Just like the lyrics on the first One Piece opening), along the way, the straw hats meet a mysterious girl that she has had lost trust in people, and somewhat lost and alone, but as she spends time with them, she learns from them how important it is to believe in your friends, and that it's easier and more fun to reach your goals with the help of your loved ones, there is a messed-up backstory of course, at the conclusion of the movie, you will notice some great opportunity to expand the One Piece lore and world building, and there are some really interesting clues about the history of the world as well.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nDifferently better than Toei's weekly animation, you would certainly wish One Piece was a release of the same quality, even if we had to sacrifice the weekly episodes for fully seasonal releases, the color palette used is a bit yellowish, more lively than it usually is, gives a warm tone of summer, and the animation is no fodder too, the movements feel very crisp and fluid, however, there were some unnecessary additions I noticed while watching, whenever there was a moment of Observation Haki usage, they seem to add an awkward red color to their eyes, probably to indicate that they are using Kenbonshoku? It really wasn't that necessary, but the pluses are extensively greater that the downvotes.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nYes, your typical One Piece soundtrack is strongly present, but there are indeed some additional tracks in the backgrounds, especially a very emotional lullaby, that's very heartwarming, yet with a noticeable sad tone to it, like that Naruto filler (Natsohuboshi why are you so red...), aside from the tracks, there was a slightly different use of sound effects, like punches and kicks impacts, I usually prefer the normal ones used in, the , as I found these ones very unfitting, where you can see Sanji hiting a target as hard as he can while the empact sound is a bit low and doesn't reflect the might of his kicks.\n\r\n- Characters (7/10):\r\nWell, even in immersive adventures, there can be some quite annoying characters involved, let's start with the girl called \u201cOlga\u201d, I personally didn't think someone can match up with the annoyance of Boruto's personality, but hey, not only does she share the same hair color, she could possibly be his soul mate, both brats are very noisy, and can make you really on their opposite side.\r\nAnother character would be the villain, as uninteresting as I found him, I couldn't even keep his name in my memory, he doesn't bring specifically anything new to the table, just the same ideals as your typical east-blue villains, very empty but barks the loudest.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nYes, the special did leave me on my toes the whole time, mainly because of the sense of adventures, most of the times, the straw hats would be fighting one of the warlords, probably high ranking navy officers, or even some unknown name pirate crew, but this time around, there was a much brighter goal, it felt like a true adventure, totally what you would expect from aime like One Piece, the thrill and of discouvery is strongly present all the way, it was also amazing to see some familiar faces behid the scenes, and it even made watching the sequel movie Film: Gold more exciting.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI was very skeptical about whether to watch this special before diving into Film: Gold, but now that I've seen it, I would totally recommend it, and I certainly don't know what I was afraid of all this time from starting this.\n"
