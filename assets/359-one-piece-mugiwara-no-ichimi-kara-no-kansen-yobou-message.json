A true virtue that others should learn to apply.\n\r\nIt was cool to see Chopper give actually real-world medical advice, although, it felt very weird to have Zoro give advice too, and Franky who's already a Cyborg as well, but the fact that he operated on himself and rebuilt almost his entire body must have taken a lot of medical knowledge, and oh, of course, the man already dead, Brook.\n              "
