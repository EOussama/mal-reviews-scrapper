Your inner self.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI, for the most part, enjoy stories that have hidden meanings, stories that have under the blanket more than a typical user can get a grasp on, it's not for everyone, but if you do have the intellectual capacity to understand it, that is a great boost of ego on itself.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nThis 5 min of animation would get an 8 from me, I totally didn't waste my time watching it, or did I?\r\nno really, I liked it for the masterpiece it is,\r\nWait? what am I doing with my life? oh, an even better question, why are you reading this review? long story, short, I would recommend this to the more mature type of watcher, one that isn't just about the action, fan service, or animation, but one who wants something deep and exciting.\r\nhave we stuck in an infinite loop ourselves? you never know, ....... or do you?!\n"
