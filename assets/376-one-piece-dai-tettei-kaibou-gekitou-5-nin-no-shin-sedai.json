Toei struck gold with this recap.\n\r\nThis episode focuses solely on the Roof Piece nation, all fights no slow-paced reaction shots. It felt like a 24-minute-long Sakuga video honestly. Anyone can watch this and feast their eyes, bring themselves up to speed with what One Piece got going at the moment, even for Manga readers, it must be nice to get a bite-sized adaptation of all of those great moments.\n\r\nI wouldeven say, if you're not a One Piece fan but are interested in getting into the series, you can safely taste the water with this episode action wise. Nobody can hate that.\n"
