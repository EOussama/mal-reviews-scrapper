Released somewhere in the messy schedule of 2017's seasonal shitfest, a time when I was still with more dignity to even consider diving into the cursed land of seasonal Anime, but it was just a matter of time until I picked it out of my plan-to-watch list.\r\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the nostalgic ending song that I happen to have heard during its release, it would have been still buried in my endless list to an unnamed day, and oh boy did it still disappoint at the end.\n\r\n- Story(4/10):\r\nA Plot you say? Nowhere to be found, or at least, not one that makes sense anyway. I would have probably settled down with rating it a \u201c0/10\u201d, but given the consideration of nitpicky things it did remarkable right, it was going to be a cruel judgment in its right.\r\nHow do I put this in words?! It was as if the poor contributors of this lost cause of a story were cursed with a savage beast from the underworld, equipped with a pointy baton that kept smashing every sense of plot there is to smithereens and everything related, ending up wasting a plotline of great premise (and unfortunately, poor execution).\r\nIt all started when two naive high schoolers started hooking up as a sort of medicine they had to take to cure the depression that came from their crushes never accepting their feelings for them. Would they be able to heal their scars at the end?\r\nA truly appealing premise with somewhat of a sense of identity that doesn't follow the common mainstream formula of storytelling and provokes a lot about taboo relationships and lost pride to a youthful lust that doesn't know the way (It's been a year since that meme was a thing, get over it).\r\nAlong the lines of using a creative visual rule to lay out the story (more on this later), it was complimented with a yet unique approach that revolved around telling the story through different monologues of the characters involved that helped bring everything full circle, giving you a sense of satisfaction after you see every scenario from different perspectives.\r\nIt was somewhere midway where everything broke down like a terrible train wreck that you'd think the writer was barely having a cohesive thought process and still wrote down whatever came in mind with no consideration to common sense like a damn drunkard that literally every episode becomes like a taunting fever dream.\n\r\n- Art (8.7/10):\r\nOn the surface, it's apparent that \u201cKuzu no Honkai\u201d is visually distinguishable if you look attentively, you'd notice the rough lines around the edges, especially on the characters, design-wise, they looked really good, perfected modern scribbles that try to stay as Anime as possible all while still trying to keep the realism most of the Anime lack visually.\r\nBut that was not the reason it was so self-defining at all, the Manga-like lay out on some of the scenes do leave a great mark on the show that tells it apart, having a static background behind a two highlighted face close up Manga-style does leave room for so much more symbolism and a great breather for the overall animation.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nLet's get the minor things away, the voice acting was decent, I really liked Hanabi's voice actress, going with a perfect tone of voice, while the rest of the case was pretty average, aside from maybe Akane's. But man, did I hate Moca's high pitched voice that screams of a childish loli.\r\nThe opening song was good, but not half a quarter as good as the ending is, and as I stated, a fantastic vocal performance that's the reason I decided to finally watch the show for.\r\nThere goes another bad adaptation that has fantastic vocals (The same as \u201cTaboo Tattoo\u201d and its undeserved opening song).\n\r\n- Characters (3/10):\r\nQuite a shallow over dramatic cast if I have ever seen one.\r\nLet's start by labeling every single one of them as a \u201cScum\u201d, don't you love it when a show is that much self-aware that it says it in the title?\r\nProbably the most uninteresting, contradicting and hypocritical group of characters out there. If the plot is to blame for 70% of flaws surrounding this show, the characters can take the other 50%, I know, that doesn't add up to 100%, because it's how much sense this show make anyway.\r\nThis was an example for a show that had a faster plot than the characters can keep up with, you'd be expecting even the slightest character development after a certain event, but no, not even after you, as a viewer, read all of the hints they let out and thinking, oh, logically, X is going to be the outcome, oh, let me stop you right there, scum and logic have nothing in common.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nDespite the many lows in there, there was a reason I sit through this in 2 days straight, although, I was starting to get fed up of the overly dramatic turnouts nearing the conclusion of the story.\r\nI had quite the laugh on some parts, and even nearly sympathized with some characters, but not after the plot turned its back on me giving me the middle finger.\n\r\n- Overall (6.64/10):\r\nI'm not sure if this is a recommendation entry in my book, if you were looking for any of the five rules of thumb that makes a show watchable (listed above), then you see how bad this one scales up, although, if you can settle with some drama that you won't have to take seriously, this is one hell of a guilty pleasure that I probably will never end up rewatching.\n"
