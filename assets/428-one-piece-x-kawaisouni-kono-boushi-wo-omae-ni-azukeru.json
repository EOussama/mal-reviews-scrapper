It\u2019s like if official accounts were allowed to shitpost.\n\r\njust watch it, a badly out-of-tune We Are remix with doodles of the characters from several moments of the story being memed on, the jokes are clever enough to have to rewatch several times in a row.\n\r\nThe franky meme alone deserves a watch. let alone the Zoro slander, this is something not even the most hateful twitter accounts can come up with when slandering a characters, let alone it being an official collaboration makesit infinitely funnier.\r\nGo ahead, it\u2019s on YouTube on the official One Piece channel. A preview for volume 108.\n"
