    "content": "\n                Black Clover feels so weird without Sister Lily and with Yuno losing to that slouch.\n\r\nThis reads like a very early draft of the original Manga, not even past the editorial stage. Black Clover isn't the brightest gem but this is just way below the parent series and what it set up to be. It does deliver the core idea of the parent Manga but a lot of points could have been better, for example, the absence of Sister Lily, the Church, Asta, and Yuno's origins... However, you can still see similarities all over, it's a cool first concept where you wonder at what Black Clovercould have been but by no means a perfect first look.\n"
