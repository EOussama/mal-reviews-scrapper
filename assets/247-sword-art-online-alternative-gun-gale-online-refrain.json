Beats me.\n\r\nThe only thing worth checking out about the recap is the after credits compilation of some of the shots from the show coupled with the \u201ccorrect\u201d sound effects, I wish they had that on the entire episode, it would have been worth it at last.\n\r\nReally, the recap is just M and Pito narrating over what went on the first Squad Jam, sort of like a couch-conversation style.Still, not worth your time. However, watching it through, it really shows how little happened in the first 5 episodes, truly the trashiest kind of entertainment, I love it. I can easily suck my mind out and give the dude a comfy place beside me to enjoy the show and still go over the episode no problem.\n"
