What I'm trying to get at is those series have less in common than they appear to be. Aside from the setting, there is nothing else of much notice to link the two.\r\nAnother common question that goes through the head of newcomers is the length of the series while heading \u201c91 Days\u201d one would easily assume the series would have 91 episodes, but no.\r\n91 Days is a 12 episodes longshort story that covers roughly 3 months, thus the 91 days, is it enough might you say? 91 days sounds more like a recap if told in 12 episodes but isn't that the same with all stories? This is a story about revenge, decisions made on bullet time speed, one flicker and years of planning might fall off. This is a story about redemption...\n\r\n- Story (8.3/10):\r\nLiving a fun happy life until the night of the massacre, Angelo witnessed the murder of his parents and younger brother at the hands of a mafia group called the Vanetti family. Making a run for it at last moment and remained silent in hiding.\r\n7 years later he was sent a message giving him the signal to start the long-planned revenge that started by him infiltrating the Vanetti family as a fresh member, climbing the ladders and taking down his family's murdered until he makes it for the top dog, the Don of the family. Along with his path to revenge, he becomes the best buddy with one of the murderers with only makes it far more emotional and hard to finish what he started. Would he disregard his feelings? would he leave everything behind and start anew? These kinds of questions happen to pass through your mind every so often while watching this show for how characters interact with one another.\r\nThe story follows a linear path, no excessive flashbacks, and no rushing through the events. The protagonist plays his moves carefully and plans further steps ahead of the viewer every moment.\r\nI really think that 91 Days stands out from other similar shows/movies with its fresh ideas that make up for the minimalistic clich\u00e9, as it draws heavily from the likes of The Godfather franchise.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nI'm very open-minded about different art styles, and one that I don't get to see very often is this generic simplistic art style that represents people from western countries the best, it goes really well with the Victorian and prohibition eras, it adds a lot of realistic feel and depth to the characters as there are no overkill eyes that seem to cover half of the face or a super Sayan hairstyle that's out of this world. Everything adds depth to the era and help convey the message.\r\nThe animation was good, above average most of the time but at its best on highlight moments, gun shootouts, knife fights, and hand to hand combat seem fluid and realistic, no over the top speed and nothing non-worldy.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI have to come straight and say this, this is one of those shows where the DUB is ways better than the SUB. Going through the prohibition era again, they absolutely nailed the accent, I had little problems with the female voice acting where it sounded very forced sometimes, but the main cast that had 90% of the show focused on them was just amazing. The soundtracks and sound effects were stunning as well, puts you in a strong mood to wearing a tuxedo and buying a luxurious classic vehicle and go for a hike on the countrysides.\r\nI'm a begger for great opening and ending theme songs, and this one didn't disappoint at all. from the same artist(s) that made Tokyo Ghoul's and Psycho-Pass' theme songs. One would argue it doesn't fit the tone of the era, but it really suited the theme of revenge with its dark tone.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThose weren't the best characters out there, but damn they weren't the least annoying, everybody was likable on their own way, aside from a few that were supposed to be disliked. They really pushed the boundaries and made you see the enemies, the people that killed the protagonist's family as humans, they feel for each other, they love, they care about their loved ones as well making you question morality in Angelo's revenge.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThere were those moments that really made me invested so much in the show I could have sworn I wanted to give this one a greater score if it weren't for some downfalls. Almost all episodes ended with a twist worthy of making you start the next episodes until you run out of them, a solid crime Anime right there.\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nThis one would be a hidden gem especially for The Godfather fans, it really is a solid crime show, covers a lot of historical themes and focuses on the might of mafia families and their powers, I would absolutely recommend this if you're in the mood for some old school crime thriller show.\n"
