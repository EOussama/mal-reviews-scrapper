See, 3 ba movies in succession kind lead you down the way, pre-writing a template for your fourth and last review of this movie collection in a devastating tone of betrayal, just showing how much of a let down it was for me till this point, but this movie kinda slaps. Although, not as hard as I would have liked.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nSome would argue that Bleach isn't your mindblowing literature epic as it tends to priorities the battler aspect of what makes a Shounen good and disregards everything else that wouldmake it excellent. The past three movies failed miserably at maintaining the least amount of mediocre screening that the faith for this last movie was already clear and set, but reality was none of that.\r\nHell Verse goes back to the origins of Bleach, whereas the previous movies focused on Ichigo protecting random people and close friends, this one hit back right at the OG spot, where Ichigo is cornered into protecting his sisters who have been entangled into some hellish scheme that would mater make more sense.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nIt's apparent that every movie up until this one has had a noticeable visual upgrade that reminds you it's a movie production, but this one was just exponential.\r\nThe design and aesthetic that went with the hell verse was just astonishing, great location with a creative direction and atmosphere, the lighting varies from one level to the other, it felt different and fresh.\r\nThe fights were breathtakingly choreographed, nicely paced, and steadily scaled.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nRevolting against Bleach's audible accomplishments is a crime at this point, if the show were to be nominated for anything, this is where it consistently shined.\r\nThe OST composition in this number was just insane, new remixes and subtle transitions between different tracks were just, wow.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nUnfortunately, the new cast which composes the villainous side was yet another en of the week baddy that didn't know their place. They brought nothing new or memorable to the table and the constant \u201cThat's impossible\u201d spam definitely was of no help.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nThis was by far my favorite Bleach movie, the only worthy movie of a rewatch in my eyes, it's easy to follow, features hype fights, and weirdly nostalgic for some reason.\n\r\nOverall (7.8/10):\r\nFor me, this is movie is to Bleach what Naruto Shippuden movie 3 was to Naruto Shippuden, you can easily recommend this to friends who aren't Bleach fans and they might still enjoy it as it offers a portion of what Bleach really is without spoiling any major plot threads.\n"
