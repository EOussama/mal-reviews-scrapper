The next step is looking at several movies that relate to said series and the first one usually gives off nostalgic vibes, even for the newer audience. Sadly, in Bleach's case, that couldn't be further than the truth.\n\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nAs much as I hate to say it, this felt like a nicely animated filler arc that lacks an interesting plot, characters, and villains.\r\nThis self-contained story introduces an interesting concept that deals with memories in the world of Bleach, and pretty muchanything else felt like an excuse to justify saying; \u201chey, this thing exists, it can totally happen, and here's how it goes\u201d that could have been easily a line that Urahara drops at some point.\r\nThe entire thing plays like your typical Bleach filler arc, some forgettable character named Senna stumbles across Ichigo and gang claiming to be a soul reaper until the tides loosen and the villain group interested in capturing her appear and force her to seek Ichigo's help.\r\nThe villain himself couldn't have been less interesting even if they tried so. Pulls up the clich\u00e9 trope where he stabs Ichigo in his Bankai effortlessly form only for Ichigo to somehow defeat him on their second encounter.\n\r\nThe ending was kind of bittersweet, basically, a puppy-beater plot. Here's a cute and helpless pup, we're gonna kick him around, now start crying.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI guess aside from something else that I'll talk about later, this was the only thing that carries the movie.\r\nIt simply looking nice and alive. I swear Bleach's animation and art somehow always emit a unique aura that can't be felt anywhere else.\r\nThe borderlines are crisp, the colors contrast each other nicely and the animation is fluid enough to make the dull fights epic enough.\n\r\nSound (8.8/10):\r\nFinally, the real star of the show, the OST.\r\nNo one can deny that Bleach bundles and always has. There are a lot of very iconic and fire soundtracks that put most others to shame.\r\nThe sound effects are also very good and crisp, more believable than most shounen shows too. The voice acting is spot on, both the Sub and the Dub were great, I found myself alternating between the two the entire run of the movie.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nRating the same cast of character that we see each episode of the TV series would be kinda unfair, so I'm gonna focus on the new faces instead. Senna, I guess I've stressed enough how dull and uncompelling she was. Her role as a main character in this movie gives her more opportunity to shine and show off, but she, instead, ended off acting more like a hostage that drives the plot forward than a contributor to cleansing the evil.\r\nThe villain group was just another failed attempt of an evil organization, all fodder with nothing more to them, and their head can't decide when to be a snowflake or an Aizen level threat for once and for all.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nTo me, Movies are another escape from the show, in the show to enjoy the same show. Does that make any sense? If I'm watching 900 episodes of One Piece, at times I would want to break away from Luffy's constant screaming at the same villain for multiple episodes and rather watch a movie that diverts from the every-day quest and explores other adventures of the crew. This was not my experience with this movie.\r\nIt felt like escaping the epic canon to watch an average condensed filler arc, it did have its moments, yes, but by no means did I feel like visiting it anytime soon. It was okay.\n\r\nOverall (7.26/10):\r\nAs big of a fan as I like to imagine myself, that was hella underwhelming. I dove in with full-on excitement and big expectations, but I ended up discarding all of that in the first 20 minutes of the movie because I know I recognize that tone and pacing, I've been through any filler arcs across multiple series and that feeling was not strange to me.\r\nIt's very hard to recommend something like this related to a series you like, especially to newcomers, fearing that they might get the wrong idea about the show, because Bleach can be so much better, so much more, and Memories of Nobody was so far away from being any of that.\n"
