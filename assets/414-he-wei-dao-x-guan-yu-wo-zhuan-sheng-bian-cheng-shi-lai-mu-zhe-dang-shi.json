    "content": "\n                \"He Wei Dao x Guan Yu Wo Zhuan Sheng Bian Cheng Shi Lai Mu Zhe Dang Shi\" is certainly a mouthful of a title, and it's clear that it's a commercial for a Chinese noodle brand. To be honest, I'm not sure why MAL made me watch this. Sure, it's a nice addition to the Tensei Shittara Slime Datta Ken franchise, but as a standalone commercial, it falls short. The animation is nothing to write home about and the commercial is far too long for something that is essentially just an advertisement. I've seen far more impressive and creative anime-themed commercials out there. On theplus side, it's nice to see Rimuru playing nice for a noodles commercial. I suppose it's a nice little treat for fans of the franchise, but as a standalone commercial, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n"
