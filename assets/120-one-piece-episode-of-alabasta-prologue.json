    "content": "\n                Alabasta, one of the most loved arcs of One Piece, and I'm sure many of us watched or at least know of the movie of that arc where they recap what happened in a short one-hour animation, One Piece: Episode of Alabasta - Prologue is as its title suggests, a prologue to the movie where they cover up the events of Whisky Peak ignoring the rest of the arcs leading up to Alabasta (Little garden and Drum island).\r\nSurprisingly, this one stands out as a really solid 15 minutes recap, with beautiful animation, the highlight was, of course, Zoro and Luffy's dual.\r\nHowever, abut downgrade was Vivi'scharacter design, the rest of the characters still felt the same, only with an upgraded quality of animation, but the case of Vivi was totally different, it's it a whole other character impersonating her, you could tell from looking at her face, she had that special uncanny look at her that makes you rather uncomfortable, she looked okay before, I wonder what made them redesign her.\r\nOne other thing was her clothing, it matches the Manga. As some of you might not know, in the Manga, Vivi wore a shirt of different pattern that had explicit circles that exploits some sexuality, so they had to change that on the original Anime adaptation, but it seems they didn't bother with that here and had her wear that questionable shirt instead. And talking about sexuality, all the females look to have gained a cup size upgrade to an overwhelming extent.\n"
