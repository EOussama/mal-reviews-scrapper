    "content": "\n                Mob Psycho 100 has been a very unusual and interesting case of study from an avid Anime fan's perspective. With each season, it gets harder and harder to classify under a specific genre. Shounen? Drama? Slice of Life? Why not all?\n\r\nThis show has been an entertainment monster for the years it spanned, and to no one's surprise, season 2 was a peak in the medium, and season 3 surely followed. Although not as consistent, still in the limbo verse between seasons 1 and 2. To say the least, it was a phenomenal trip all the way through the end.\n\r\nIf you read my previous seasons' reviewsyou'd see me often boast about the character development rights this series tackles, but this season was even more of a step up in that regard, all in all, everyone, and Mob especially went through huge changes and beat a lot of challenges and surpassed themselves in unexpected ways. It truly is an example other shows need to take in that regard.\n\r\nThis show is more than a seasonal fade-out, it's an era marked by One sensei who struck the world with his One Punch Man works, but evolved it to completion in perfect amends with Mob Psycho 100.\n\r\nMob will be more than missed. But he will always be there whenever I want a nostalgic rewatch. Don't miss out on this one.\n\r\nOverall: 9.44/10.\n"
