This is a dark tale, but with light-hearted comedy half of the time, but yet remains to be serious the other half, this is the telling about a long forgotten God!\n\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nYato, is the God of war that became to be forgotten in the modern world, seeing how people started having faith in science when dealing with war and conflict rather than praying to that one divine being that used to grant wicked wishes, and keep the blood flow going, which he is saving up a budget from doing several every-day tasks for 5-yen in order to build himself a shrine of his own, he gets to meet this very interesting girl, Iki Hyori who got herself involved with him unwillingly in a chain of events that changed her view on life.\r\nAlong the way, Yato gets an acquaintance, a young boy who has yet to meet somebody who guides him the right way, rebellion can be really tough on both sides, but at the end, gentle words can patch up the deepest injuries of the heart.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nAbsolutely stunning, In most modern anime shows, the quality of the animation tends to lower few episodes in, but that was not the case with Noragami. With this series, I got to see some of the best drawn male figures to date, I mean, take the protagonists, Yato's eyes are just beautiful and so wonderful to look at, so blue they can distract you from the action going on display.\r\nThe animation was fluid, almost flawless, never noticeable sluggish or lazy, and let's not forget about the backgrounds, the details are just on point, all the lighting and shadows, ugh, just perfect.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI could go all day praising the wonderful opening and end them songs, probably the most thing I'm going to miss after finishing this up.\r\nthe protagonist's voice actor, is the astonishing Kamiya Hiroshi, who also voices the beloved (Levi in Attack on Titan) and (Law in One Piece) and many other popular characters is doing a fine job with this role, balancing between the serious voice tone and carefree comedic tones amazingly, the soundtrack was okay for the most part.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThe character rooster here is not that big, but remains very consistent to the storytelling, Yato is just greatness over greatness for a protagonist, I don't think I've ever complained or disliked his decisions, so smooth and easy going, a very likable and mysteriously interesting character with a lot for him to say than appears on the surface.\r\nThere are other annoying characters too, but they are upon improvement later on, which is a payoff in itself.\r\nAside from the main cast, the side characters are also rich and intriguing too, it gets you begging for more screen time for them.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nI really enjoyed this watch, I was brought here because of a random encounter with the series's opening theme song, but the story and characters were what kept me hooked till the end, I even got to finish this in 3 days, with is rarely ever to happen for me lately, I know it's too much for a 12 episodes long series, but for my tight schedule, I had to postpone some more important stuff just to follow along this.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nI would totally recommend this series, at least for now, I know I have a new trump card in my disposal when discussing anime series with friends, the series while having some minor fanservice, and I repeat, very minor, it's safe to watch it with friends and family.\n"
