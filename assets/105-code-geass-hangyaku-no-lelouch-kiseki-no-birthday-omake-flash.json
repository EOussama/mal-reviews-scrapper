    "content": "\n                Please before you proceed reading this, for the sake of avoiding critical spoilers, we're talking end of the game spoilers here. In case you're still not finished with the main storyline, just give this your back and come back some other time, that is, in case you still insist on giving this a shot.\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I wonder what's behind---\u201d, that's a good lyric from Glassy Sky, an amazing soundtrack from Tokyo Ghoul, but that's beyond the scoop of these few paragraphs. I really don't fully understand why is this a standalone thing and what were they intending from it to be.\r\nAll, in short, it's looking tobe somewhere after the events of the two major installments of the franchise, after Lelouch and Suzaku are presumably \u201cdead\u201d and they happened to get caught by some stupid mistake in a very humorous and unserious way. They were talking and hitting towards a new upcoming series, so I don't know if that was a sneaky advertisement to something to come?!\n\r\n- Art (2/10):\r\nVery lazy and deformed, not event in a noticeable Chibi style, they all looked like an elementary school drawing with no motion what so ever, like a play carved onto card piece and being moved statically by hand with no depth to them.\n\r\n- Sound (1/10):\r\nThere was literally none, no soundtracks, no voice acting, nothing but pointless sound effects, nothing to give more context at all.\n\r\n- Enjoyment: (4/10):\r\nHuge mixed up feelings about this, I really don't get the core idea but still appreciated the second sighting of humourous Code Geass characters. Probably the strongest thing this got going on is its short length, otherwise, it would have been a torture to sit through it all.\n\r\n- Overall (2.3/10):\r\nUnless you were that eager to get into this, there is nothing of value in seeing it other than waste another 3 minutes of your life, and life is very expensive.\n"
