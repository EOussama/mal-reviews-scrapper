Yes, it\u2019s a time stall for the production of future episode, but for the consumers, it is hell on earth.\n\r\nI originally read the Manhwa a long time ago and I\u2019ve been keeping up with the Anime version ever since its debut, it has surely been an interesting outlook on the series especially for how different both versions are but I gotta say, this recap slid in right into place, being a run down through the first seven episodes,it really fits in well in the chronological placement as many would argue, this is when the true story begins, all of the past episodes were simple set up of what eventually becomes a more complex and intertwined plot.\n"
