The feeling of emptiness you get after witnessing an impactful story and getting attached to the characters. But did Bleach leave that strong of an impact in me, as a fan that has only gotten into the series 2 years ago, frequently having occasional, sometimes lengthy breaks in betweenarcs. Was it because I never wanted it to end, or was it because the show was already burning me off, discarding every wrench of hype and excitement I had for it before I invested the time to check it out?\n\r\nAfter having watched Naruto, and then passed through the grueling but phenomenal experience that was and is One Piece, Bleach was the only behemoth in the way of me obtaining that sweet, seducing big three completion trophy. Although it is an imaginary one, being a fan of Anime and Manga, in general, gets me in the spirit to see all, or at least, most of what impacted the industry throughout the years, and the big three were probably the biggest push that's still holding its flare alongside One Piece till this day. And with Naruto having already wrapped up, and One Piece still serializing, Bleach always felt like that abandoned son who had quite as much potential as the two but ended up being discarded and left out to wither by the eternal unescapable decay known as time. We can only hope for a continuation or even better, a reboot sometime in the near future, but for now, all we have is a bundle of OG action, packaged into a balanced amount of Badassery and grueling filler.\n\r\nStory (8.3/10):\r\nComing up from an era where what's considered clich\u00e9 and oversaturated now was just the norm and sometimes, the pickle of storytelling from what concerns Anime, stepping in fully knowing that it's a Shounen show about superpowers and never giving up I guess, it does stand the weight of time, seeing as even now, most modern Shounen seem to cling to the same trend as back then, so the story comes with a big of familiarity, even for a recent Anime fan that has never seen a show passed the 2010's era.\n\r\nWhat really fascinates me about Shounen is the varying and unique themes. Condensing this to the big three only; You've got Ninja in Naruto, Pirates in One Piece, and Shinigami in Bleach, very interesting on their own way, but to me at least, Bleach has a very distinctive setting, something that revolves heavily on fiction and urban legends, religious references and most of all, a cut of the fascinating Japanese folklore.\n\r\nWith a disappointing tone, however, unlike the other two shows, where Naruto aims to become a Hokage, and Luffy being the King of the Pirates, Ichigo stands in a very odd place, where his personal goal is not quite clear, seeing how he was dragged into the Shinigami game as a force of circumstance by some guy who apparently broke ten walls passed the fourth one and directed to story in which he exists making sure everything goes according to their *plan*. Of course, you could say that Ichigo is in for protecting his loved ones, but that's about it. But an unclear goal doesn't always lead a boring journey.\n\r\nSpanning several arcs and saga, dropping multiple unique powers and heavy players into the story, the unfinished cultural phenomenon and member of the big three (Bleach) has layout out an interesting formation for its major arcs, that co-relate perfectly with the main characters.\r\nLooking at the quad; Rukia, Orihime, Sado (Chad), and Ury\u016b serve more than just characters that accompany Ichigo in his journey, but rather as pillars of their own Sagas that tell a self-contained story wich still relates heavily with the general scope of the story, in which Ichigo IS the one used to tell their stories through, like the camera in an FPS game.\n\r\nAfter the first arc \u201cAgent of the Shinigami\u201d, where Ichigo is introduced to the nature of his power, his natural foes and basically, the system in which the world runs on, Rukia Kuchiki, the mysterious Shinigami that gets Ichigo in the game acts as the key that leads the story into the \u201cSoul Society\u201d saga, admittedly, the best \u201cintroductory\u201d Saga amount the big three, and probably, all of Shounen (Big that's debatable). As it spans 2 arcs, efficiently introducing all there is about Shinigami, how they operate and how they come into play and basically labeling them as the \u201cgood\u201d side. I gotta give Kubo-sensei some points on how to cleverly direct the plot looking at how amazing the transition between the first arc and this saga happened, with Rukia (a Shinigami) being the bridge in which Ichigo steps in and then out (The Soul Society, where the Shinigami reside) at the end of it.\n\r\nRight after that spectacular introductory saga, comes the amazing \u201cArrancar\u201d saga, which spans 7 arcs of destructive battles and fast-paced sword clashes against evolved Hollows (If you will) and is told utilizing Orihime Inoue (Suffered gravely from a lost family member by the hands of Hollows) to narrate what goes through from action, desperation, to emotion. It had definitely had its ups and certainly, lows, mainly because it felt like a bootleg recycle of the fantastic Soul Society saga at first, until it branches off, making something new of itself. This is where also my favorite stand-alone arc was. \u201cThe past\u201d arc.\n\r\nAfter what felt like an endgame for the series, and after so many episodes and development, Sado (Chad) gets his shot to shine, but still somehow missed it, having the spotlight mostly focused on Ichigo once again, ignoring what probably the best spot for Sado to take. The \u201cFullbring\u201d saga, which was also its own single arc \u201cThe Lost Substitute Shinigami\u201d arc shined some new lights on stuff that we used to question at the start of the series, but got lost in our thoughts as other things were taking up attention. The arc makes a great effort to somehow, level up the risks at stake even after a faith deciding a grand war, it gave off some characters more development than they did the entire series and overall was a very different experience from the rest of the show, with a brand new theme, somewhat of a darker atmosphere. I'm still swearing on episode 358 as being my absolute favorite in the series, from what unique and heart-racing directing techniques it had that really made it show the horror that the characters are living. (Tsukishima, you rat)\n\r\nFinally, comes Ury\u016b, although, at this point, the Anime has already finished, so if it wasn't for my curious stupid, I wouldn't have been spoiled about, even if those were some minor spoilers. Let's just say, there is something about Quincies in there.\n\r\nBrilliant, that is if the fillers made it any easier to sit through. What was probably my biggest and most obvious reason for taking multiple breaks in between the arcs was the dreading filler arcs that startup with a raised amount of hype, but die out 3 to 5 episodes later. I always watch my shows filler-filled or not, I endured Naruto's filler, TWICE, and it was hard, One Piece's filler was actually very entertaining and fir the theme of the story very well, their short and minimal length (casually 2 to 5 episodes) was a big factor in their enjoyment, but Bleach's filler was long, dreading, and hard to follow. I would give credits where credit is due, so the \u201cZanpakut\u014d Unknown Tales\u201d arc, you hit the jackpot. That is what I call a filler, and right after, follows the \u201cGotei 13 invading army\u201d arc, the animation in this both arcs was amazing, speaking more specifically the final fight between Ichigo and Kager\u014dza was probably my favorite fight animation-wise in the entire series, with eye-melting visuals, fluid movements and amazing coordination, it was way too good for a filler fight and it didn't sit with me though how such a budget was spent on filler material while some of the biggest highlights of the show looked very pale in comparison.\n\r\nThe pacing kind of drops and lifts up randomly, very dependent on the arc at play, there are your fast-paced arcs like \u201cThe past\u201d arc, and pretty much everything else varies from time to time.\n\r\nArt (8.2/10):\r\nOf course, for a relatively old show, the first thing that strikes the eye is how dusty the whole thing looks. We've been spoiled a lot with top-notch move-like animation in modern seasonal shows, so it shows when looking at something from a prior era of the industry where even the aspect ratio feels like being in the stone age, melting iron and dusting seashells with Senku. But given consideration, those were different times, and for sure, and as noticeable as it is, as you get through from arc to arc you definitely notice spikes in visual quality, and that's not county the highlights that get the better treatment than the rest of the episodes.\n\r\nA long-running bless that comes with watching Bleach is the quality character design. Mainly talking about transformations, you get to see some of the most pleasing and interesting looking figures. Feathers, wings, horns, holes in the chest, spiky swords, something that you'd imagine wouldn't quite work out if assembled together, but it proves you wrong as soon as you take a glance at it, and start unconsciously to appreciate the talent that made that possible. Sometimes, I personally stop and think if Kubo-sensei passed off a chance to get into fashion design.\n\r\nOne thing I think this show does the best compared to the other two show from the big three is the use of particles that go into creating dust, fog, lightning, smoke, fire and every other practical effect, they all feel so flawless, as though they are having a physical weight. They appear thick (but not as THICC as Rangiku), dense and powerful. The impact the camera and the viewport itself the same way the characters react to them. They have a presence.\r\nHowever. When it comes to shaping up character faces, it seems that Kubo's brush always twists out the same way. That would explain what a huge variety of male characters appear similar to Ichigo in a way that even his father and both sisters don't. Sh\u016bhei? Ichigo with a different hair-color and some tattoos, Ikaku? Bald Ichigo and so on...\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nI love talking about the vocals. And Bleach makes my love for vocals even more passionate. To start with. All of the openings and endings are amazing. disdainful and reflect the tone of their respective arcs very well. Opening 1 is a straight-up party banging classic, opening 5 is a continuous eargasm, opening 12 is a hyper overflow for what makes the greater part of the Arrancar arc's battle, and opening 13 is a visual-vocal masterpiece bundle, rocking with an amazing song paired with a product of some interesting classic film trickery, which creates a composition of encrypted messages through the visuals that may not accordingly tell what's happening at the first glance.\n\r\nThe soundtracks are straight out a winner here. It blows both Naruto's and One Piece's collection for me personally. Heavily relies on a Spanish cord which encapsulates perfectly what's thrown at it on the visual dimensions; sorrow, despair, surrender, terror, victory...\n\r\nBefore some of you sneaks up on me with an uppercut. Yes, I watch the English Dub version of Bleach, And it was glorious. I do believe that the Japanese version is probably more immersive and compelling, but that's just my tradition when it comes to watching any of the big three. The first watch is always in English Dub, and then every other rewatch is switching over to (Mostly) the superior Sub. What can I say? I have literally no complaints. I loved all the actors and actresses. They truly were doing something they loved.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nI've talked about this briefly when I was discussing the story. Ichigo's biggest problem as a character is his unclear goal. Although it doesn't get in the way of the story, it does leave a lot of desire in him as a protagonist. And the Anime at least doesn't disclose on that.\r\nAside from that, you can still see him as a relatable character, one that cares about whom he loved, he wants to protect them, he wants to be there for them, very selfless and very young. Very easy to relate to.\n\r\nAlong with the progress of the story, every saga introduces a huge bundle of new faces to keep track of, but it gets easier seeing as each one of them is, for the most part, likable. Or at least from each faction (Shinigami, Arrancar, Fullbring, Quincy...), there is always those select of characters that keep it interesting for you.\r\nThe main villain of the broadcast part of the story that the Anime follows is, to say the least, a very attention deserving character. Normally you'd find yourself interested in his ideology, keeping up with his twisted thinking only because apparent as his true nature slowly but surely shows. Orchestrating every other major twist in the show in a way that would leave you wondering if he's broken through the four walls already and planed ahead of you having to watch the show in which he stars at. A good example I like to pair him up with is Dofflamingo, but only the twisted side of both of them.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nBleach was a very odd experience, especially having watched it last, after One Piece and Naruto, but it feels quite at home with the other two. It's been a slow two years for me, filled with life-changing decisions that it's reminiscent for me enough to get stuck in my head for the rest of my life. I got attached to the characters, had my fair share of fanboyism multiple times, screamed when powerups happened, teared up when the show made me tear up, and certainly, grieved when episode 366 ended. Now all I'm going to say is #BringBleachBack and read what's left out of the story in the Manga in anticipation, hoping that one day I'll wake up to the news of Bleach's continuation, or even better, a Bleach Brotherhood announcement.\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10):\r\nIf you're like me, having already watched both One Piece and Naruto, then what's stopping you from sealing off the big three package for once and for all? It is definitely the shortest series between the three, scoping only at 366 episodes. And if you're not much of a filler guy, you can cut them off and do with 284 episodes. WATCH IT!!\r\nAnd with that, I pay my respect to the series, the faithful fandom, and the man, the legend himself, Tite Kubo. I'll leave off for now with this.\n\n\n\n\r\n#BringBleachBack\n"
