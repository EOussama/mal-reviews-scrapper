    "content": "\n                It was probably all started when One Punch Man was the shit back in the day when it became so mainstream that all of our favorite celebrities unleashed their inner weeb and expressed how well received it was, and since it finished airing, a new yet familiar kid entered the hood, a kid nobody hinted at nor expected, but everybody ended up welcoming him nonetheless, enter Mob Psycho 100.\r\nThe series that we were blessed with and got so lucky as to receive two fantastic adaptations in between both seasons of One Punch Man, for many of us who thought that they would stick to MobPsycho 100 as sort of a drug to help ease the wait for the long wanted second season of One Punch Man, but when nobody noticed it, we were already so invested that it becomes that one favorite series that we hate to remember the motive we had to get into it in the first place.\r\nFrom the same author of One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, especially with it's off the chart new season blew all expectations and originated its own distinguished identity in the fandom, getting a cult following after a successful season, and to add to the spiciness, it was all well deserved.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nWe all know what to expect here, just the first season, it starts off very episodic with several self-contained mini stories that do contribute to the main story, suddenly moving to arcs that span two to three episodes until it's time for the fleshed out dude with all the messy details and the built up hype of the season, the one we conclude the series with and probably, hopefully, gets expanded on with another yet upcoming season (season 3 please).\r\nWell, it is definitely a generic formula that does work and delivers what it promises, it's by no means revolutionary or specific to the franchise, but this season, in particular, had something different about it, something that speaks to the viewer and involves him or her emotionally to relate to the portrayed moment, be it sad and devastating or bittersweet.\r\nWill a lot of these mini-arcs that debuted from the very first episode, we see an occurring theme that surrounds Mob in specific, it was all in the sake of teasing Mob, pushing him around trying to get him to that stage where he snaps and is forced to face what he truly is and as we know, he is somebody that's very shy and unsocial, he gets lost in his thoughts all the time and loses his focus when surrounded by other people, very specific themes that we all can relate to with a great emphasis on friendship and family, but Mob Psycho 100 pushes it to the extra limit, to the extreme borders of drama that know no end with a great coherent with the already fast pacing of the storytelling and you get yourself a heavily moving and involving plot that keeps you asking for me, something that's rarely even to happen.\r\nAnother very well-expanded upon theme of this season is the dark nature of one's self, how much can you take in before you totally say \u201cThat's it\u201d, a simple act of plot advancement that has produced one of my favorite episodes of all time where Mob is dropped int this imaginary pessimistic world that perfectly visualizes his worse possible scenario of life where it takes place on an ultra-conflicted dimension so on point and unforgiving that he's convinced it's the life he's always lived. Saying it was one of my actual favorites of all time might just be a bit of an understatement in Mob Psycho 100's defense.\n\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nSakuga heaven, what can I say, it is very rare that I'd get the pleasure to enjoy. In other shows, it's mostly hit or miss, you could get a 10/10 animated sequence to just sublime to a terrible half-assed excused to be called an animation for the rest of the episode, saying it's more of a slideshow than animation might be an understatement, that's a big problem due to uncostintancy. A show can be both visually gorgeous and honestly consistent if either one fell victim to luckster, then it's plain hypocrisy for the sake of the show. \r\nMob Psycho 100 surprises you with fantastic animation and keeps up the same pace throughout the run without showing any signs of laziness.\r\nLet's start with the questionable art style of the show itself, while a lot of people outside of the fandom might judge it to be too simplistic or overly childish looking, well, mistern or mistress, I couldn't be more in a disagreement that my hands are itching to throw a punch at your provoking face (For legal reasons that's a joke, so be at ease, I'm not that aggressive \ud83d\ude0a).\r\nMob Psycho 100's art style speaks its beauty through its fluid animation, a simple collection of not so straight lines can be much easier to animate than a fully detailed figure of solid mad muscle that could require a week of work for one second worth of animation. Simple math boys, less work per frame means higher production quality that knows its ABC when it comes to consistency, you know when a particular Anime cuts off its usual budget and downgrades its polish details that feed the art style in favor of a short fluid animated sequence, well, Mob Psycho 100 is just that, but all the time only it's not cutting any production value to downgrade the quality of the art style it's just that, and it's awesome. And it's more apparent in still shots when the so-proclaimed heavenly animation is absent, the imagery still looks out of the world, very stylish and original, cut free from your typical art style that almost 90% of Anime follow.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nWhile I don't have anything that amazing to praise in the level of the storytelling or the visual quality that offed the charts, vocally speaking,the show doesn't suffer from any below average performances on the voice acting side, all of the actors and actresses really put on their roles like if they were clothing, portraying just the right tone of voice to compliment the character's expressions.\r\nOne thing that we can all agree on is the opening song, and we thought season one's was the shit, while it still got its glory and praise, season two's opening is just a whole other level, there is a reason why the previous one is called 99% and this one is 99.99%, the name gives it off, their superiority isn't far behind, but the hype is clearly more on point on the latter. What else is there, the soundtracks are just drugs to your ears, there is something very oddly early about them, but they give off the same energy you see those psychic wrestlers display, you could almost carry up a fully loaded fridge and run off to top Olympus on a single breath while listening to its empowering beats.\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\r\nI personally don't connect very well with the cast of the show, but I definitely get the philosophy behind Mob and Reigen, Dimple is a cool one and so is Hanazawa.\r\nDon't get me wrong, the show is full of diverse characters, from the funny goofy looking to the badass cool kid, all with different personalities and screaming threats, I can see all of them highly individually loved with the fandom.\r\nOne great re*occuring theme in the season was definitely the relationship between Mob and Reigen as a student and a master, they knew some lows in between themselves that got even us the viewer to question both individuals' motives and read through they schemes trying to decide the one in the wrong. For more than ever, Mon has finally found more spotlights to hold and show his true emotion and carrying on the redemption he always wanted to share.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nPersonally speaking, this is the show of the seasons, there were alot of other picks that kept me on the edge f my seat week to week (Yakusoku no Neverland, Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen\r\n, Domestic na Kanojo, Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari...), but never as close as Mob Psycho 100 had me rolling over the hype, or burning in sadness due to the touching episodes. To a show that I watched the first season of and really enjoyed to yet bless me with an unmeasurable amount of enjoyment once again that it definitely ranked up in my top 5 all times favorites, it can't be stretched up long enough to show my real gratitude towards it.\r\nThinking back about it, it wasn't just the breathtaking fight sequences that could be put on their own separate sub-rank of visual masterpieces, but the splendid realistic flow of event that not only produced one of my favorites episodes of all time (episode 5) but also set up a new ceiling for similar shows to follow, this was definitely a one in a several years gem that nobody should skip upon.\n\r\nOverall (9.2/10):\r\nAs if I would have never gone through the trouble of setting my friends down to watch the first season already, this gives me a greater motive to get them into it that it should be a condition that should be met have somebody requested my friendship (Nah, just kidding about the friendship thingy), I'm very proud of the show for it to get to the rating of 9 on MyAnimeList and I hope it keeps getting the attention it deserves to someday rank in the holly TOP 10 list of all times.\n"
