Pretty much my motto whenever I'm in the seasonal train. \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d was the last Isekai that gave me a pat on the back and made me feel home around my Isekai hype again, I praised it on almost everything it presented, treated it like the pickle of the genre, the change we loathed ever since this mainstream pickle first debuted. A season later, \u201cTate no Yuusha no Nariagari\u201d had something else to say.\r\nSlime-kun was a relatively more creative and \u201cmore original\u201d take on Isekai, however, the Shield Hero nailed some stuff that even thelatter couldn't touch upon quite right, that is, proper character development as far as the protagonist goes.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nSummoned to another world (I'm sure we all know this part of ever Isekai better than we know the back of our hands), Naofumi and three other dudes are tasked to save the world they never asked to be involved with, with that being the only way they can go back to their worlds.\r\nThe story at the very beginning is just as generic as every other Isekai, the dudes get an explanation how this new world works, assigned a final goal each, and an unexpected turn of events unwraps. And with it, from the exact first episode, you get a fuzzy full-image of what the show could be like. Character development the likes we've not used to, especially at the very start of a series.\r\nThe very concept of stripping away every shred of power, dignity and pride from a character and then sitting through a full season of observations of how he overcomes all the odds really pays off, the pacing doesn't fall short of delivering a nicely timed sequence of events that help build what he lost back little by little, it's the same sense of achievement Slime-kun had all over again. Only a bit more satisfying.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nIn terms of visual fidelity, it definitely did not pull anything near the likes of \u201cViolet Evergarden\u201d, the art style and artworks look like any other Isekai, to be honest, just a modern average designs that fall back into using CGI very often for both background and characters (not a fan of that), it felt lazy at times, but when the action called for it, there was some strong Sakuga rage on the screen.\r\nThe character designs were blunt, only the heroes and important figures felt a bit more highlighted, probably thanks to the cool armory they were equipped with, pull that off and they look like every other fodder NPC.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nLet's just say that the first opening theme song was an absolute party banger. As for the second one, not on the same level, unfortunately, but instead, we got 2 gorgeous ending theme songs that really makes you think back on the burdens that have been projected on Naofumi throughout the story. They also make for beautiful lullabies on their own.\r\nThe sound acting I could say was amazing. I wouldn't ask for any better for an Isekai. A lot of emotion that had to be delivered, and the actors and actresses did not disappoint.\r\nThe only thing I felt a shortage of from what concerns anything vocal was the soundtrack, literally, the highlight of every MMO game (The selling point for these type of shows) is the memorable relaxing OSTs, sadly, the Shield Hero did not have a strong arsenal of that. It would have definitely made something good greater.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nYes please, my absolute favorite part of this show. Talking directly about the protagonist here. Naofumi started as the most clich\u00e9 Isekai protagonist the first shot he was introduced. Very naive, hype-active, go-lucky, but that changed faster than a blink when he pulled a semi-emo-edge lord transformation (for the right reason).\r\nRelatively, edgy characters don't tend to be the best ones, it has become like an excuse for obscuring characters and saving off an effort that could have went into expanding on their characteristics and treats, but not in this case, which I found very unique and different.\r\nSadly, not every character gets the same treatment, however, a large amount does by the end of the series and throughout.\r\nIf you like your fair share of Waifu and characters to protecc, you can definitely find yourself home with this show, I can't speak of much, but Raphtalia takes the cake in terms of popularity.\r\nOne of the most hated characters, like ever, makes a debut in this series, I find it a good thing for the kind of role she fills, she is supposed to be hated, and you can't help but find yourself on the verge of starting a cult dedicated to on purely directing every shred of hate to her.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nIt was definitely a turbulence in terms of sheer enjoyment while weekly watching the show. I can say with confidence that not all episodes are equal, the first 4/5 episodes were absolutely God tier, they give you an urge of settling with an overall score of 9, 9.5, or even a solid 10 (if you're feeling too generous), but it went kind of down after that on an average production rate until the 21st episodes, God that's another unexpected Godly episode, the likes of which that makes you put on another perfect score from what is presented of satisfactory execution, only to steep down a bit until it concludes. Those episodes were truly some of the best I've seen, and had it been as consistent throughout the serialization, it would have been one of the best adaptations ever made. No doubt.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\n\u201cTate no Yuusha no Nariagari\u201d, I can say with a smiley face, it was an absolutely refreshing experience for another seasonal Isekai, a lot of people may flee, only to realize the greatness they missed. It's not the best over-grounding story out there by any means, but if you're looking to be entertained and invested in the vast lore it houses, ripping your hair apart as you hate on an absolute slutty which and rooting for the Shield Hero to restore everything he lost.\n"
