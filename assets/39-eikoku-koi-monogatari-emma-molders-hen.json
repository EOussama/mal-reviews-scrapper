At first, I didn't like the art style that much, but later, I realized how fitting it is for this kind of stories, It really really helped evaluate the plot in some ways,\n\r\n-Characters (10/10)\r\nFinding a show where all characters are individually unique is very very hard, most of the time you are concerned about the main characters and their struggles, but in this story, you seem to have interests in some side characters too, for example, Steeves, Al, Monica, and so on, the support characters are just as interesting, Hakim, Grace...\r\nAs much as I hated Viscount's ideology, I find him to be a fit antagonist to the series, with his hatred and ego topping even his fellow class members\n\r\n-Music (10/10)\r\nDon't you get me started on this one, The opening, the ending, the OST are just awesome, I find myself get moved only by the soundtracks that are played accordingly and perfect, they reflect the scene's mood, and help let you reach the characters' feelings and thoughts\n\r\nOverall, This is a 10/10 show, I'd definitely recommend it for Romance stories fans, I just highly praise it for what it is, I remained pure and innocent, true to its self till the end.\n"
