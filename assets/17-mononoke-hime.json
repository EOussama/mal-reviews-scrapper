This is a story in a timeline somewhere before the big jump ofinventions, around feudal Japan era, you have your mere humans, looking at natural resources the look of a gold mine, and on the other hand, nature itself has its guardians, beastly huge talking animals, that are referred to as Gods, all they do is practicing what you'd expect from mother nature reflexes, they are angry, and very furious against humans, that they are on the verge of a great war between the two classes.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nThe story starts typically, with our protagonist, a prince called Ashitaka who is faced with a threat of death, caused by a curse that was cast on him upon making contact with a daemon, as for, he was set to travel, and look for a cure, along his way, he meets lots of people, made friends and foes, and has set himself a goal to stop the war between humans and the animals. As you might expect, every prince needs a princess, here came princess Mononoke, thus the movie's title, the two humans yet very different individuals both culturally and morally learn more about each other's environments, they grow fond of themselves, and more importantly face off the wrath of Gods and Demons.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nThe animation, seeing how this was made back in 1997, a year older than me, looks amazing you can almost taste it. the production team made a splendid job with the lighting effects, and reflections as well. there were a lot of complex fluid animations displayed too, which today's studios would have used CG to accomplish them, and they would still look terrible, the backgrounds and environment look very astonishing, the way how leaves dance on the wind is unreal, most definitely, the biggest point in this animation.\n\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI'm not the greatest \u201cwhat you would call\u201d music master, but the tracks in this movie feel really nice. some of the emotional ones even helped blend the moment with the message displayed, makes you very reachable to the characters and their struggles, the same is said about the sound effects, they were really good, especially the arrows bumping into currents of wind before reaching their target.\r\nAnother thing was the voice actor, well, now, I watched the English DUB, and I'm not complaining, the only down thumb for me was the protagonist's voice actor, for the most \u00e2rt, it felt very lazy and sleepy whereas he should have been the least a bit excited.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nThere is nothing to see as a role model for other characters but at least it doesn't have any might-be-called annoying characters. most of the characters feel like actual humans you can relate to, they think realistically, that you are deceived they are someone you might ore likely know. another side is the character development, people change, and so do the characters in this movie, the people you see at the early parts of the movie, are completely different from the ones at the end, they adapted to what happened throughout the story, and grew even more mature.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nNow, I really liked my watch, 2 hours had passed, and I still haven't moved from my place with how much invested I was in every frame, for the most part, that was the work of the astonishing visuals, but other elements shine as well.\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nup to this point, I haven't been disappointed by any Ghibli film, and I hope it keeps up this way, this movie set up a ceiling for others to come, now, should you watch this one? if you have a couple of hours to spare, it would be a shame to pass on it, grab some popcorn, spread your legs, get comfy, and watch this great movie, have fun!\n"
