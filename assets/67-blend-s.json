Those caf\u00e9s are more appreciated for their atmosphere and special customer service which make you feel like a legitimate duke being served his afternoon cup of tea.\r\nBut, of course, everything can be parodied, or at least copied to an extent. With the rise of Anime, Otakus were flooding from nowhere replacing the stereotypical millennials demanding a freedom of speech for their fresh odd tastes, and so there was an explosion in the medium of Otaku caf\u00e9s where waitresses andwaiters (mostly waitresses for reasons) cosplay as a specific Anime character and server their customers on a more Anime-like way. That intro took long enough. \u201cBlend S\u201d is a wholesome slice of life light-hearted comedy show with 12 episodes that expands on this idea. But instead of experiencing the life-changing experience (according to Weaboos) that is being in on of those caf\u00e9s, and keep in mind, it's past 2010, so as most people enjoy looking at other people play games, you could possibly get an enjoyment out of seeing imaginary customers being served the traditional Anime way. Or maybe, you know, enough of imaginary things, and actually go outside and make some actual friends. If you'd rather not, then stick along the review.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nSakuranomiya Maika, a high school student with charming black hear lacks confidence in her casual smile as referred by pretty much everyone to be vicious, and that of a sadist, having spent a long time looking for a part-time job but with no luck whatsoever to be accepted in one. One day while she's running to catch a job interview in time, she dumps into a foreigner from Italy, that's where she met her new job's manager, Dino. Well, lucky her, she gets recruited into an Otaku caf\u00e9 called \u201cStile\u201d where all the waitress are supposed to play a stereotypical treat from the wide weird world of Anime, and she just happens to put her sadist smile into work, and be the sadistic Anime character that disses and humiliates customers out of service, I know, I also have an exclamation point of view on these type of fetishes myself. The story plays out nice and at a considerable story progression that gives you something out of everything. Fanservice is, of course, present, but thank God they weren't suggestive with it, so rare and knows its time that it lets you beg if there was more. Along the way, the manager struggles to spend time with Maika who he develops a crush on, but thanks to their strong friendship bonds they make it out of every other bitter-sweet day of work.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nThis is one type of animation that I really enjoy. On wholesome and quite slice of life shows like this one, you don't really need the near perfect fluid animation to keep you focused as it lacks punch exchanges and epic bullet time stunts. All you will ever need is a clean, well maintained and consistent art style, and that's what Blend S delivers on. The color palette, for instance, is very vibrant and open, you see a variation of tints all at once, for each character theirs, no gloomy lighting or dark lazy colors, everything from the hair or the shiny eyes feels full of life, and compliments one's characteristics and treats. The alteration between the main art style and its respective minimalistic chibi version is only fermented by the smooth translations between serious and comedic conversations.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nIn general, the voice acting cast did a great job. So as lovely as the character designs are, they get cute feminine voices to add the topping on an already tasty looking cake (No sexual meaning after this). There were some near perfect English lines here and there that weren't worth the cringe shivers at all and were actually above average from what you'd expect from Japanese voice actors.\r\nThe opening and theme songs were just as good, speaking about the opening in more specification. After all, it's thanks to it we got the legendary \u201cBlend W\u201d parody that makes me shed tears every time I listen to it, if you still haven't seen it, then you're missing a lot, but just don't fall under the mistake of seeing it before you get familiar with the show's opening, that would sure give you some nasty nightmares.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nThis is, for me at least, a rare moment, to find a slice of life with no annoying characters is just glorious on its own. I enjoyed every single character and what it had to offer. With Stile being an Otaku like caf\u00e9, it presented a fitting roaster of employees, first you have the sadist Maika, and then the Tsundere Kaho, then enters the young sister Mafuyu (an actual adult in a loli body, so you're safe their boys), there is also the big sister figure Miu, and lately, the surprise character ;) (I know some people aren't going to like this one, at least I didn't), Hideri. And with that we conclude the female employees, leaving the manager Dino, and the chef Akizuki.\r\nWhat's great about these characters is everyone is unique, every character has at least two episodes centered on them, giving them the leading spotlight to express on themselves, leaving at least compatibility with a possible pair from the other side, which starts a cult of shipping very early on.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nSlice of life anime should all be enjoyed the same, that's a type of shows that isn't meant to hype you up or anything, but rather to enjoy while you're chilling after a hard day of work or school. The show addresses a lot of problems with its character, resulting in a variety of topics to discuss each episode, which doesn't render the events predictable and repetitive. I had my couple of laughs along the way, I shipped the two I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed in anything the show fails to deliver upon. Not what I would call a yearly-rewatch material, but it wouldn't hurt to see it with another friend.\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\r\nYes, aside from the memes, which in this Anime's case are dead (sorry for that, but facts are facts), you should probably clear some time and give \u201cBlend S\u201d a try. It's not by any means some life-changing experience Anime that you must see, but it doesn't fall short from entertaining you, which is a rule of thumb of every show. And rest assured, the content is (considering there are few sexual sighting and references) semi-family friendly that you could recommend out loud without having fingers pointed at you.\n"
