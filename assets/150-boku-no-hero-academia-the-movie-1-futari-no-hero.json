This is a crucial move to do as it can be the defining factor of a lot of potential fans to get in the show and many franchises fail at delivering the awaited experience. And it was about time \u201cBoku no Hero Academia\u201d made that move,and it scored like a Detroit Smash.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nA lot of Movie adaptations of already established shows, be them great or not fall short on keeping on the same track and reserving the identity of the parent show as they carry on Movie's original story, and it ends up with either creaking plot holes or being anything but the original show it stands in the shoes of.\r\nThe story of this movie feels like something you'd get on a canon arc in one of the seasons, it discusses familiar problems to the show and tackles everything carefully so as not to contradict the main story.\r\nWhat started as a fun trip to a VIP party that had all of class A present turned out to be a planned heist on a large scale that put several hostages on the vacation island in danger, until, of course, the day is saved by our boys and girls, a pretty linear and self-contained plot to sit through in an hour and a half long seat that doesn't bore you due to the great pacing that shifts the focus around so as to limit repetition and grind and take carry in the important part of the story.\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nAnd we thought some of the fights that lasted at best 10 minutes in the parent series looked this good, a movie really does bring the best quality in term of visual production.\r\nSharing the same studio as its parent series, Studio Bones, the art style didn't differ at all from what we're quite acquainted with, but we do get quite a boost in fluidity in animation, it was like upgrading from an old gen console to the latest beastly gaming computers in the market.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nThe voice acting cast behind the characters in \u201cBoku no Hero Academia\u201d have always done an exceptional job at performing the emotional and crucial moments of the story, the cries of a desperate teenager or the screams of a doomed victim, only your ear can truly appreciate.\r\nI'm very glad that the original soundtrack was still present and with an extra emphasis on how much action the movie had packed up.\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\r\nThe movie had some pretty interesting characters involved that related to All Might's backstory way back before his debut as a pro-hero which alone helped explain a lot of questions that the main story asked. Dr. David and his daughter that aspires to be a great doctor just like her father are both the first characters aside from Deku that we come to know are quirkless which puts a lot in common with our already protagonist, Deku, and these new faces that ARE a protagonist in this movie.\r\nI kind of wanted a lot of involvement from the rest of class A, but as always, Deku took all the spotlights as a jerky main character and the rest ended up being kind of neglected in comparison, going to an extent of only featuring some of them in a mere 3 seconds or less screen time, not a cool move at all.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nWatching the first movie of a great series was a blast, experiencing a new take on the show that feels like starting off fresh from zero but not at the same time, the fights were amazing and the action kept consistent all the time.\r\nThe flashbacks involving All Might are something the main story lacks the most and being able to see some of them in here was just so worth it.\n\r\nOverall (8.2/10):\r\nJust watch it, and dare I say, even if you're not caught up, it does spoil some minor details, but unless you were super attentive to the dialogue, you won't even notice, it was truly meant to be that one movie that gets people into the series without showing too much.\n"
