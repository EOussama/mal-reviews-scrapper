    "content": "\n                Sometimes MAL makes you watch the most pointless abominations that you begin to reflect on your own choices in life instead, and these shorts were one of them. It's either awoke and fifth wall breaking message, or just a pointless slideshow that was probably sponsored by MS Paint and directed by elementary school children on a very bad fever.\r\nNothing helps but the short length of the shorts. The vocals are absent, you only get a handful of cartoony sound effects at a time. The art is a soulless spooky and annoying to look at drawings that I could have sworn were made by a 1995version of MS Paint, and even after that went through the process of more pixelation. It did not help with anything.\r\nThe jokes are mostly one-liners that reference few highlights from the second season of the show, very doll most of the time, I only to crack a faint mumble after dropping my guard.\n"
