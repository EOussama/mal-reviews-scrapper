Of course, the best way of experiencing One Piece will always be, episode one, or chapter one. Not other viable \u201cbetter\u201d shortcuts to be honest, however, for the fans that like to a refresher on the series every once in a while, recaps like these are always welcomed, no, almost sought in desperation.\n\r\nAs a recap, it is, well, meh, but the stories told are ways the finest. You would be expecting to see something new added as a thank you for watching topping, but the same contentyou watch in the first 5 episodes of the series is what you get, only condensed in 24 minutes, with the same old animation, voice acting, and a touch of extra narrating from the original cast members. And don't take this as me bashing One Piece's animation, because even when it first started, it was a special kind of SPECIAL.\n"
