Demon Slayer taught us all a lesson, a mediocre story can lead the top of charts with a single consistent and high budget adaptation, however, not only did Jujutsu Kaisen follow on its steps, but it had a better grasp of itsplots and characters.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nAs far as the season got, the story still foggs off the premise it tries to present, it has a sense of great progression but at the same time, it feels like everything is frozen in a time-capsule.\r\nThe events tend to move at an astronomical speed almost feels like skipping on important stuff but that also leads to short, concise arcs that never drag or get bland at all. I can vouch that Jujutsu Kaisen is by no means a storytelling masterpiece, it remains as simple as one can grasp while half-asleep and redirects all extra buildups to the characters instead. It's crazy how the show can make you feel mixe vibes between early Naruto and Bleach while also maintaining its very own identity with a unique power system that feeds off from HunterxHunter's excellent take on power scaling and battle composition.\n\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nOnly a mad man would give this one below a perfect-10. Very clear to the blind, a lot has gone into the visual fidelity of this show, lesson learned, Demon Slayer. The show can feel very wholesome and calm with the incredible use of lightning and bright colors making you believe you're watching a relaxing slice of life only for it in a moment notice turning off all the sweet lights and effect, casting everything under a rusty dark shadow that feels out of a Saw acting set. The atmosphere delivered is just incredible, very believable, and almost a breathing character of its own, whether it's in the heart of a non-where forest or miles underground too deep into an abandoned sewer system, the vibe of danger always wraps the characters involved, always upping up the stakes.\r\nThe animation that goes through every fight scene was in a league of its own in this season, with amazing choreography and dynamic camera movement to the point of a simple eye reveal being better animated than 80% of the airing shows.\n\r\nSound (10/10):\r\nAs mesmerizing, the animation was, no one can simply gloss over how equally astonishing the audible capabilities of this show were, a work of art.\r\nLet's talk openings and endings, not a single one, no, not a single second one any of them was below amazing. The first opening won the fandom by the first screening. Then the first ending song followed with no breaks in between, breaking the meme economy and inspiring countless covers and spin-offs and it did not stop at that, the second opening and ending were impossibly just as good, that is a feat in an of its own.\r\nThe voice acting was also that good, it really felt like a high production show just from the main AND side cast alone, starring several big names in the industry. I love how the show broke some conventions that we rarely see happen, including English rap into its wide OST collection, not shying from building up to its hype.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nIt feels so suffocating not to give this one a third 10/10 in a single row, the only reason being, bad and boring villains.\r\nWhen we talk about Shounen, it's an iconic thing to have the first batch of villains memorable and fear-inducing enough to motivate the characters in the early stages of the story, unfortunately, Jujutsu Kaisen misses badly on this one, especially with Mahito who gets an insane hype built around him only to turn up as an unappealing try-hard that does not check any of the boxes of what an incredible early-game villain should.\r\nOn the bright side, the main and side cast are just starting on their own, not a single character was introduced turned up to be forgotten an episode later, they feel like real people, they have motives, backstories, and charisma fun enough to make you wanting more.\r\nOne of the best things about this show is how amazingly the female characters are written, some of the best that sprouted from a Shounen series, I have yet to see a female character sexualize and low-balled enough to be utilized as generic comic relief. Strength and badassery favor no gender in this show and that alone is very refreshing and worthy of praise on its own.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nAs much of a great show this was, not a moment of dull content was experienced, however, there were too many things left unclear that impacted my enjoyment of the series. Maybe a sequel will help clear things up, but for the moment, a lot of plot holes if you will have been bothering my enjoyment, but the show already checked on some of the most important elements that make a show a great and iconic one, this is a show that will keep being talked about for years to come.\n\r\nOverall (8.8/10):\r\nI don't know how the amount of hype that followed the series from day one did not make you curious enough to check out the show for yourself, but here's another reassurance. I don't recommend anything on a whim, not even a 2 minutes long Youtube video, but this is definitely a show made to be recommended.\n"
