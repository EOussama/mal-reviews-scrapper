One Piece Fan Letter is exactly what it would look like. Adventurous, larger than life, brutal, and depressing. An exaggerated interpretation of our own world.\n\r\nI feel like mentioning Ishitani\u2019s name should have been enough to relay the weight and classiness of this masterpiece, butman, that does not do it justice. The direction, the animation, the auditions, the storyboarding, everything, the whole package is PEAK incarnate.\n\r\nWe go through the lenses of different characters through some of the events of Marineford and the day the Straw Hats reunited on The Sabaody Archipelago two years later, a few whimsical characters get tangled up in the whole thing and steam the spotlights along, a unique take on what many would call \u201cfilter\u201d.\n\r\nA very cartoony and bubbly art style was utilized, the same one used for opening 26 of the Anime and some parts of egghead, it fits Oda\u2019s vision the most out of all other art styles used in the lifetime of the show, it makes you wonder if Wit\u2019s The One Piece adaptation is not on similar grounds then we do not want it.\n\r\nThis was such a timeless short, one of those that leave a mark and you\u2019d no longer the same person as before watching it, or at least, your view on One Piece will never remain the same. It\u2019s a world that\u2019s lived.\n\r\nOverall: 10/10.\n"
