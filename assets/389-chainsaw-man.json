It was a nice change of pace. I was never a sucker for \"Chainsaw-man\" when I read the Manga, but the Anime ultimately was the better version of the story, and that rarely if ever happens.\n\r\nOne of the things that I really appreciated about \"Chainsaw-man\" was the way that it blended together a variety of different genres and themes. The show has elements of action, comedy, and horror,and it does a great job of balancing these different elements to create a cohesive and engaging story. The characters are all well-developed and likable, and their interactions with one another are a highlight of the show.\n\r\nThe animation and art style of \"Chainsaw-man\" are also top-notch. The character designs are all unique and memorable, and the action scenes are fast-paced and visually impressive. The show's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with a mix of energetic and atmospheric music that helps to set the mood and enhance the overall experience.\n\r\nOne of the few criticisms that I have of \"Chainsaw-man\" is that it can be a bit heavy-handed at times with its themes and message. The show tackles some heavy subject matter, including issues of power and corruption, and it doesn't always do so in the most subtle way. That being said, this is a minor issue that does not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the show.\n\r\nThe music and voice acting in \"Chainsaw-man\" are major strengths of the show. The music, in particular, is a standout feature of the show, with a mix of energetic and atmospheric tracks that help to set the mood and enhance the overall experience. The unique ending songs for each episode are a particularly nice touch, as they add an extra layer of personality and character to the show.\n\r\nThe voice acting is also top-notch, with each character being brought to life by talented voice actors who are able to convey a wide range of emotions and nuances in their performances. The characters feel like fully-realized individuals, and their voices help to bring them to life in a way that feels authentic and genuine.\n\r\nOne of the things that I particularly appreciated about the music and voice acting in \"Chainsaw-man\" is that it feels grounded and realistic, rather than feeling overly exaggerated or caricatured in the way that some anime can. This helps to make the show feel more immersive and easier to connect with, and it adds to the overall enjoyment of the show.\n\r\nThe use of CGI is particularly noteworthy, as it is used in a way that enhances the overall animation rather than feeling like a substitute for traditional animation techniques. The CGI is seamlessly integrated into the show and helps to bring the action scenes to life in a way that feels dynamic and visually impressive.\n\r\nThe character animation is also top-notch, with each character being brought to life in a way that feels natural and believable. Even small moments of idle talking or casual blinking feel fully realized and help to bring the characters to life in a way that feels authentic and genuine.\n\r\nAnother thing that I particularly appreciate about the animation in \"Chainsaw-man\" is its consistency. The show maintains a high level of quality throughout its run, and there are no noticeable dips in animation quality or shortcuts taken in the animation process. This attention to detail is a major plus and helps to make the show feel like a fully realized and well-crafted anime. I mean, what next? Sakuga talking with impact frames? I'm up for that.\n\r\nOne of the things that sets \"Chainsaw-man\" apart from other anime is the way that it deviates from the typical seasonal formula and borrows from real world cinema. Rather than following a traditional episodic structure, \"Chainsaw-man\" tells a more continuous and cohesive story that is more akin to a film than a typical TV show. This helps to give the show a sense of momentum and keeps the story feeling fresh and engaging.\n\r\nAdditionally, \"Chainsaw-man\" borrows heavily from real world cinema, with a number of scenes and sequences that feel inspired by classic films. This adds an extra layer of depth and personality to the show, and helps to make it feel like more than just a typical anime.\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Chainsaw-man\" is a thrilling and entertaining anime TV show that is sure to appeal to fans of action, comedy, and horror. I would especially recommend \"Chainsaw-man\" to adult viewers, as the show tackles some mature themes and subject matter that may not be suitable for younger audiences. However, anyone who enjoys a good action-packed and character-driven story is sure to find something to love about \"Chainsaw-man\". Overall, it is a highly recommendable show that is sure to leave a lasting impression.\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\n"
