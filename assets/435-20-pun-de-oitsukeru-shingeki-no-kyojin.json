    "content": "\n                20 minutes to sum up the entire journey of Shingeki no Kyojin? Oh boy, buckle up folks because this is going to be one wild ride! But seriously, 20 minutes to cover everything from Season 1 to the first half of the Final Season? It's like trying to fit a titan-sized storyline into a small shack! I mean, let's be real, we all know the story of Shingeki no Kyojin is massive and full of twists and turns. So, while this 20-pun de Oitsukeru video may be a good refresher for those who need it, I have a feeling it's going to leave you wantingmore. But hey, at least it's better than re-reading the entire manga, right? Bt seriously, there are other smaller recaps for this series but with the existence of this one they all feel short of being obsolete, unless you're still catching up.\n"
