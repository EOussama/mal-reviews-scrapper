Specials give us something new but still remain quite as nostalgic and familiar, satisfying our hunger for knowing more about the beloved rich characters and making even more sense of the prequel. What we wanted from a sequel was delivered in a mere 3 episodes (approximately 30 minutes each) of content, and nobody's complaining.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nThese animations tend to dive more into the characters, giving them more depth and backstories, driving their motives out, and even giving them more treats and characteristics we never knew they had.\r\nThe specials follow the same path as their ancestor, jumpingback and forth between timelines and places, but this time around as we already know the parent story, it's not as hard to keep up with, the thing that made it really good to invest in.\r\nIn addition to the main timelines, 1711, 1930, 1931, and 1932, other time periods were added in a purpose of presenting certain important and influential past events that made a lot of sense of other stuff. It's undoubtedly the pairing and ships that were the focus of this specials, while they went through telling how the couples made up after the events of the main story, while also shading some light on other initial immortals that we never got to see more about them.\n\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nThe animation was decent, or a better rephrase, above average, nothing to complain about. I would argue that the main show did it best with better quality, but the fast-paced moments also retained their flashiness.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nThey went back at it again with the perfect accent of the era, you can't help but blend in with the characters just focusing on their voice alone, the music was amazing as always, you can never get fed up with the classic jazz soundtracks that kick in every now and then.\n\r\n- Character (10.0/10):\r\nBaccano! has always managed this on itself with no backing up, the characters were always interesting and engaging, you can help but side with both the good and bad people. but with this specials, they had a lot more to them to show, there was the focus on Chane, Nice, and Jacuzzi, now she got those burn marks and how he got his tattoo and what for, stuff like this really make the interactions worth it.\r\nThere was a yet astonishing maniac introduced that compliments perfectly Ladd, it makes you wish he was present on the Flying Pussyfoot and lead the action.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nI enjoyed this more than I accounted for, I signed in for a sketchy watch, thinking I would just be lost in a great mess again, but it really was easy on the mind this time around, feeling like having the ultimate experience.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nI bet if you enjoyed the parent series, and actually understood the story, that would be all the assurance that you have several affections to multiple characters, these specials where like an expansion pack with the greatest features you could think off to your favorite game, why miss on it if you have the time and energy?\n"
