Weirdly enough I feel like I\u2019ve seen way too many razor One Piece collaboration commercials, I always get the image of Zoro swinging a razor blade on an X pattern for some reason, I\u2019m pretty sure this commercial is not the first to do it. But it\u2019s such a missed opportunity to not have him handle three all at once and give his body a full shave.\n\r\nNice Film Gold acknowledgment. It feels like everyone is trying to make you forget about it when it was one of thebetter One Piece movies. If I was to get a razor from the ones shown here it would definitely be the Film Gold edition.\n\r\nAnd of course, Chopper is somehow there, canonically it shouldn\u2019t make sense but hey, the mascot must sell the stock.\n\r\nAlways lovely to see Law included. These commercials remind me of the weird period where Law was heavily involved during the Dressrosa Saga, nostalgic times.\n"
