After a successful escape from a certain death sentence, Kei Nagai and his new partner in crime, Kou Nakano, embark on a mission to seek revenge against the power-hungry Satou, who wants nothing more than world domination.\n\r\nLet's start with the pacing of this season. The first season was a bit slow, but this time around, the show really hits the accelerator. The action is non-stop and the tension is palpable. It's like they took everything that worked in the first season and cranked it upto 11.\n\r\nOne of the standout improvements in this season is the CGI. The first season had some questionable CGI moments, but this time, it's as if they hired a whole new team of special effects wizards. It's a noticeable improvement, or maybe I just got new glasses, who knows.\n\r\nThe characters are also more fleshed out in this season. Kei is still the brooding protagonist, but his character arc takes some interesting turns. Kou Nakano, who was a bit of a bland character in the first season, finally comes into his own and becomes the comic relief of the show. He's a \"fun\" character and his scenes provide a much-needed break from the high stakes of the story.\n\r\nAnother major improvement in this season is the added focus on high-ranking government official Yuu Tosaki and his Ajin assistant Izumi Shimomura. These two add a fresh dynamic to the show and bring with them their own unique perspectives and motivations. Tosaki, in particular, provides some much-needed exposition and adds a new layer to the already complex world of Ajin.\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Ajin Part 2, Ajin: Demi-Human 2nd Season\" is a vast improvement over the first season. It's got better pacing, improved CGI, more realized characters, and a stronger storyline. It's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the series and want to see where Kei and his crew's journey takes them. Just remember to buckle up, because this ride is about to get intense.\n\r\nOverall:8 /10.\n"
