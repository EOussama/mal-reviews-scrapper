    "content": "\n                The Ajin OVA comes as a delightful surprise to fans of the franchise, bundled with the limited edition eighth and ninth manga volumes.\n\r\nThe two episodes packed in a lot of humor that were surprisingly good. The first episode focuses on the infamous Shinya incident that was briefly touched upon in the first season of the parent show. The episode does a great job at fleshing out this important moment in the story, and provides great insight into Shinya's character. The second episode is another story on its own, but I highly recommend watching the latest episodes of the first half of the second season beforewatching it.\n\r\nThe animation in these OVAs is up to par with the quality seen in the parent show. The fluidity of the animation and attention to detail in character designs are both noteworthy.\n\r\nThe voice acting is on point, with each voice actor bringing life to their respective characters. The OSTs and sound effects contribute to the overall experience, and the opening and ending theme songs add an extra layer of excitement to each episode.\n\r\nThe characters are as compelling as ever, and the OVA allows us to see a different side of them. Sato's disturbing side and Tanaka's easily manipulated personality are both highlighted in these episodes, adding depth to their characters.\n\r\nThese episodes were a lot of fun to watch, and the humor added a new dimension to the show. The humor worked well and added to the overall enjoyment of the experience.\n\r\nOverall, the Ajin OVA is a great addition to the franchise, and I highly recommend it to fans of the series. The focus on Shinya's story, combined with the humor, makes for a memorable experience. If you're a fan of the show, this is a must-watch!\n"
