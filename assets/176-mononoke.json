An emotional slice of life show would leave as wiping tears after tears, and then there is the ecchi-heavy guilty pleasure show that stacks up to its name and deliver on the order of the boner.\r\nThose are some of the more mainstream universally enjoyed genres that have even inspired independent sub-genres to follow on their success. But often, a not too much talked upon and completely out ofthe mainstream realm, a show that breaks through the generic modern Anime formula enters the chat, but as disappointing as reality often is, it's never enough for the other counterpart to leave the chat, and probably, for the better good.\r\nNow imagine that more simplified this time around. \u201cMononoke\u201d is not your typical Anime show, it's more of an abstract painting, not everyone will be into it, but the ones who do like to really pose in a snobby manner and identify as those with a noble-class taste, because Anime is art, and it's second nature for any form of art to touch upon sensitive and sometimes taboo topics in the stranger and most domestic approaches there is.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\n By its very definition, \u201cMononoke\u201d is an episodic series that center itself across several mini-arcs that can be taken out of context and be watched as a completely standalone run, no arc is restricted by the one before, everyone has all the freedom to explore different themes and stories and oversaturate them with heavy superstitial influence that really speaks something about the traditional Japanese folklore.\r\n It seems that the right way to review this series is to dedicate paragraphs for each mini-arc as they stand, it's the way to properly honor all of them, but who's going to read all of that? You're probably just waiting for the bit that sells the show for you so that you can give it a watch (and please do), hopefully.\r\n A reoccurring theme between all of the arcs though is the inclusion of women as the main victim figures, be it an objectified, mistreated wife that gets all the trash-talking from her husband or a passionate newswoman that faces humiliation and failure in her career because she's a woman, those are the devastating ingredients that can push hatred to new levels so inhuman that Mononoke (ghosts or evil spirits) take part in the conflict so great that a mysterious medicine seller whom we know no name of steals all the spotlights and act as a judging narrator.\r\n Together with the medicine seller' skills and with the help of people who may or may not willingly provide their \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cregret\u201d to have a shot at the Mononoke at hand. The pacing starts very, and extremely slow at first, it can even span the entire episode that you start doubting the newly started arc from being any more impressive, until some sort of crazy revelation hits and it's all an intense war-zone-like battle of survival, the twists can really turn a slow and sometimes uninteresting story to one of the most intense situations you'll ever experience watching an Anime.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nNot only \u201cMononoke\u201d took an unfamiliar way to steer around its plot, but it also embraced the traditional abstract-y art style that feeds off of bright colors and a completely diverse palette. There is also a regular emphasis on a static texture that layers the final visual product which makes the whole thing look like an animated piece of painting, the sort of stuff you'd see at Hogwarts.\r\n As the show tackles some of the more urban cases from the Japanese folklore, the classic Japanese art spreads its claws remarkable and remains one of if not the visual selling point of the show.\r\n As domestic as it is, the visual approach the production team went with works the best in favor of delivering the perfect imagery of what a ghost sighting might look like, something very superstitious and out of the ordinary would only feel out of place otherwise.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nA Japanese visual masterpiece can only have the best as its vocal first-mate. Exciting OST that screamed of Japanese were all over the place, bringing nourish to the background and action, so calm and relaxing at times, making you feel at home depending on the situation, and so aggressive and reek of danger when the stuff hits the fan.\r\nFor a show about evil spirits and ghost attack, you bet you're going have massive scream storming at you every climax of an arc, and those were so believable that you would think they have gone through the trouble of recording real-life audio of some public freakout moment to feed the show off of. And that also includes the sound effect pack.\r\nI can't speak for everyone here, but the medicine seller did it for me, his tone of voice perfectly complemented the mystery his eyes bore,  how can a man be so into the moment but still carry on a calm and steady tone if voice, easily one of my favorite voice acting performances.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nAgain, the medicine seller, emmmmm \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c, yes, more of that please, I mean, it's just a refreshing experience to watch a confident, calm and mature protagonist contribute to his story without being a tiny bit annoying to overdoing it, the whole arc would pass by and you'd still not notice his presence all that much, he leaves all the freaking out to the participating people and takes the prize single-handedly at the end. He is just too perfect. And his design? Yes, that's what I call original.\r\nToo bad not a lot of other characters inherit the same merits as the medicine seller, and the perfect justification lies on the nameless title, we don't get a backstory from the guy, no motives and no clues on what goes in his mind, we don't even get a name, and still, he makes almost the entirety of the show by just being there.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.3/10):\r\nI was mistaken to jump into the show in a binge-watch intent, but I learned that mid-way. It really takes a lot of effort to follow along with the complicated cross-pathing plot of Mononoke, for it a story with a lot of inns and outs, I'm not surprised that if I ended up missing the bigger part of the series, only to recover that back on my future rewatch (which are mandatory at this point).\r\nI would start every arc with a skeptical look on my face, with extremely low expectations, and I would be damned if I didn't bring up the slow pacing that overwraps every beginning of an arc, of course, that's my first impression, but not until the stakes shift and I'm all mind-blown dancing of intensity and praising what becomes of the rest of the arc.\n\r\n- Overall (8.76/10):\r\nA definitive recommendation is what you'll get from me, the show does a better job at so many many aspects of basic storytelling that more mainstream franchises end up sleeping on. \u201cMononoke\u201d truely is a series that gives, and keep on giving.\n"
