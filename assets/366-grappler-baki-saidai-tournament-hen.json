Seriously, an episode could start with the referee declaring the opponent as a Sumo wrestler vs.some local amateur wrestling champion and still make it some of the most intense fights up to that point, it's simply a wonder for hype and build-up.\n\r\nNaruto part 1 Chunin exam is the only tournament that comes to mind that would hold a cancel to this, and that's saying a lot, but once the tournament wrapped up, it blew that out of the water.\n\r\nI thought I was so aligned and happy with the cast we got in part 1 and then this season introduced a whole lot of amazing characters plus reintroduce some of the most beloved old ones like Shinogi and Hanayama, man the rooster keeps growing and it's such a blast of nonending fun characters to see interact.\n\r\nThis season was pure fight hanger fest, and it was glorious, I hope it was longer.\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\n"
