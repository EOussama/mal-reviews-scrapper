    "content": "\n                Sports Anime are as distant from me as Anime, in general, was just 3-4 years ago, even now, it's unbelievable to me how many different shows and genres I got into in this time period, and still, no sports Anime was one of them, so when it came to it, Kuroko no Basket, a specific sports show that people pair up with Dragonball Z for some reason was my gateway into the genre.\r\nYes, indeed, I had a primary idea of the show as one where superhuman highschoolers pulling all the stops that would make NBA professionals look like amateur street-ball players. I mean, basic Animelogic, so it's no biggy, let's start.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nSports Anime were always a mystery to me, are they like drama that happens between the characters and whatever sports they are playing is just there to act as filler? That must be it, right? It can't be all games and matches of whatever sport they are playing, that would be boring, repetitive and badly paced, I mean, we're talking about similar games that take place in a pre-determined time period in a single enclosed place, just how are you going to create a storytelling device from that? Am I going crazy for assuming this?\n\r\nI totally was going crazy for thinking that.\n\r\nThis was a game-changer for me. Several games pre*planed to happen, all that's left to do is a few training montages and a lot of monologuing during the game, prior to every pass and possibly every brain-cell eruption. While that has a special charm of its own, it does suffer from the expected drawbacks you'd think it would.\n\r\nRepetition can kill immersion. Some games definitely feel like filler, but some others are built up intensely that definitely leads to a satisfying delivery. The pacing can really fall off, sometimes the dialog is just not that interesting, mainly over-reacting to every muscle flinch, you get the idea.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nIf anything, this show is a looker. Pure sport sakuga that gets your lazy body excited, pumps blood into your dead veins, and makes you want to pick up a Basketball and hit the nearest playground.\r\nWhen hands swiftly dribble the ball and the muscles fluidly shake off sweat drops, yeah, sweat, that disgusting substance that rolls out the eye is instantly transformed into buckets of confetti that compliments the scenery perfectly. The sight of danking, free playing, and epic sneaky passes are the right talk here. When visual storytelling is that good, it really makes your body crave the topic no matter how unrealistic it is.\n\r\n- Sound (7.8/10):\r\nI'm an audible homie, I love it when an Anime treats me to a good set of opening and ending songs, but Kuroko no Basket barely passed my picky quota. Just when I started getting used to the first OP, which is fantastic by the way, they introduced a horrid one that completely destroyed my excitement at the start of every episode, the song just didn't do it for me, or at least, its beginning. The endings weren't anything that sticks to the mind either, but they were fine I guess.\r\nThe OSTs, however, were balling, seriously, is this another Bleach? With the blood pumping sports-y moment, it hits right on the spot, or should I say, sound wave, when the right tracks play at the right time, it adds so much.\r\nThe voice acting was good, they definitely draw out the feelings of the speaker, although sometimes, crying over a Basketball game can get a little bit overwhelming.\n\r\n- Characters (7.5/10):\r\nProbably was of the most conflicting aspects of this show lies on its characters, in one hand, you have the main characters whose motivations and goals are as vague as Basketball's rule were to me prior to watching this, but in the other hand, the supporting cast is just right on point, dare I say, they single-handedly carry on the show even if Kagami or Kuroko were to never exist.\r\nKuroko, the dude whose name is titling the show is for the lack of better words, a dead mime, I've probably seen more interesting wooden planks in my years, probably the only thing that peaks the slightest amount of interest around him is how they keep calling him the sixth phantom member of the generation of miracles, the dude who the show is named after is carried by his old teammates whom themselves carry the show, I'm starting to lose touch with sense just writing about him. It's not that he is unlikeable or anything, it's more of how insignificant he is in front of every other character even though his protagonistic status.\r\nKagame too sufferers from this flaw, although, he does have a real presence that can affect their games drastically. Probably he would stand as a second Kuroko if it wasn't for their \u201cinvisibility\u201d.\r\nRiko is a fine supportive figure as well, her relationship with everybody in the team is something to praise, for once, I love a female significant character that's really there for the plot's sake rather than fanservice.\n\r\nThe rest of Seirin's team stand as great supportive characters, all feel different in the way they interact with the plot, they have unique treats and vibes, they add so much to conversations and overall don't feel like generic background crowd that was meant to just stand there as filler.\r\nThe generation of miracle members introduced in this season, Kise, Midorima and Aomine are just fantastic, really, probably the only remarkable thing that sells this show completely, their rivalry is more than a gimmick that's just there, it contributes to the plot and makes for most of the blood rushing moments.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI've never been big on Basketball before while acknowledging its popularity, I just never was in the right mindset to sit down and derive any sort of enjoyment from watching sain people dribbling a rubber mass around and sweat over it like crazy, that is until Anime normalized that for me, and it was none other than Kuroko that took that virginity away. And I'm not complaining. Hanging on the air for an unreasonable amount of second while stressing over lengthy monologues never sounded so appealing and fun to me, the matches kept me over the edge on my seat, the anticipation at every pass was thrilling all the while your villain of the week is steering around the stakes.\n\r\n- Overall (7.86/10):\r\nIf you're looking for an Anime-first sports show you'll be in the right place, wearing the right common sense proofing gear as this is as close to Basketball as Dragonball is to martial arts. It's too over the top that it pushes some realistic boundaries. With that said, if you're in the right mindset for that kind of shows, it doesn't take anything from the enjoyment factor, at the end of the day, it's epic Basketball fest that you're getting into and it's awesome.\n"
