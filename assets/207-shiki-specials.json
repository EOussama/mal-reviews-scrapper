But unlike the parent show, disbanding any minor or major drawbacks, weak character portrayals, and slow plot progression, they both go about two different yet related side stories of victims of the Shiki invasion. While the first episode takes the narrative on a Shiki perspective,they are both the verdict but also a victim of circumstance, going through the horror and regret that hey carry on their second chance of a life that's more dead than they were in their coffin, you get to empathize and show a soft side for some of the Shiki and actually partly blame the villagers on this mindless crusade that they made an excuse for bland mass murder.\r\nJust as you're about to take a side, the second episode navigates you through a paralleled perspective that shares the same decline, the same setting, the same crime, but its spotlights are on a different victim. A terrifying sit through how someone goes from being a loving, easy-going mother to a gloomy, scary-looking lady that you'd tell your kids to never approach.\n\r\nThese two coupled episodes help with the conflicted narrative of who is right and who is wrong. It feels that these specials are everything that the parent show wanted to convey, but miserably failed at, same problem different perspective was the way the series should have been, but instead, it was the same problem and badly communicated minds.\n"
