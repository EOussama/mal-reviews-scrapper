Mostly famous by its questionable first episode content that dove straight away into gore and rape stripes it equaled an atomic bomb for social media, there wasn't anywhere in the Anime community that this show was being talked about.\r\n\u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d however, has a lot more to it than that, and the controversial rape scenes are not its only selling point, more were they intended to be viewed that way.\n\r\nStory: (8/10):\r\n\u201cGoblin Slayer \u201d is a show about a guy who slays Goblins.\r\nNo seriously, an armored guy who doesn't take off his helmet for some reason, obsessed by slaying Goblins for noat parent reason at first, but we find out more about his motives as the story progressed. As to not spoil any further details, I'm going to leave it at that for the story.\r\nWhat's really fascinating about \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d is its massive world that we don't get to see, but from all the different occurrences and conversation, we assume its huge size, much like what made \u201cOne Piece\u201d so great, you can feel that the Goblin Slayer isn't just some distended superhero who was prophesized from the beginning of time, he's not supposed to be someone important or somebody that's blessed by the Gods, he's one weirdo in the eyes of other adventurers and that's it. As the main story progresses, we get to hear about big events that changed the world around our main characters, for instance, news about defeating some demon lord is out, you really get to see how much important that was for the people and how it manages to affect the main storyline with no direct interactions.\n\r\nArt: (7/10):\r\nI kind of see where they were coming from, it really is hard to satisfy all the fans when it comes to the animation part, so people would prefer the exact style derived from the source material, some other want something new to the table, but at least all of them agree on one thing, that is, CGI is forbidden. And that's where we were hit the hardest.\r\nI'm not saying that they overused 3D composition, there were very minimalistic when it came to that, but it was worth noting at least.\r\nThe animation remains consistent to say the least throughout the run of the series. The art style is sharp and very Isekai-ish on the surface, it really captures the medieval vibes really well.\r\nI can confidently say that I've seen better takes on this type of art, and Goblin Slayer while doing a good job to provide a stable art of decent quality, that's by 2018 standards (almost 2019 now) is mediocre at best.\n\r\nSound: (9/10):\r\n\u201cChained onto me, my adolescent dream...\u201d, man, those lyrics are majestic, without a doubt, best opening of the season easily. Thanks to \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d, I managed to discover the music band \u201cMili\u201d, and for that, I'm very thankful.\r\nAs dark as the show is, the opening manages to capture that on the right track and the lyrics couldn't be more on point `Slay the last of your kind, to reclaim what's rightfully mine...\u201d, there are just a lot of great quotes to get from that.\r\nI wasn't a super big fan of the ending theme song though, but I get the tone behind it, it's not bad per se, it's good, but not on the same level as the opening theme song sadly.\r\nThe soundtracks were some of the finest, for a dark series as this, you'd really want so tracks with a classic vibe to them, something that encapsulates the darkness of medieval era really well, and we were not disappointed there, there are just a lot of amazing picks to go through.\r\nVoice acting was another beard cutter (Pun intended) here. A lot of great actors came along, you can Goblin Slayer's manly performance that really can tell a story of its own just by listening to the resonance of his voice, all the pain and hatred can be felt from listening to any conversation he makes.\r\nAnd now for my favorite, the supreme waifu that stands above all, her voice is the strongest point about her, voiced by none other than Hikasa Yoko, the same legend behind Rias Grimory from Highschool DxD and other more, I don't know how she did it, but that voice man, it's so enlightening.\n\r\nCharacter: (6.5/10):\r\nThere is really not much to it, and I wish they could have fleshed out the main characters at least, but given the short and at the same time massive content they managed to pack in 12 episodes, that can be semi-excused?\r\nGoblin Slayer for one, as the protagonist has been given a lot of spotlights, and it's only understandable, we get to find out about his backstory, and man is it intriguing, they gave us so little on him and yet if put into words, you feel like that was some tons of information all at once, but really, we're still in the dark in a lot of related things concerning him, and that's one character alone. If only they could have done the same to more characters, because \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d (the series) does have a wide selection of truly interesting figures, and of course, it houses my all-time waifu, the great witch Majo, on man, I really can't get enough of hearing her delicate voice and her distinct pattern of speech, I can go all out fantasizing about all sort of stuff, but let's keep this review on track. I might just dedicate an appreciation session to her once a day from now on.\r\nOne really cool approach they went with as sort of leading the story on a third perspective view, that felt much like a first-person perspective, to be honest, and that's by giving the Goblin Slayer no obvious name, not only that, but his face has all the remaining mystery behind it, if at all, all we managed to see was the lower half of his face, it really made it seem as those MMO RPGs that put you to impersonate whatever character you want, again, it's not about the protagonist as an entity, but rather the story as a whole.\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10):\r\nOne thing for sure is, I never was big on Isekai and I only gave this a chance for all the hype it was given, and I can at least say that I wasn't disappointed. This was probably a trigger for me to go all out for other Isekai shows (Already loving Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken), it was an eye-opening experience that even put me in the spirit of reading the source material, and let me tell ya, I'm by no mean a Manga/Light novel fanatic.\r\nI'm sure as hell going to miss this series, and from what I've seen in the last bit of the last episode, a second season might just be upon us sooner than we might expect, let's just be hopeful.\n\r\nOverall: (7.9/10):\r\nThis show has changed my view on a lot of other series, not because it was some revolutionary pick or the first to do what it did, but that type of content, especially on this crappy PC age has kind of died out recently.\r\nIt was great to see something that gory and sexual that remains in the context of the story and that doesn't suck too much on the typical goofy Harem tropes that slowly start out giving you that Isekai vibe until it turns into a hardcore Icchi.\r\nGoblin Slayer was great, Goblin Slayer was really fun unless that is, you're easily triggered and or distributed by strong content, I wouldn't recommend it in that case, as it doesn't hold off one bit when it comes to that.\n"
