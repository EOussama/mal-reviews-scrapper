It broke records, hearts, and top-10 lists more than anyone can count and even today it remains as high ground as day one.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nProbably among all of Shinkai's works, this one has the most fleshed out and interesting plot by far. There is something verymagical and tragic about how everything was laid out from the first minute, not until the first third of the movie passed, we are still wondering about the mystery that seems to possess the consequential events, bit by bit, as you realize that things start to fall off the timeline, things happen out of the order, there is this eery vibe that drives the early part of the movie until it all hits and the supernatural element of the story unravels, by which, the intensity builds up and it's non-stop from there.\r\nWithout diving into any spoilers, the movie really takes its time building up to the climax but never does it feel slow or dragged out, even the famous clich\u00e9 Shinkai montages that highlight the passage of time are placed well and time perfectly that it gives off the perfect amount of anticipation.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nKimi no Na wa usually comes off as a benchmark when looking at something animation and art wise and it definitely did not earn this status from naught.\r\nBack in 2016, it was a phenomenon of animation achievement, no, it was magical, out of this world, and is still today nothing less than what it was on day 1, mesmerizing and inspiring through and through.\r\n Shinkai has proven himself as a master of his craft several times but it was with this movie that he broke records some of which he has set up himself and still to this day, several years later, nothing came as close as hyping up its animation to the same degree.\r\nPeople would get offended and involved in the never-ending controversies of mixing CGI with 2D animations but it was everywhere in this movie but never was it out of place or badly integrated, so much so that no one even realizes, like those meteor and stary sky scenes, just marvelous and on a league of its own. The character designs were alright, but it was the environment that took the cake.\n\r\n- Sound (10/10):\r\nAdding up to the incredible visuals, the music fidelity in this movie is just as astonishing. A lot of talent has worked in this movie but this department inspired a big part of this movie, from the top tier OSTs to the heart-felt voice acting that felt more genuine than real daily life conversations, it's a craft hard to pull off but Kimi no Na wa had all the rule of thumbs checked up from the first minute to the credits roll-up.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nA similarity that has always connected Shinkai movies was that the characters in question never carried the story but rather were carried by the flow of events too big for anyone to control. This shared universe between Makoto's stories is the true main character, sprouting several circumstances that connect nameless characters together and forms a comprehensive plot that manages to circle back on itself.\r\nThe fact that the movie is titled Your Name and the fact that the protagonists go on not knowing and/or forgetting each other's name just goes to show that they are in fact placeholder character that can be switched up easily and the story would still retain its intensity and mystery unscathed.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI loved sitting through this movie. I loved watching it years ago and I loved rewatching it now, just as impactful as I remember and with no signs of being dated by any measures, stilling the same old show ahead of its time in every other way, it is and will be Shinkai's masterpiece that even himself will have to surpass and it's not gonna be easy.\n\r\n- Overall (9.4/10):\r\nHonestly, for this movie to be recommended and viewed even by people who have no idea about what Anime is is reason enough to inflict curiosity and make you wanna check it out, heck, even if you've already seen it in quite some time now, it's a great idea to revisit it and look back on how your outlook on it has changed over time.\r\nI know a huge majority of people who dislike the mainstream or hate on something just for the same of hating do exist, but come on, until when are you gonna keep rejecting media that has the potential to become your favorite?\n"
