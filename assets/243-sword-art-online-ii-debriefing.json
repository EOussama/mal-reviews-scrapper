If I was watching the series weekly, well, by episode 14, that would be 14 weeks or three months and a half of slow-burn watching, I would probably need a recap episode to go through everything that happened on a said arc, or in other cases, if somebody was to take a break in between the arcs, a good recap episode would be amazing to refresh the viewer's mind and set them up to watch more.\n\r\nWell, I come from neither positions, unfortunately. When binge-watching episodes backto back, recaps seem to be a turn-off, so you'd really want to skip on them and win time. That is unless the recap has some fun twist around it, but in SAO II Debriefing, it was not.\n\r\nThe recap episode is a barebones retelling of the entire Phantom Bullet arc from Sinon's perspective, with some minimal narration at the beginning, ending up at when she finally overcame her hardships.\n"
