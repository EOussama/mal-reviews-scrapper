    "content": "\n                If you're here, you've probably seen Totoro and want to see even more Totoro, however, it might come as a shocker that this movie was almost singlehandedly aimed at people who complained about how little screentime the Bus Cat got. It's almost as Miyazaki is evening the odds for all kinds of fans of the movie.\n\r\nThe story at hand could slide anywhere midst of the movie's plot of sometime afterward, as Mei goes about a story of her own in the mystical world of  Totoro and friends. As she follows the dust bunnies around, she seems more and more from what the invisible worldaround her is like, meeting new friends and making more bonds.\n\r\nThe whole thing wasn't any big on dialogue, almost stands as a musical short side movie of Tonari no Totoro.\n"
