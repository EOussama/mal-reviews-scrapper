This song stands out to me the most because of how well placed and greatly timed it was as it suddenly starts playing and everything and everyone is just launched at this crazy chaotic energy, punches thrown from all over, clashes between hype characters here and there and then you have Uta nonchalantly going apes and bananas over this sick beat.\n\r\nThe music video is a very good representation of the madness and insanitythat was going on too, an accurate representation of Uta's rage.\n"
