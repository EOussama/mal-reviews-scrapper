Sure, it's a nice addition to the Slime franchise, but as a standalone commercial, it falls short. The animation is nothing to write home about and the commercial is far too long for something that is essentially just an advertisement. I've seen far more impressive wooden planks in my backyard.\n\r\nI suppose seeing Rimuruis nice enough for hardcore fans tho.\n"
