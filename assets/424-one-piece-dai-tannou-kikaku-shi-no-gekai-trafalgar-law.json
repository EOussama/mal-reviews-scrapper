    "content": "\n                Most of the recaps tend to be controversial episodes for the sole purpose of being released in the screening schedule of the parent show, they take up the time slot, delay the episodes, and slow down the progress. I get that, But sometimes, when you take time off, go tend to stuff in the real world, and then come back later, the recap can be a real bootstrap for getting back on the show.\n\r\nIn the case of the recap, the timing and release couldn't be more unfortunate, we were all hyped for Law's and Blackbeard's confrontation outside of Wano but then this recap hit uslike a stray bullet.\r\nIn retrospect, it's one of those rare episodes that are really good to watch as a standalone or even by non One Piece fans, it introduces Law and covers his bigger points starting from Sabaody Archipelago all the way through Punk Hazard, Dressrosa, and Wano.\n\r\nGood watch narrated by Chopper and Bepo.\n"
