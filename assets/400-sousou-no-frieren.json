Maybe it\u2019s stress, maybe it\u2019s carefreeness. Or maybe it\u2019s just not valuing time itself. But then again, life is slow, temporal, and sometimes horrendously mundane.\n\r\nOut of every possible aspect of reality or fantasy, Frieren: Journey\u2019s End, despite being set on a plane of fantasy, chose to tackle the very mundane life we so chose to escape from, making the passage of time as criminal as it can be, almost a character on its own.\n\r\nThere is a profound and interestinghuman condition case of study that the core theme of this show touches upon, but there is barely enough ink in my pen to write home about. However, it does not hurt to point a finger at how marvelously and magically the show makes the simple things matter, simple mundane everyday life tidbits that eventually add up across several years of companionship that make the strongest relationships shine in face of what seems like eternal slumber.\n\r\nThis show has a way with its narrative. On one hand, you\u2019re thrown into a fantasy realm with magic, dragons, tales, and demons, but on the other hand, you\u2019re just along for the ride of a slice of life, following the shenanigans of a very non-talkative elf that knows more about magic than formulating a sound sentence. It sounds like a recipe for disaster. That is until you learn that the fantasy does not matter as much as the slow-paced day-to-day ordeals that are not strange to even us.\n\r\nOne of the most surprising things regarding this show is that the production does not joke around, stuff of theatrical releases. I talking animation the likes of which you\u2019d see in movies, the pacing and direction leave a strong and lasting impression. The voice acting is stellar, emotional, believable, and engaging. The OSTs kick in at the right moments, the ambiance and SFX are just \u201cchef kiss\u201d. All in all, this show was an example of what a perfect Anime adaptation should look, sound, and feel like.\n\r\nWhenever there is a mention of \u201cslice of life\u201d, the same question is reiterated. \u201cBut what about the characters\u201d.\n\r\nFrieren: Journey\u2019s End places its characters at the forefront, it does not shy away from placing all of the spotlights right on them, it shows both the bad and good sides for all of them and dismantles the black-and-white facade that most people catalog different characters under. Rather than a gray bird view outlook, it\u2019s a mumbo-jumbo rainbow spectrum that mazes you around into guessing which is which until it laughs at you when you give up at the end because stereotyping is an outdated concept of character writing in this show, making it closer to reality that what you might think on a first look.\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard to talk about this show without letting too much out, so I\u2019ll say this.\n\r\nSet your expectations aside, for this is an experience that changes lives, depending on how deeply you look at it. It teaches real-life lessons and expands profoundly on the complex, but beautiful concept of legacy and companionship.\n\r\nOverall: 8.8\n"
