It turned up to be just a huge chess game, but boy has it been worth it, there is a lot of development as the story goes by, and there has been a lot of teasing on past events that really gets you hyped up to know more about this strange world.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nIs there anything else to say here? Like seriously, the most colorful world I've got to see animated, with the red color dominating, might seem a bad idea, but wait until you see the result, the animation was marvelous, character designs are great!!! But hey, It's Madhouse we're talking about, that's nothing strange.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nYes, you heard me, that was a glorious audacious ride, from amazing sound effects to fascinating tracks, the feels and emotions you get to experience from the songs alone, you don't get to experience such a well-composed track in all anime shows, but this one stands on top of many.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nHere where it sucked for me at least, besides Shiro and Sora, other character seemed so 2D for me, outstanding treats or interesting vibes around there, the relationship between our sibling heroes that share the name [Blank] was somehow explicit, the wincest was present on a huge scale, I guess considering the two, there was no remarkable character development, but not the same can be said about Steph, she, for the most part, had some character development although it's nothing too remarkable as well, she stood at as a fanservice doll, for the most part, talking about fanservice, this show was a train wreck for this, how is it rated PG again?\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThis is such a one-seat piece of cake, I, however, divided this into 2 days worth-of-watch, I got to know how much this show will be good from the first episode alone, so I decided not to rush through it, and take my time watching and admiring its aspects. I dove in with 0 expectations, I've heard of this show so much in the past, but the art somehow kept me away from it, now that I've finished it, I have no regret but the ordeal of wait, I need a sequel and fast!!!\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nI tried to be less biased rating this, I feel bad because this show could have been even more enjoyable if it wasn't for the forced fanservice, would I recommend it? well, it depends, are you the type that enjoys a fleshed out story about games set on a magical world? would you mind some fanservice along the ride? well, this is a good show for you.\n"
