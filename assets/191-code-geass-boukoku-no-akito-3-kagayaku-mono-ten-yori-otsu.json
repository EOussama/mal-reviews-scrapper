    "content": "\n                These movies/episodes keep getting better and better one after the other. It would have been great to have them release on a TV serialization fashion in episode chunks.\r\nThe animation was significantly better in this one than the last movie/episode, maybe because it wasn\u2019t as heavy on fighting? But damn did they do justice to the Suzaku showdown. I really loved the cameos of Suzaku, Lelouch and even C.C, it seems that the characters are deeply related to the parent series\u2019 on a level I did not account for.\r\nSeeing how Lelouch takes up a whole new identity between the two main seasons put a yet anotherperspective to the progression of the story, he really did get some behind the scene action.\r\nMost of the screen time was surprisingly wholesome and heartwarming, with the main folks hanging around small-time gypsies in the sticks, it was almost a different show altogether.\n"
