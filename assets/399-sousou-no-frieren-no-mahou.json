    "content": "\n                Having survived the horrors that are the endlessly horrible Code Geass picture drama shorts, I thought I was scarred for life. I would always consume the latter with a dissatisfied expression and a hardened core. But alas, this cute and bite-sized series of shorts came by me. And it was such a great breeze of air.\n\r\nIf you, like me, loved and enjoyed Friere: Journey's End, then I've got some good news for you. However, if not, then I have so many questions for you starting from what even got you on this page to begin with.\n\r\nCountless popular shows come with this type of special likesome late wave of marketing and keeping the hype alive for more potential profit later, they all pass off as generic, filler that's just plain boring and slow. However, once a red moon, (or is it a blue moon? Pick your color) comes a special drop of shorts that really do sell a unique vibe, and this one is one of the best ones I've seen in recent memory.\n\r\nCute Chibi animation, hilarious dialog, and short delivery made the watch feel like such a breeze that it wouldn't have hurt to have a dozen more episodes. And that's rare.\n"
