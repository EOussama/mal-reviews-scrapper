Back as in just another season, or back as in making a comeback of earning its merit back.\n\r\nAlicization was the game-changer.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nAfter seeing all of the previous installments, both season, the OS movie and all of theother shorts, I felt like I had already seen everything there is, SAO as a concept was good, while it lasted, what else could it bring to to the table, we've seen VR exploits, AR exploits, real-life convoluted drama, we've seen everything, or at least, that's what seemed to us, and then Alicization came.\r\nThe very fact that the name Alicization itself explains more about the season than I could ever do is amazing. Presenting a new spin on virtual worlds, or is it really? If dreams count as virtual, maybe, that is exactly the kind of convoluted questions the series pushes you into, and also, an underrated portion of it.\n\r\nThe plot kicks off in a very confusing setup, that slowly, but surely clears up the fog surrounding it in a very satisfying and comprehensive way, it tackles an interesting spin on memory manipulation, both clever and very uncommon in mainstream media, hitting off the same wave of high risks as the first season, with big challenges for the characters to overcome.\n\r\nThe story progression was surprisingly very fast-paced and action-heavy, a lot of info-dump episodes in between and a whole lot of friendship bonding. More than SAO or ALO, Project Alicization, even though not intended as a game, felt closer to being a perfect RPJ than anything previously introduced, the grind is very rewarding and contributes to the story, the lore and the surrounding world was massive and very welcoming, it keeps you wonder and ask questions, but never leaving you with no answers.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nA strange and yet welcomed change on the visual level has been the talk of many fans, for the better or the worse, I would say, it definitely takes after Highschool DxD hero with its dry, flat colors that seem to have a personality of their own, very vibrant and eye-catching.\n\r\nThe movements have definitely gotten an upgrade, SAO has never been so fluid, I don't think that even the movie OS compares to some of the stuff we get to see, truly a passion project.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nThere again, I was absolutely home when it came to the vocals. I would say, next to Black Clover, SAO has never disappointed in that regard.\r\nIf it's the openings you ask, endings maybe, OSTs, get your ears ready for the treat, absolutely a masterful bundle of ear-tingly runs, some big names were involved in this production, and it definitely shows.\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, probably better than anything we've seen from the series. Kayano, Ai, truly a highlight in this regard, she does Alice in such a perfect and faithful way, probably the best voice-to-character match in the series, and you gotta love Eugeo's big moments as well, as the cry baby he was for the longest time, his voice complemented that just good enough to high the spot. It was believable.\n\r\nFinally, this is probably the first time I praise this series about this specific, overlooked aspect, the sound effects. Last time I really fell heels over an Anime's SFX was with Fire Force, although the later is still superior in that regard, damn Alicization, you definitely came close.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nI never thought this series can grab my interest over the characters after seeing everything prior to Alicizeation, it looks like bringing along a full-on new cast of character was just the way to go.\r\nKirito, yet again, proves to be as adaptive as he was ever introduced as he bent very quickly and masterfully, I would say, even better than he ever did with the new faces of this season, and honestly, he hit his peak so far, and I can only wish for similar feats from him on the future.\n\r\nEugeo was just the companion to highlight Kirito's growth. 3 seasons into the franchise, it's normal to expect from the main character to have to grow some mass, on a character level of course. Thanks to Eugeo, Kirito definitely takes on more of a mentor/senpai role, he gets to share a great deal of wisdom and teach his friend(s) about all sorts of things.\r\nWhile accompanying Kirito, Eugeo too overcomes a lot of what held him back, going from a cry baby to an absolute beast in combat, from a naive clueless cowardly cat to a strong Aincrad-style representative.\n\r\nAlice as well, as suddenly introduced as Eugeo was, she definitely secured a high place in the black swords man's harem, making people even swear over her than Asuna. I can't blame them.\r\nAs little of screentime she had compared to Kirito and Eugeo, she definitely had a greater attachment to the grander plot, both as a goal to the other duo protagonists and a drive of the franchise from this point onwards.\n\r\nAnd last but not least, let's not forget the real MVPs of the season, Cardinal-chan of course, but most importantly, Charlotte the spider. There was a reason after all, why the SAO wiki changed their cursor to the cute spider.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nFunny enough, I never heard any words of praise over the third season before, or at least, not as much as I should have seen how good this season holds up. Maybe people just didn't want to say anything positive about the series. I'm hesitating probably, but this might as well be the best experience and the most fun I've had watching SAO, that or ti's going toe to toe with the Aincrad arc from season one.\n\r\nThe mystery and hype, the vibes, everything about what made Aincrad loved nad praised is definitely present in Alicization, I would say, ever more if we include the amazing spin on the whole Fluctlight manipulation which gives the series a great deal of lore that ups a lot of points in that regard.\n\r\n- Overall (9/10):\r\nAfter the abomination that was season two, well, I didn't use to call it that, as it was a decently compromised season, but after seeing Alicization, the poor thing got sandwiched between Aincrad and Alicization, faith was not kind at all to GGO.\n\r\nThis is a great season, no, an amazing one, definitely lived up and even surpassed the \u201cSAO will return\u201d phrase that I thought for the longest time was just another marketing ploy to get people interested in the release. I would easily encourage people to start SAO just so they can see Alicization in that regard. Truly a comeback to the franchise, setting new heights that I'm optimistic it will keep on delivering on. Hopefully.\n"
