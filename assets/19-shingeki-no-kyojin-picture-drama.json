    "content": "\n                Now, jumping into this completing with 0 expectations, not having watched any of attack on Titan in a very long time, also,n it's worth mentioning that even though I still haven't seen Attack on Titan: Junior High, I believe this one is a bit similar in nature, if not better, this show set a high ceiling for this type of content, so the next time I'm watching Attack on Titan: Junior High, it woukld be tough to compare to this one, now let's discuss some of the aspects of this show, shall we?\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nThe is no actual \u201cstory\u201d behind this, I never expect one,to begin with, it's just a silly rip-off the origin Attack on Titan series, more specifically, the first season, even more specific, the last 25 days before graduating from the academy, were we get to see a more slice of life side of the story, in a cute way.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nIt's not visually and fantastically appealing but god does it deliver what it promises, It's all about cuteness in this show, if that's your cup of tea, then you're in for quite the journey my friend.\r\nAll the characters are pictured in the chibi style, with very short cute legs, and puffy faces, you might not think this would suit characters like the ones in the original Attack on Titan series but was I wrong thinking so at first.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nThe show is filled with your typical epic Attack on Titan soundtracks, and let's not keep our eyes away from the voice acting, because that would be some of the cutest sounds you'll hear, god how I loved Armin's enthusiastic feel, and Mikasa's blunt yet cute screams, there is no opening per say, but I could consired the first 3 seconds ro so to be one, with a very hyped up chunck of music, I'm smirking right now just picturing myself hearing it out again, infact, that's the first thing I'm looking up on Youtube after I post this review.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nAll of dem familiar faces are present, only better, how? well, bring all of the Attack on Titan characters, go through them one by one, and remove all of their bad treats that make them unlikable, and there you go, I haven't found myself not liking any single one out of them, all cute and very likable.\r\nThe designs are just as wholesome, I would fantasize all day about stickers implementing them as the main focus.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nThis was a heck of a cute paradise, the humor is so subtle, very easy to follow, with some few references to the original events of the show, which only makes it even more hilarious, watching the whole thing, while still being very short, was a great wholesome experience.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nI would still not recommend this right off the bat, and also, not for everyone, if you are a die-hard fan, loving the characters, and wanting to see them do some more stuff, far away from brutal killing and massacres, then it's a show for you to both help forget about your favorite characters dying, that or just for the heck of a couple of laughs.\n"
