    "content": "\n                I feel like I've already put down enough paragraphs on what this show is back when I reviewed the first season, and to be honest, it was more of last year's hit, however, in honor of an honest series, another review is the least I can do to show my appreciation for a show that most people think of as a joke, but end up sleeping on a decent wholesome fest that doesn't get much recognition, if it doesn't have boobs it's not worth the watch, that's the phrase they live by, while agreeing as much as Dandy would himself, it's way too generic tospit it overflows many good shows as victims of lackluster and low following.\r\nRemember the thing about the futuristic civilization that will come to earth to find some copies of Pingu's first season and get a wrong idea on us as a capable life form? Well, scratch that, what if they ended up enjoying it as much as we did, and so as a tribute, they produced a new season of the show. Several millions of years later, yet another more advanced life form arrives at earth and manages to get by the remains of the last inhabitance of our poor planet, and ended up finding out about the new season of Pingu in The city. Actually, scratch that, I way off topic I should just stick to the review.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nFascinating how simplistic but very reflective are the problems discussed in this show. The episodic nature of the show remains as strong as ever with this season with a better topic to discuss, stuff like stealing, lying and all sorts of basic bad habits that the kids should be aware of and avoid are all adapted into their own respective episodes that go ahead and with a great effort show numerous examples of their causes and consequences and always ending up with a wholesome wrap up at the end of said episode.\r\nAs we've come to know, all episodes are extremely short, spanning around 7 minutes including both the opening and the ending which leaves us with a limited content that at the end of the day doesn't fall short on delivering the message. The show really teaches a lot of daily ethics that we forget about most of the time showing examples of their effects on a personal side (Everything related to Pingu) and on one's surroundings (Everybody else).\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nBeautiful spot motion that's simple enough to carry on the moral of the episodes. Its childish visuals still strikingly apparent but it was always meant to be that, you can't really complain about the fluidity of the animation of the alteration of the anatomy concerning body proportions, because at the end of the day, they are all just penguins that tend to have way more flexibility on their bodies than a world-class renowned gymnast.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nI think at this point we can all live by their constant span of \u201cNOOT\u201d and would never take anything else for a replacement, even if it was legit voice acting with big names taking on the roles. The dialogue was never relevant as the moral of the story was always the message, the actions that we physically do will never be excused by simply spitting some words, perhaps that was the reason for having all of the Penguins noot all the time.\n\r\n- Characters (7/10):\r\nThere was never a character that makes you go nuts on consuming all of those latest figurines the moment they show up, it's just Pingu, the dude that's all of the worlds is centered around. The show features a full sized city populated with a lot of Penguins of different treats and professions and never neglects a single one of them as all of them have episodes they shine on which is always appreciated. Writing up characters and never referencing again was always a bad thing, and \u201cPingu in the City\u201d addresses that greatly.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nThe joy of watching \u201cPingu in the City\u201d was always from anticipating what's the next ethic the episodes are going to tackle, I don't think binge watching this series works in a good fashion as watching it weekly does have its effects if you're planning to live by the great advice the show provides, a week worth of time between every episode could also be an opportunity to adapt to the moral lesson you just learned from Pingu.\r\nThe factor of wholesomeness is also something worthy of mentioning, I'm rare to find a show that genuinely helps you relax, it doesn't require any extensive processing to get and is just there to entertain you whenever you've nothing else to do.\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\r\nRecommending this to an outsider of the series might lead them to doubt your mental health in many ways, and it's sad to think that this is what the general public thinks of this show, no, it's not for a specific age demographic and was never meant to be, learning good moral is a great thing to live by and you could at least be appreciative to this new kid in the block that's willing to help up shape a genuine person out of you.\n"
