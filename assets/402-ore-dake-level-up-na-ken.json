    "content": "\n                I remember way back, during the quarantine, I had this very bad toothache in one of my wisdom teeth. You all know how going outside was not as simple as it is now, so I had to endure it for days long until I got an appointment and surgically remove the wisdom teeth once and for all. And then one of my buddies hit me up while hyping this \u201cManhwa\u201d called Solo Leveling. I, of course, could not give a bull for it as my mind was fully occupied with the pain at the time. But little did I know, a Korean comic would havebeen the greatest coping mechanism that would generously distract me away from the pain that I would eventually forget I had any dental issues and end up almost missing the surgery.\n\r\nSolo Leveling to me was a companion during a hard time, I had almost blitzed through it during a couple of days for how good and engaging it was. And then, the question occurred. When an Anime adaptation is issued, how would it play? Especially after the other Manhwa Anime adaptations (Tower of God, The God of High School, and Noblesse) fell flat on their faces. It was a genuine fear that the Anime adaptation is better off not existing at all.\n\r\nWe were afraid for nothing.\n\r\nThe Anime adaptation of Solo Leveling was a banger. The animation was done justice, which was the biggest fear, to be honest (the Manhwa remains to have some of the best illustrations in all of comics), the OSTs were fantastic, and the directing \u2026 well, it was not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. But still, it was decent. Different but definitely above average.\n\r\nAny avid Manhwa or Light Novel reader would tell you that this entire season was nothing but a prologue, it was all set up for what\u2019s coming, although, I would sit down my expectations and wait for the drop.\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10.\n"
