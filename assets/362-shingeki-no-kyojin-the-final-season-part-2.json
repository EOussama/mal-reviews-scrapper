    "content": "\n                Writing a review about Attack on Titans feels more like a declaration of war towards the fans, my assurance at hand, is I'm not here for slander.\r\nAttack on Titan is definitely a big recognized name in the field of Anime, some would say, it's the definition of a good, well adapted modern show, you've got critics praising it high and fans preaching it like the bible, but I never took the story as the evangelical type. The fandom always seemed to me like a cultish and uncharted sea that your grandmother would persist you ignore, but hey, let me voice what I think about theAnime itself and not the fandom.\n\r\nI'm a big Attack on Titan fan, I still remember back in the day, when the first season was still the talk of the town, I would speculate, chart, and debate myself even about future outcomes of the story, way back when it was still posing as an edgy Shounen bait, back when t was still compared to Naruto and Tokyo Ghoul, weird times, I know, but what we have today is the amalgamation of converging paths of decisions and detours that one would never have predicted. I'm been missing out on the \u201chype\u201d behind many of the big moments of the show, merely for the simple fact that I was watching with a group of friends that would gasp and scream at every line of dialog, completely ruining it for me, and thus moments like \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d and the entire \u201cgood\u201d part of season 3 part 2 feel like average midpoints in the series, I never look fondly back on them, they don't stand out in my memory at all, and what a shame it is, but this season, I took the initiative to watch the show on my own, at my own pace and alone, and what an ice breaker it was. It was like looking at the show from a different window.\n\r\nThis season houses some of the most balsy and risky storytelling decisions of any show, completely flipping the script on its head and then foot by the end of every episode. It left me questioning everything about every character, it changed my views of some characters I had given up trying to justify or understand, it redeemed a lot and resolved many knots that were boggling my mind to this day, especially a specific couple of episodes where everything's been laid down and for other first time, and the end was visible from where we are.\n\r\nI think this season ended the debate of \u201cwhich studio did it best\u201d, after all, the direction especially on certain episodes was all the fuss and for good reasons, it really shows how a good adaptation can brining out the shine more than you can anticipate from an already great story\n\r\nThis season was the breaking point between sanity and madness, it was the strip between law and chaos, it was definitely the season of confusion, all knots are tangled, all axis flipped the other way around and everything became so unpredictable, it reflects well on how high the stakes are, there is so much at hand than the big and complex conflicts that drove the series for 4 seasons is but a simple insignificant problems against a much bigger and tangled debacle.\n\r\nAttack on Titan really continues to rule its territory, there is nothing to be afraid of besides a good, satisfying ending, but that we won't know for a while, as said till now, it is definitely a pioneer in the field, an untouched king and a critic in and of itself.\n"
