Mainly, becauseof bad timing and inconvenience, you don't just get to have a recap for a season that is already scares on episodes (only 11), it eating air-time real estate for what could have potentially lessened the pace rush towards the end, although, there was nothing going to save this sorry sequel from sucking as bad as it did.\n"
