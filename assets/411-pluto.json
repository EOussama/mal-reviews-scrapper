    "content": "\n                It\u2019s such a shame that a free-form medium like Anime which allows for varying approaches to storytelling, to be so streamlined and limited to a fraction of what it can really branch out to.\n\r\nYou have all kinds of fantasies and epics adapted into a firm bundle of eye-ear-orgasmic animation and sound that draws you in like nothing else, but there is so little dedication to more realistic stories that grip closer to reality it seems.\n\r\nPluto, is, however, a grim detective thriller set in a sci-fi near future with real-world-like geo-political tribulations with a sprinkle of existential amalgamations.\n\r\nThe marine lens follows Gesicht, a top-of-the-line android detectivewho finds himself involved in investigating the murder of one of his old war pals in what was both bone-chilling and thought-provoking journey that challenged not only his \u201chumanity\u201d but also the human consciousness of the viewers.\n\r\nBoth the animation and sound design were world-class standouts, And by no means overshadowed the genius of the core plot of the show but they also remained a force to be raised on their own. It\u2019s one of those shows that give the feeling that you\u2019re not watching an Anime, and rather, a TV show that\u2019s more real than most live actions even are.\n\r\nWe can\u2019t talk about this once-in-a-decade masterclass without bringing the characters under the spotlight because they were nothing but exceptional. For instance, Gesicht and Atom are more \u201chuman\u201d than many humans in the show despite being robots at core, and it\u2019s not the cosmetics that sell it the most as much as their expressions and interactions do to the point where the fine line between a human and a robot gets so blurry that existential questions bring out themselves on their own under the form of real events that take precedence in the story.\n\r\nEspecially for fans of author Naoki Urasawa\u2019s other works like Monster. Pluto embodies his unique style in depicting a real-world-like narrative under such a believable image that it\u2019s criminal not to bring it up in every other conversation. This is a classic to be watched and recommended for years to come.\n\r\nOverall: 8.64/10.\n"
