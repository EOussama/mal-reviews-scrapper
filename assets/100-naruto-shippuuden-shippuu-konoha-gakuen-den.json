You'd think at first it would be like no other casual chapter read but it actually was better than having the whole thing animated and risk the probably bad animation.\r\nI really loved the slightly different feel of the art style, it appears to be killing the modern high school drama art style and worked surprisingly like a charm.\r\nProbably the greatestthing about this, and having the setting be a normal high school, the clothing was just a massive overhaul, it made all of them look like fresh characters from some other series, especially Naruto.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nThe voice acting was a whole other experience from what you get in any other Naruto animation production. As the panels go by, the immersion from the characters narrating their lines take you by surprise on how cozy their speech pattern appears to be, a lot of dynamic and un-scripted (although it was) on the surface, as if you're listening to some rural storyteller talking about one of his old adventures.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI loved the crazy references and the circle jerking they had going on about the main series. A lot of brilliant fourth wall breaking regarding manga references even. I'd say, the greatest comedic attempt Naruto has ever done brilliantly to let me genuinely let down some gags and appreciate what they were going on.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nI really, and strongly recommend seeing this as it offers a lot than a simple picture drama does by the words. Fan of the series or not, it sure has got at least a couple of laughs in store, and it's only 8 minutes long.\n"
