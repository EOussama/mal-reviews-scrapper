From the first episode, it's clear that the animation team really stepped up their game, with fluid and dynamic fight scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. The use of CG is also much improved, seamlessly blending with traditional 2D animation to create a truly immersive experience.\n\r\nBut the real strength of Kengan Ashura Part 2 is the characters. The backstories of the fighters are fleshed out in a unique 2D water paint style, giving a fresh and uniqueperspective to the show. It makes you feel invested in the fighters and their struggles, and the development of the characters is truly captivating.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget about the humor, the show does not shy away from it, it's full of muscle-head jokes, and it's hilarious. The way the show balances the humor and the action is truly masterful, and I found myself laughing one moment and on the edge of my seat the next.\n\r\nThe subtle development of these Ohma and Kozou is truly something special. It's not often that you see such well-crafted characters in an anime, and the way their stories intertwine is truly a testament to the writing of the series.\n\r\nOverall: 7.26/10.\n"
