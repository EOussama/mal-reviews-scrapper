    "content": "\n                This was definitely the most \u201cmeh\u201d One Piece movie in a while.\n\r\nAs much as it hurts me to say, I refrained from reviewing the movie for as long as I've been trying to justify exciting it more than it deserved, because, well, it's One Piece. Much like most One Piece fans, I was hyped to the max for this movie, as most of us call it, \u201cShanks's move\u201d. It was something it felt like 2 decades coming, but never too late, we finally get to know more about this fan-favorite character, until we didn't... Well, kinda.\n\r\nNo spoilers in check, the info we deluded ourselves wewere gonna get was nowhere in sight, II don't get why they decided to include it in the booklet given for free for people who watched the movie in Japan, the movie had a lot of screentime to cram the info in, heck, the Manga could have taken a couple of chapters to the whole thing. We took the hit on this one.\n\r\nReality has it, this was a mediocre One Piece movie with a few hype moments, and a fantastic musical fiasco that did not slow down on creativity. The key here is to know what to expect, II have never heard about Ado before this movie, and I assure you it will not be the case after it, I mean, for someone with the same name as Oda sensei, only in reverse (Oda => Ado), destiny did quite a play on us. I loved every single song featured in the movie, and the visual choreography was no idle either, really, a masterful presentation for what felt like a lifetime music festival that just happened to be taking place in the world of One Piece.\n\r\nThe animation felt right at home, nothing too crazy, thanks to Toei's amazing work lately on the anime, the movie mentions the same Wano arc with all the swirly washed-up strokes, and of course, some average CGI blending that could have been omitted in my opinion.\n\r\nThe plot itself was nothing spectacular, again, much like Stampede, the whole setup felt like a fan service showcase that revolves around the Red-Haired Pirates.\n\r\nOverall: 8.32\n"
