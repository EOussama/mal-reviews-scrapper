    "content": "\n                The biggest ordeal sequels have to deal with, not just in Anime, but in general media, is that a sequel is required to be a perfect improvement over its predecessor. The second season of Son of Ogre takes the baton in turn with ferocity and delivers a jaw-breaking continuation that is nothing short of the classic Baki experience that we all know and love.\n\r\nAgain, in the most prolific Baki fashion, Itagaki delivers yet another sanity question plot development that tangles together a pre-historic plot point, the awaited father-son duel, and a random Retsu boxing side quest. And it was nothing else but absolute cinema.\n\r\nWe gotthe action that was hyped up for so long delivered, and that\u2019s a very hard promise to fulfill, especially in such a popular franchise as Baki. And it was consistent enough that the secondary plot points did not feel bland in comparison, it was a progressive stage play that didn\u2019t need to beg for your attention, because it was already living rent-free in your mind the night before.\n\r\noverall: 8.4/10.\n"
