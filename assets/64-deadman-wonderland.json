This one of those shows that meets a lot of hate and criticism, some say it sucks, some call it a masterpiece, others hide behind the fact that the manga was better. But no matter how good or bad the source material is, theadaptation is an entirely different work that can have a lot of issues on its own, slow-pacing, event-skipping, filler and more.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nOn one of those lovely quite days, a major incident took place in Tokyo, a humongous explosion that ended up erasing great landscapes in an out-of-this-world manner. 10 years later, A private prison had already rested on the exact same location the explosion originated from, under the name of Wonderland that uses its prisoners as a source of entertainment for other people putting them in death battles, challenges, events. And keeping a spare of interesting residents are test subjects.\r\nA naive middle school student, Ganta, gets framed for killing his entire classmates by some of the prison's officials and as consequence, he's sent to Wonderland to serve his sentence. Filled with hatred and Anger towards the Red Man that massacred his friends, he strives to get his revenge. If you're still wondering about the \u201cDeadman\u201d part in the title, that's a term used to refer to people that have a special power called \u201cThe Branch of Sin\u201d that allows the users to control their blood in a manner that enables them to fight, we're talking about bloody swords, tentacles, bullets...etc. Cool huh? Well, the idea and everything is there, but the execution was not what you'd call a great job. In a lot of other shows, slow pacing kills off a lot of the hype and story progression, but in this one, there was a pacing very fast that the story itself couldn't keep up in a steady way, and thus rendered most of the event blurry and dull. The action starts up very early on, but I'm really not the type of guy that gets impressed by flashy colors and butterflies, in this case, gore and violence. Yes, I do enjoy my gory anime, but only if it was done right and in concise doses, and I'll spare Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate from this because those had their reasons. As I mentioned before, this is like that edgy early teen boy that thinks he is cool and badass just because he can spit off slurs and throw in partial nudity and excessive gore every 3 minutes, no, that's not the way to do it. A lot of very important plot points got skipped and never were explained, and most of the flashback characters were never officially introduced or given a proper reason on how they disappeared.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nIf anything, they did not slack off animating blood, and thankfully they didn't, seeing how it plays a major role than just acting like a dumb liquid that needs every excuse to splash around (Why am I getting worked up over blood? lol). Something I like here was the character designs, I have to give some extra points just for that, no crazy hairstyles, no inhuman anatomy or anything from that caliber, but still, it had its own cartoonish taste, and fed perfectly their sadistic smiles with life and horror. And I'm dead serious, those were some really terrifying evil smiles that could alone immobilize you. The way the fights where animated made up for the horrible story progression in my eyes. I never knew I was into good liquid animation until I saw how fluid their blood flowed (literally). I'm queuing up some GIF of blood projectiles at the moment of writing this review just for how satisfying they felt when they hit the target.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nLet's talking about the opening and ending theme songs and get them out of the way. The opening is unforgettable, and seeing how it has English lyrics all the way till the end makes it a bit easy on the memory, sounding as savage as the show wants to pretend to be like, and as the first lyric says \u201cSlit the throat of reason and reality\u201d, that alone prepares you for what there is in store of madness to come.\r\nUnlike the opening, the ending theme song was very light on the heart, both on the audio and the visuals, complimented by the characters in their past lives when everything was still okay. I can't say much about the soundtrack as I am all focusing on the blood animations, I could have sworn I canceled all other senses just to power up my sight and get the most out of those fluid animations. The voice acting was decent, talking about the SUB version here, I didn't enjoy the main character's high pitched voice that much, to be honest.\n\r\n- Character (6.5/10):\r\nI thought for the longest time that Yuki from Mirai Nikki is holding the title of the most annoying main character, but I guess that Ganta might steal that away from him, the guy literally is made to annoy the freaks out of you. Making immature wrong decisions all of the time, and never learns from his mistakes, acts always like he's the one in the right path and keeps mumbling some talk-no-jutsu black magic while being the most hypocrite figure on the show. And the list keeps on going filled with forgettable characters except for one cool guy called Crow, he sure got his ssslices (yes, that's how it's spelled) on point.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI would be frank here, I had to pause the series midway for some in real life reasons, and I haven't resumed the watch until a month later, and to make it even harsh on the show, the first 6 episodes weren't all that exciting for me that I was going to give up on the series and give it a 5 or lower, but I feel like the last half had some improvements over the first one. It really took its time to introduced major characters, 4 episodes left to the end and tons of questions were still unanswered.\n\r\n- Overall (7.1/10):\r\nNot my proudest recommendation. Before watching it for myself, the title of the show always gave me shivers of badassery and excitement to see the actual anime, but it didn't turn up the way I imagined it to be, in fact, it wasn't even close. However, that doesn't make it entirely a bad show, I enjoyed what there was for me to enjoy. Do I want a sequel? absolutely, and as I've said, the general idea of the plot sounds very cool, and I'd like to see a better remake or a deserving sequel that makes up for this, a lot say the Manga is better, and that brings some hope.\n"
