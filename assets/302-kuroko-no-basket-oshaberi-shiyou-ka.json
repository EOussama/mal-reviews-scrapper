Like seriously, seeing everything the series has to offer feels like rewatching the whole three seasonsthree times if not four.\n\r\nThey always try to laugh it off as a Fan Disc where they can do whatever they want, often breaking the fourth wall and laughing like they just told the greatest joke ever, but at the third freaking Fan Disc, it had already become stale and repetitive enough for me not to care, even after over a 5 months break from last seeing anything Kuroku no Basket related.\n"
