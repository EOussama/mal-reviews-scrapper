Guess what I did?\n\r\nYeah, you\u2019re already here reading the review, so I\u2019ll spare you the suspense.\n\r\nI signed up for a cool Kaiju-fighting action drama but what I got instead was a wholesome slice of life-y comedy with cool Kaiju-fighting action and a bit of drama. I think I must have won the seasonal lottery. And that\u2019s quite rare.\n\r\nNow, for my personal hook, the opening still slapped and still does even after finishing the show. Thevisuals are trippy, seeming of mystery, and the song elevates that to boot. And no, it didn\u2019t stop there because I\u2019m at an even greater shock that the ending, mainly the used song far exceeds that of the opening, and I\u2019m forever appreciative of a banger ending song.\n\r\nComing from a software development background, hearing the name Kafka did bring out a chuckle more than a few times, however, it does not take away anything from the main character. The supporting cast is interesting enough. Actually, above average to say the truth, it seems like they are laying foundations early on to some really good future developments that I hope do not go unnoticed.\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it really is an action story which lots of cool moments and hype fights, I would say it definitely sets itself apart from all of the other seasonal \u201cfiller\u201d shows, and is absolutely a great watch.\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\n"
