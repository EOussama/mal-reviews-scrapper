    "content": "\n                This was not good, it could have been arguably better, but chances were missed ever since they abused the classic \u201ckill them all\u201d bait, it would have been fine using it one time, but not, it seems like every movie had several moments of this, but this last one seems to have been composed of mainly just that.\r\nA plot that lives off its hacky armor can never improve the mediocracy it's composed of, I don't know what I was expecting, but the clich\u00e9 good guys can even escape death has gone out of fashion, even for a show from the early 2010s.\n\r\nI would, of course,give credit wherever it's due, and the animation folks have outdone most of their collective work regarding the whole series, there were some bugging flaws here and there, but this was the best entry to feature CGI that blends with the 2D environment the best.\r\nI feel like I just have to pick on the lack of the majestic ending song that made the previous movies great while at that too. I don't think I'll have to watch this series ever again, or at least, not in the foreseeable 3 years or so.\n"
