    "content": "\n                I guess every popular show has got to have filler content included in the Blu-ray / DVD releases. The Sword Art Offline special shorts are just that to SAO in general, from this one it picks up the trend of the simulcast Chibi commentary trying to hide the fact that it's just another cheap trick to force you into watching a recap.\n\r\nIt goes through the entirety of Aincrad and ALfheim arcs, I liked the trivia section. The jokes were lazy and trying too hard at times, thank God for the short length of the episodes (11 minutes) or else it would have been a nightmareto good through.\n\r\nThe art style is very barebones, a mix between Chibi a,d picture drama, it doesn't try too hard and pulls off what it wants just decently.\n"
