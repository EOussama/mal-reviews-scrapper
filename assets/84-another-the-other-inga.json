It dives in something we didn't see much of in the parent series and ends in a majestic seamless way that translates to the first episode in a genius way.\r\nMei, before she was the lonely creepy student we've come to know got to spend some time with her twin sister where we got to see more on how Mei feels about it for what dispute led to it.\r\nNow, it's been a long time since I last watched the parent series, overtwo years to be more specific, and I don't know if it always looked like this, but, the art and animation are truly gorgeous, Aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I'm talking like I was seriously surprised by the quality of that eye candy.\r\nThe same old opening and ending theme songs were used which are just so nostalgic and would have been a crime if they weren't included, to be frank. I think I might have enjoyed this more than I gave it credit for, actually, I've enjoyed this more so than I did with the original series and I'm just so lost in why I didn't watch it earlier.\n"
