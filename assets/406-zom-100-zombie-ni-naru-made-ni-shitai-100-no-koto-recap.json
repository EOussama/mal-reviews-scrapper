    "content": "\n                This is a special episode that covers the first seven episodes of the anime.\n\r\nIt summarizes the events of those first bit sized arcs, which is very useful for the viewers who are returning to the show after the hiatus that was issued due to production scheduling problems. It was a decent refresher on what has entailed especially that it has been a while in the time. While of course, being a recap, it\u2019s natural that a lot will be cut off to save up on time, but really, nothing that major has happened at this point of the show that it was more or lessthe right amount of recap to maybe gain a fraction of interest.\n"
