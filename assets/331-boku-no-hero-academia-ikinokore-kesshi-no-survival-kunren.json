    "content": "\n                The thing with Boku no Hero Academia is that the entry-level is so low, virtually anyone can enjoy an episode or two without even being an avoid Anime watcher. I feel like these special episodes are the best way possible to introduce someone to a show, they don't need a full understanding of the encompassed plotlines diverting left and right to understand whatever is happening on the screen, a two-episode show about heroes in training going about their own day, very simple and applicable.\n\r\nJust like the show, these two episodes could have been naked into any season without it even feeling filler-ish, normal dialogue, allmain characters were involved, pretty decent animation, and most of all, fan service (the good one that involves fan-favorite characters having their moments to shine).\n\r\nI've been away from this series for a long time now but that did not stop me from enjoying every minute of these two episodes, despite the low stakes, it kept me on my toes, fully engaged and attentive.\n"
