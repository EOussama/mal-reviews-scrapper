What initiated the first thought of producing such a comeback? Was it an industry-leading figure at the time? Did it remarkably impact the industry that it deserved such a revival? Or did a rich anonymous weeb decide to suddenly fund the recut? Whatever the reason, curiosity was eating my thoughts like raging maggots. I need answeres, and watching the original TV show was the way togo about it. But wait, there is an introductory pilot episode that I had to take care of, enter \u201cDororo Pilot\u201d.\n\r\nFrom what I had gathered, the series serves as a deliberate recap for what to come next in the main series. One interesting observation was how it featured colors!! Yeah, very interesting from a super old animation, and I don't have the historical context to link its serialization period with the request technology that outputs such a colored sequence.\r\nThe art style emphasizes the show's old age like wrinkles on a world war survivor's face. Aside from the average, outdated visuals, the vocals, specifically, the OST was just spot on, putting modern-day adaptations to shame. It was riding along the atmosphere of the show, matching the rhythm of the story more than the narrative itself, really putting you into the spirit of watching more.\n"
