    "content": "\n\r\nAs hard as it might be to find, or even notice, many viewers get to watching this without even batting an eye, thinking it was an episode from the main show. \r\n\u201cBlack Cat: Tooza karu neko\u201d or \u201cBlack Cat: The Distant Cat\u201d, and sometimes called Black Cat episode 14.5. Remember that the anime has 23 official episodes, not 24, so in case you're watching your fair share of 24 episodes of \u201cBlack Cat\u201d, you will have to note that the 15th episode would be this one.\n\r\nThe change in storytelling they had in this episode, linking parallel events as they progress surprisingly worked really good here.You can tell that the purpose was to justify a number of plot points a clear out many mysterious relationships between several characters, which the spotlights being on Train and Sephiria giving us glimpse of how they both met, and what kind of person each one of them sees the other.\n\r\nIn the context of the story, it didn't do any great deeds really, but it was nice seeing more of Train's past, how he completed his first mission and how he transformed to the ice cold killer we all have come to know. You could have already watched this without even realizing as I said before, but in case you haven't, it wouldn't hurt to see it.\n"
