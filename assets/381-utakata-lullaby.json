I love it.\n\r\nI don't necessarily remember this song from the movie, however, this hard slaps in every way imaginable. The music video wasn't anything worthy of praise, but not bad either, however, the song, the beat, the flow, I'm not a music person but these select of bops were IT.\n\r\nI can see myself getting obsessed with this son in 2 or 3 more listens. The rapping part was hype and the only reason I might not have remembered it is due to it being played at a fast-paced part that had me skipa heartbeat and not realize what was playing.\n"
