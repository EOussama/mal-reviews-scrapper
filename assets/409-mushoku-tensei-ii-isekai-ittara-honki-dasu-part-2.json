    "content": "\n                Mushoku Tensei has proven itself multiple times over at this point, that, making a review for one of its later arcs is kind of pointless unless you\u2019re comparing it to its prequels.\n\r\nOne thing I really like to describe it that it\u2019s the only Isekai where the past life matters. Looking at how most shows can\u2019t even make their main plot interesting, Mushoku breaks that bound, everything is interesting because simply, everything is encompassed by the main plot. It is simply a series.\n\r\nThe second part of season two takes off straight where the previous one left off, with a seamless transition to what concluded, and alsoincludes the Labyrinth arc.\n\r\nIt\u2019s funny how a show so heavy on magic has magic that surrounds it of its own, it feels so slow-paced and slice of life-y at a glance, but once you zoom out the slightest you feel everything passing by, almost at lightning speed. It\u2019s a story that does not wait for your attention but also gives time to its characters. It's kind of like real life. It\u2019s believable.\n\r\nYet again, the entire cast, not only Rudy goes through immense development, and not just physically. We see heartfelt sorrow, constant struggles, and visible pain all throughout, all accompanied by rational decisions and believable conclusions that genuinely enhance the slow pace.\n\r\nPart one might not have been w<hat a lot of people wanted from season two, but this part definitely makes up for it.\n\r\nOverall: 9.14/10.\n"
