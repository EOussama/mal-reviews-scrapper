It's the case of FLCL and the Pillows all over again, the music stucks on from the first second and goes on just as strong and tingly with a dark direction, it sounds like a screaming confused teenager that's stuck between depression and addiction.\r\nAlongside the music, an animated short was being displayed to accompany the words spoken into the visual language, we get to follow what seems like a lonely girl in her room, probably her only shelter, hiding from the outside world,and as the music nears the final verses, she finally finds the courage to pull off her remaining strength and hit the road to sort out whatever was in her mind.\n"
