While they were moving in into a new town, Chihiro and her family decide to take a wrong turn out of curiosity, and that turn just happened to lead to the realm of spirits in which our story calls home.\r\nChihiro is exposed to a harsh reality she never knew, and her parents' freedom is at her mercy. As the time goes by, she makes friends and foes while trying to earn her quest for salvation.\r\nThat was all about the main focus of the plot, pretty basic and child-friendly. But under this thick skin of basic story lays layers of related highlights on all sorts of different relatable feelings we humans are cursed by, greed, jealousy, and bad intentions, as the protagonist forms new relationships, it becomes apparent which are the souls that are after fortune, and those of loyal love and kindness.\n\r\n- Art (10.0/10):\r\nAbsolutely stunning, I really hesitate most of the time on rating this part of the shows I get to review because of how much tricky it can be. Good animation doesn't resolve on high resolution, or high frames per seconds, even a still image can make a difference, and this is what Spirited Away does best. I've watched other Ghibli films which I still think are superior in terms of story and characters but talking about the art style and the animation, this blows away pretty much every single one of them. I still find it odd how can an animation from almost two decades ago be this good, I mean, really good, the painted backgrounds, and sharp edges on the fast-paced animations are just so satisfying to look at, I could get some high cinemagraphs on almost every frame I pause the video at. The 3D and anatomy proportions never feel unnatural and some of the scenes are just breathtaking that they end up distracting you from following the story at times, which is a good thing here, because it's used right, like when every field of flowers is on display, you can almost feel the wind blowing through your skin.\r\nAnother aspect of the animation was the bright use of alive colors, everything is colorful and attractive, the food, the clothes, skies, even mud feels nice to stare at. This is, by the very definition if great animation, a perfect work of art.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nNot exactly the most memorable aspect of this movie, I don't think I even noticed there being any soundtracks playing mostly because I was so invested and paying full attention to what's going on the screen due to the gorgeous animation, for the most part, there were some really nostalgic Disney like sound effects kicking every now and then, and the voice acting was decent to kind of good on many occasions. Something about the protagonist just didn't catch the confusion of a 10 years old girl, some other voice acting moments felt also too forced and out of nature.\n\r\n- Character (7.2/10):\r\nDespite the very, very huge cast spanning this two hours long animation, none of them made me want more screen time of them, not that they were annoying or anything, in fact, I don't believe I got annoyed by anybody, and still, not a single one managed to have me on their side, I, of course, would still be rooting for the protagonist, but not care way too much in case something bad happened. Those all fall under the personalities and treats of the characters, another aspect concerning them, which I really am into is the character design, I have a mix between the classic Disney and anime treats, I like the way they depicted the old vicious lady and all other spirits.\r\nLastly, there was the character development, through the movie, Chihiro managed to fix her flaws, learned to stop being a brat that complains about everything, to a more mature and understanding behaving little girl.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nThis was a decent experience, the movie managed to pick my interest on many occasions, but then getting uninterested minutes later, the pace was a bit too slow,  but the story progressed fine as I think, definitely the most family friendly Ghibli film I've seen so far, will I see it again, absolutely, next time with some friends.\n\r\n- Overall (8.0/10):\r\nSpirited Away is a wholesome experience suited for all people from toddlers to elders, it sets a nice tone for family and friendship and overcoming hardship, it isn't the highest grossing film in Japan for nothing, whether you have a taste in Ghibli films or not, heck even if you don't watch Anime movies at all, this could be your gateway through for all we know, fun watch for all, have fun.\n"
