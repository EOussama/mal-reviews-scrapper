    "content": "\n                Steins;Gate OVA have always been on the upper side with the rest of the top quality OVAs, however, \u201cSteins;Gate 0: Kesshou Takei no Valentine - Bittersweet Intermedio\u201d betrayed that statement, and what a well-fitting title to a Steins;Gate related piece of work.\r\nIt would have been a bit more fitting to waiting a little longer until Valentine's day comes over and then release this OVA, as it tackles just that, the cast is gathered (the females and Ruka at least) to bake some chocolate for Valentine's day as they go along with teasing each other of who they will present their chocolates to. And with sometwists and with the help of Suzuha's far fetched imagination, they do make for amazing comedic opportunities that unfortunately are not well driven from there.\r\nThis OVA also gives us a snip of Mayuri that I personally never asked for, that is, erotic Mayuri, how could they taint such a pure soul?\r\nThe entire episode is one average wholesome and fun slice of life that only gives a nip of interesting twist at the end with Karagi and her disappearance.\n"
