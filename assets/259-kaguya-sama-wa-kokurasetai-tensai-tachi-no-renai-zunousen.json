Yes, the one everybody was obsessed about just a year ago where all the talk and shit was centered around, well; It's back again.\u201d - Nobody heard that.\n\r\nWhen it first came out, Kaguya-sama was all the fuss and trendy buzz, even after it finished, for a few months, the praise never stopped. Fast forward a year later a second season was due to release, something very unusual in the industry for a quality popular show to receive a sequel in such a relatively short time, I mean, nothing wrong was going to happen, it should work out just like it did withAttack on Titan after it's initial 4 years hiatus, the fans were there when it stopped and came back when it returned. Unfortunately, Kaguya-sama had it the opposite way.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nThe reason why the second season didn't have as much of a following as the first one will probably be a mystery, maybe people thought it ended, and word of a sequel never broke any louder, but the show over here felt like it never stopped, episode one is just a masked episode 13 that follows the same vibes and build-ups of the first season, making it for the perfect enter-season binge-watch that you can hope for. The quality did not suffer one drop, staying true to what made it great in the first place.\r\nMuch like the first season, the episode^s is packed with content that makes it seem impossible to fit and direct in the same episode, but they somehow do it and never overdose you with the show's greatness, every episode, or should I say, every third of an episode feels like a self-contained plot that's self-aware of its junky placement that never ceases to make sense chronologically, most of the mini-arcs are an episode or less long with a couple of them spanning 2 episodes at most.\r\nLast season may have been overly focused on the two main pair but this one felt like it had us more at home with the rest of the supporting cast and even introducing new faces and expanding on other. This is definitely a Kaguya-sama 2, both chronologically in terms of narrative and quality.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nLet's get it out of the way, there was nothing like the Chika dance in this season, but that one was more about the quirkiness of it than the visuals.\r\nKaguya-sama feels safe in the visual department, one reason being, the studio behind it, A-1 Pictures is more than capable of holding on their standards, and the second reason being, the genre, and flow of the narrative distances itself from being too dependant of the animation to carry everything else, however, the art style is a very experimentally unstable factor that really puts it over many other shows,l and don't get me started on the Sh\u014djo episode.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nNarrator-kun strikes back with an amazing record drop, after the opening of the first season, you'd think nothing will be as classy, but then they hit you with the Daddy Daddy Do magic. It lives up to the first opening, being so damn catchy and easy to Kareoke without having to risk summoning a legion of demons, although, it's debatable still.\r\nThe ending theme song is just as good, creating a good contrast from the comedy heavy, sometimes emotional episodes.\r\nThe voice acting is just as over the top as ever, I can't believe how even after a year, the voices of the characters were still engraved in my head that hearing them again felt like something I do on the daily basis.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nShows like Kaguya-sama (which are very few) really transcend the \u201ccharacter-development\u201d trope. Really, cherry-pick a random character from the show, they are not limited and or restricted to a linear development plan that forces them to act upon in order for the plot to progress forward, everyone is separated from the plot, very flexible and can adapt any situation that they find themselves into because the magic of this show is about the chemistry between them that's born from the most awkward set of inconveniences.\r\nLet's all agree, Ishigami was always best girl even with only season one's content, however, after seeing a couple of episodes he moved all the way on top of the ladder, which an amazing backstory that explains everything about him to the faintest of details.\r\nThe introduction of the new characters was a great addition that nobody knew they wanted this bad as the student council was always lively and cheerful, to begin with, but now, amp up that a few folds.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nEvery episode had bowls worth of tears from the excessive, sometimes unhealthy laughter, the season pushed some boundaries and even reminds you why the first season was so good. Something I never expected the show to manage is to set a higher ceiling even to itself.\r\nEvery episode felt like the same but had an entirely different set to go through, bringing in the new every minute, an amazing rom-com to its very roots.\n\r\n- Overall (9/10):\r\nHonestly, it couldn't get any better, but hey, just as it outdid itself, maybe a third season (please let it happen) might also do just that.\r\nKaguya-sama used to fill me with a love-hate feeling during the first season, maybe it had so\u00f9mething to do with its popularity, but when you ignore all of those stupid half-baked excuses you can finally see what the show has to offer. Season two was an extension of the land of the familiar, it delivered on all of the fantasies that we had about a sequel to the first season and even exceeded it, something sequels are infamous for not doing.\n"
