    "content": "\n                Shaman King in 2024 is a very weird case, On one hand, the deep nostalgia of the OG really gets to you, those were undoubtedly unforgotten times, but then again, upon viewing the 2021 remake, lots of points were lost, what a horrendous adaptation that was for the most part, some very good highs yes, but also, some of the blended adaptations you could ask for, the ones where it would have been better off not existing. Cut a few years forward, we get a Boruto-esque epilogue series that tries to be something more than overstays its welcome, enter, Shaman King: Flowers.\n\r\nWho asked for this?Seriously; We have seen so many times how the Boruto trend does not work well for the parent series, especially for stories like Shaman King where the previous show perfectly summed everything up into a well close-ended finale that did not need to branch into anything else.\n\r\nLet's start with the characters, Hana, as a protagonist really differs from Yoh, while the former was calm and chill, this new mf can't take a break, he's angry all the time, very emotional, way too hot-headed, he's more like Ren than Yoh from a certain perspective, not to mention, the old cast, now being grown up, all seem very generic adults not contributing anything massive to the plot, almost as if the whole Shaman thing was child's play and their adult selves got no time to play and mess around like before, the new cast is even blander, aside from they whacky designs that stick out, the offer nothing impactful, not even a decent flashback.\n\r\nI'll admit though, although from the start to the middle of the season, nothing felt like happening, it was as if everything was stuck in a time loop where the plot did not move forward, the same villain-of-the-week-esque vibe over and over again until some answers were given, and the scale of the story became clearer, and with the introduction of some new characters, it felt way more interesting of a plot, I'm not gonna lie, I wished for this trainwreck to end all the way up until the last few episodes were I wished there was a sequel already ready to be binged.\n\r\nYet again, animation and voice acting, both were so generic, felt so cheap, decent enough to keep looking but nothing to gloat about.\r\nThe OP and ED were fine I guess, but man, anything else can save this adaptation, unless the plot continues on the track of the last arc.\n\r\nOverall: 6.78/10.\n"
