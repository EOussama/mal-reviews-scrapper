The gags are there, they have a strong drive and present on the plot's progression, but there is also a character than came to stay, \u201ccool\u201d, \u201ccooler\u201d, \u201ccoolest\u201d, as the narrator says, let me add to that, \u201ccooliest\u201d. If that word isn't on the dictionary then Sakamoto has it already reserved, and this show says why that is.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nIf you're coming at the show as a challenge to your connoisseurtaste in storytelling, don't expect anything else, as the norm has it, gags are just there as comic relief that fills up boring padding in the story and lights up the atmosphere if needed, but here it's a stable of the plot, something that alters it at a moment's notice all for the sake of a coherent progression.\r\nThe pacing of the show varies from mini-arc to another, each episode features at least two different skits show why Sakamoto is a cool as he is, solidifying his personality and immortalizing it in your head, but that could also be due to that popular \u201ctheory\u201d that I'm not a big subscriber of but it does make sense by the end of the show.\n\r\nThis is a comedy standup that draws you in with how funny and light-hearted it is while discussing some real-world problems that everyone can relate to. Loneliness, Being bullied, Unaquired love, all are gently tackled by Sakamoto in the coolest way until the show ends up on a bittersweet note that both contradicts and emphasizes the wholesomeness that floating around the show.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThis one was weird. A close mix of 90's Shojo and modern trash Shounen, the characters change styles according to the circumstance which is a great plus. The backgrounds are nothing special given the setting of the story, so no nitpick from that part. A proper way to put it, good enough to keep you watching.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nWhen it came to voice acting, it wasn't the strongest point of the Anime. Aside from Sakamoto who's voice was luxury to get to hear, the rest of the cast was decent, no bad performance or anything, just decent on the grander scale of things. The openings and endings, however, were bangers and the OST is so memorable and classy it fits perfectly.\n\r\n- Characters (9/10):\r\nThis is probably the best thing about this show. Gag series should really focus more on its characters, they are the means the show delivers its jokes, they are the vessel that carries the dialog, and Sakamoto desu ga nails that aspect perfectly. Sakamoto is a genuinely likable character starting from the very first second he's introduced at. He's calm, daring, and cool, he affects the story on a great scale just like what a protagonist following the book should. The supporting cast is amazing, both the friend and the foe, they fulfill their roles in the most suitable way making you both love and hate them according to the situation. I can't find a single character to hate for the sake of being a badly written character, not even Fukase. congratulations on your graduation by the way.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nWhat a sit-through. I'm glad I haven't bloated through this series in a single sitting, I feel like an idol such as Sakamoto is the kind of character you need to see and hear from on a daily basis with proper breaks in between, the relationship you end up having with this fictional character is only clearly visible when you realize you're at the last 3 minutes of the series. God, I'm going to miss this show.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nI came in for \u201cyour perfect merry-sue of your highschool\u201d gag and came out as a follower of the Sakamoto cult, this show works wonders. Some individual skits have the potential to branch off in, to their own separate series, that's how good some of the skits were. It gets extremely wholesome and funny sometimes but some other times you are hit with the hardest ball of feels that you never see coming, it's how unpredictable it is what makes most of this show. There are so many comedy Anime out there, but there is only one and only Sakamoto.\n"
