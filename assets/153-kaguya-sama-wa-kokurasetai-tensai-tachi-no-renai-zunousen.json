I would genuinely start off every episode with very low expectations almost looking down on the series that I would end up looking up just like Boa Hancock, however, a certain charm that comes with this show manages to convert my disappointment grin to a genuinely happy face at the end of every episode, and it wasn't toolong before I just gave up and approved the show to be that of a high quality, a show that stands up high among many, which is rarely the case in my experience.\r\nThe Rom-Com genre is always present every season but only rarely comes a show that excels at adapting the source material and preserving the identity of plot whilst nailing what makes an Anime successful and accessible. \u201cKaguya-sama love is war\u201d doesn't just nail that, it makes you begging for more shows on the same quality and sets off a high roof for other shows to follow, it was one big fest of historically insane laughter, a rollercoaster that smasher your tiny pathetic heart into pieces as it waters your eyes as if it was a plant, all in the same episode when you least expect it. It has deffintelety found its identity this season and gained a lot of following from both its OG fans and a lot of newer ones, and what enabled most of that was its unique concept of romance that was probably its biggest selling point.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nWhat can be described as a select of episodic consequences of actions which also have a big relational feel to them as several plot point can bring up past happenings, a race between two brilliant students that everybody looks up to on who will confess first, and no, it's not a delicate game of chess either, both of them fabricate all sorts of strategies to lead the other one into submission, while every day has its victor, sometimes it just doesn't work for either.\r\nI'm sure we've all seen our fair share of rom-com shows to conclude that what this show, in particular, is one of a class, never have I seen a series with the same take, turning a desirable feeling (love) into an intense challenge that can create a lot of opportunities for comedy in the meantime.\r\nThe show feeds heavily on pop culture references, intense fights between two brains and strategies that can overthrow a country. It also tackles small elements of friendship and family, two themes that work together and are very relatable to most of us.\r\nIt is safe to excuse the fast pace of the storytelling as all episodes will end up focusing on up to three mini-stories all self-contained while still relating to the main goal of the plot which is a point because comedy shows can get a bit too daunting and repetitive if they took a slower route.\r\nIt seems that even a show that has comedy of all things as a priority, the plot kept hinting at a lot of deeper concepts you never saw coming, most of them are from backstories of the main cast, the like of which deserve a standalone series.\n\r\nArt (8.8/10):\r\nWe never ask for the latest animation practices or the most fluid frame technology usage when it comes to shows that are not that concerned about their visual quality, but that was exactly what we got nevertheless, and you know what? That's a welcomed surprise.\r\nThe character design of all things looks very generic and slice-of-life-ish but it was the animation, the sudden dramatic background changes and the unfamiliar camera positioning that highlighted a lot of the motion than was needed.\r\nSome of the minor scenes ended up looking very clean and fluid it got a lot of people's attention just for that, a two-minute short dance which very slick movement's that I'm sure was traced on top of a real performer which only helped its fluidity and consistency.\r\nThe color palette remained all bright and appealing to the eye, a lot of emphasis on primary colors that only get darker as the tone of the show shifts to something more serious.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe overall performance was, great, just what's needed to not have you bash on the vocal quality of the show. As dramatic as some portions were, the voice acting felt just natural to deliver the same emotions spoken from the characters that it seems very believable and with no room for cringe-worthy performances.\r\nBoth the opening and the ending were so good they called up along the more popular shows of the season securing their own place in those popular Anime song quizzes with ease.\r\nThe soundtrack was suiting to the overall tone of the show, blending so much that it's not noticeable anymore, but it's there to highlight the other vocal element like voice acting and dramatic win blowing sound effects.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nIn most similar entries of the same genre, the characters seem pretty interchangeable and not all that \u201cof a depth\u201d, there is going to be a vast selection of waifus and husbandos of course, a lot of figures will be favorites that get talked about all the time but that doesn't mean they are that well-written carrier of the plot precisely.\r\nAside from Kaguya, which has her name in the title along with other well distinguishable facial features like her red eyes that are viewed as a special trademark in the run of the show, every other character is so plain looking that they end up like shallow mannequins looking common side character trope, not going to lie, Shirogane, a crucial figure to the story as a protagonist can easily be lost between a crown of background characters which is not specifically the point from a show of this genre.\r\nAnother horribly written abomination is Chika, she's got a huge fan following behind her from performing a certain dance at the early stages of the show and to be honest, a doll in a puppet show looks way more interesting than her empty childish head and twisted nature of screwing up a handful of great moment which I guess had a hand in creating good humor, but compared to the other cast, she was just an abused punching bag of a comic relief that we really didn't need in a show that especially focuses on comedy as one of the main factors of its storytelling.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI think I've stressed what I really thought and ended up thinking about the series, what started as an old close minded fella with a closed mentality that bashed every aspect of the show ended up cheering for a second adaptation. I'd always have a respectable amount of a good time on every episode no matter how straight my face was at the moment I hit play on the episodes, the humor was hilarious, the sad moments were very down and gloomy and with a lot of sense behind them.\r\nA generous amount of humor comes from the narrator himself that breaks down the fourth wall on multiple occasion making the viewer even closer to the scenery portrayed.\n\r\nOverall (8.26/10):\r\nThis is one definitive recommendation from me, and I'm sure a lot of people do agree with me here. Without a doubt, it has some minor problems that can easily be ignored without sacrificing what makes the show unique and worthy of your time.\n"
