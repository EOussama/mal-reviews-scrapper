Or at least, that's what one of the two episodes was, a dilemma where the main cast deals with Raygo's assistant, revealing more about her past and some hints that link up a few plot points that have been left off of themain storyline. I was not a big fan of the finale, I\r\n  hated Ryuko's stupid out-of-nowhere power up. As a constraint, the animation was gorgeous, however, as I was so unfortunate as o watch the dub version, and don't get me wrong, I love my dubbed Anime, but this was just so bad I couldn't enjoy most of it.\r\nAs for the second episode, it was a recap around 9 minutes of length, I only got to find it in Spanish, and my Spanish is nowhere near getting comfortable to watch Anime in. But it was visually enjoyable, to say the least.\n"
