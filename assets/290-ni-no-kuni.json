This entire movie's script.\r\nNi no Kuni is one of those shows that I happened to find on a whim, just looking for something to watch on a lazy Netflix day. I had no attachment to the game franchise nor have I even heard of anything related to it before then, but the description seemed like any trash Isekai that I can shut my brain off and still enjoy, but it turned out that even trash has tiers and unfortunately, Ni no Kuno fails to stand out even among the lowest of the low.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nI wish I canskip this portion entirely, we all know, it's not Ni no Kuni's fault, but the entire Isekai shitfest is practically the same, only with different names and powers.\r\nThis story starts like every other, two friends travel between two worlds in order to keep their other friend alive, simple enough, but the complications really add a bit of sugar to this dull piece of work.\r\nThe plot, however, feels a little more quirky and interesting when the threads are laid out, how the two main characters are related, and how their actions in either world affect the other. But it still was not enough to save it from its clich\u00e9 infested progression that had me fall asleep mid of the movie.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI don't know whether I should be proud of the recent seasonal shows or disappointed in this movie, cause I'm trying so hard to note a moment that showed the slightest marvel animation but I can not. It was averagely animated, easily looks like any typical modern show which by the way is great in their own way, but for a movie? That was very underwhelming. The character designs look nothing interesting, very generic looking, and can be swapped by any background filler character without anyone noticing, not even themselves. Yuu, however, looks like your classic Ghibli prince and that's it. There was also a use of horrible CGI at times, but not too much that it completely ruined the experience.\n\r\nSound (7/10):\r\nNothing to complain about here, but also nothing to admire. Following the same steps of the story, it was not memorable in the least, the voice acting I thought was decent, the musical scores were fine but too special that sticks to memory.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nAgain, walking out reeking of disappointment, the story starts out very solid for an Isekai looking at the characters and their motives, however, shortly after everyone just stops trying. Yuu is a very boring Mary-Sue type of character that feels like he's reciting a 1000 pages inspirational quotes repository, and Haru is a jealous end that tries to create drama and lengthen the story for the sake of it being long enough to be featured as a movie. Character development is very minimal, almost non-existent, and includes only Haru, as for everyone else, I've seen more interesting wooden planks in my backyards.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nI can't describe this being anything more than average, so much so that I'm starting my own average Isekai metric system in which Ni no Kuni is the core of the measure. The premise is very interesting and holds a lot of potentials that it left me kinda lost in thought thinking of how the movie could have been if they did not screw everything up.\n\r\nOverall (6.9):\r\nNo matter how average this movie was, and no matter how little I consider rewatching it any time soon or ever, I would probably jump back on it with a group of friends for how easy and simple to get into it and still grasp everything happening despite talking over every scene and fool around instead of focusing all of your attention on it. Other than that, if you're coming from the game franchise, that could be an entire another discussion that I'm not able to project.\n"
