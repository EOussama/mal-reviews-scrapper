    "content": "\n                Finally, after a grueling wait, it finished airing. For the record, this OVA was released along with a lengthy schedule and also in a weird drip-feeding manner.\r\nthe second episode was the first one to air, and then a pause that spanned almost 4 months was issued until the second episode finally aired. That's when I was able to move along with my life, and start anticipating the wrap up of a sadly, average screening.\r\nTaking away everything that made the parent series so popular and lovable, the massive world-building, the built-up confrontation and the breathing surrounding the world, these two episodes enticed their gaze and providedmanufactory fan service that fed the ominous thirst some of the characters give off. I'm looking at you, Shuna.\u00a8\n\r\nTwo whole episodes of mindless guilty pleasure, what really sales most of the shows from this genre. I would argue that the second episode was the better one, screening the awaited \u201cbeach episode\u201d, while the first one had an erotic display of sumo wrestling, going as far as involving with butt-sumo-wrestling which couldn't stop me from thinking about Keijo!!!!!!!!. Trash only leads to trash. Either way; you can't really be harsh on an OVA, it was still fun and enjoyable. A lot of humor and \u201ccultured\u201d sightings. There is a huge audience for that.\n"
