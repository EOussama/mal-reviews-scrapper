    "content": "\n                Following the example of season one's bloopers, this collection builds up on top of season two in the same fashion. The same old snippets from the parent show with a spin of their own, I said this about the previous bloopers and I'll say it again, the fact that they are redrawing specific scenes and even add original content to pad them out is appreciated the effort that you don't see in a lot of recap-styled episodes.\n\r\nSome of the jokes presented were hilariously unexpected, very visually dependent, they sneak up on you when you're not ready until you find yourself laughing out loud from thestupidest thing you could imagine.\n"
