Seriously, remember those sad memes about cleaning products that look weirdly appetizing, like if they were candy? These look exactly like cleaning products, instead, they are actual candies, very off-putting, or at least in my eyes.\n\r\nIn fact, the original animations themselves look decent, nothing to complain about there, it's just the lack of creative integration with the show that is very disappointing, for example, there is a commercial where Dofflamingo, Luffy, and Law fight gets interrupted by acandy posing as a housewife, cleaning, and opera signing meanwhile her candy kid is on the couch. Probably watched said fight.\n\r\nThe rest of the commercials with the straw hats raising the candy box and screaming in excitement were generic enough not to care, but there you go, a One Piece candy commercial that has nothing to do with the franchise itself. We've seen better than this honestly.\n"
