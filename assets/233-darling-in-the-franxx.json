However, ever since summer 2018, a certain show has managed to stay relevant throughout the couple of years that have passed, havingpeople still admire what it brought, and nag what it didn't properly hit all the while I was trying to avoid the heated debates and laying to my self that I will never have to watch it anyways, that is until I randomly wanted to see some Mecha action, enter, Darling in the franXX. \n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nUnder the cover, the plot is just the common barebone kids piloting mechs to save the world, sucking on its sex references that drive 90% of the episodes, making you question the horny 13 years old who put together this mess of whining clueless tweens, however, the show slowly, but surely pushed me off my high horse and showed a massive potential for how great it can be, the world started to feel much more massive, with lore and history to it, making you ask questions and think about all sorts of things that might happen to the characters in the future and what predated them, until it decided to ignore all it built up and end off on the most anti-climactic resolution that left me and the majority of the audience facepalming. And for a story that might have mattered more, it hurts the overall perspective of the narrative. For the first 20 episodes, this show would have been no less than a solid 8, but the ending makes most of the show and it's what sticks out the most, it's unfortunate to see potential crumble just when you are starting to stan it.\n\r\nThe show follows a steady pace that varies from an incredibly fast-paced action frame to a slow and nourished info-dump with glimpses of episodic episodes that build up on top of each other. I appreciated how even the most irrelevant episode dropped hints and clues on what was going on the background all along, the show might have distracted us with a coming of age drama between immature tweens, but it was building up for a reveal that did not live up to the hype, unfortunately, but it doesn't hurt the attempt though, in fact, you could emit the last 4 or 5 episodes and still end up with a fun, good experience.\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, the story follows this group of kids, trained from as long as they can remember to fight against these destruction abominations called Klaxosaur in a battle to dominate the earth, or what's left of it, humans are driven to the edge of extinction, only managing to survive inside mobile fortresses, referred to as \u201cPlantations\u201d that each has an assigned force of \u201cParasytes\u201d that compose of a group of tweens/teens to protect it.\n\r\nI have to give credits though, I liked how the show goes a mile and justifies why the faith of humanity lies on Kids. It's definitely a common trope where your 15 years old character is tasked with saving the world or whatever where mighty military forces would fail, but in the perspective of the narrative and what we find later, it really makes sense to have none other than these kids do the job.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThe easiest I can put it into words, everything looks like soaked cany. The first thing that comes to mind is Zombieland Saga. The art style definitely strikes as a cute wholesome middle school slice of life, surprising you with how fluid and kind of sharp it changes when the call of battle is upon the characters. The character design was as generic as it can get, even for the protagonist, however, I would say, Zero Two and a certain character that appears later outclass everyone else in the show, at least, visually speaking.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI did not notice anything to pick on, vocally-wise, the voice acting lived up to the moments, the OSTs matched the action and the opening theme song was a party banger, it doesn't note please the ear on the first hear (at least for me), but it's definitely a grower.\r\nThe show also featured several ending theme songs they were brief and changed very fast, but there were at least a couple that really rolled the vibes.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nWhen I first started watching, and after being introduced to the main cast, I would say nobody caught my eyes or struck me as much as Zero Two did, the sight of her was enough to give extra attention every time she was on screen, and I would mainly blame that on character design, I swear Hiro, the protagonist even did not appear any different from a generic background crow character, especially when he stands besides lesser characters. His buddies were much more of a looker to the eyes, they had weight, their presence could be felt, unlike Hiro's cold and gloomy presence. In fact, while you would see in other shows how the surroundings change and sculpt the main character, it was totally the inverse here, Hiro changes everyone around him, but fails to do the same for himself, or at least, to a comparable degree. First-episode Hiro is not that much different of a person from episode-24 Hiro, but everyone else are \u201cwho are these new people\u201d. Heck, I would start hating or disliking a certain character, two episodes later after they get a min-redemption arc, they are already at the top of my favorites.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10)\r\nI honestly dived in just for the sake of moving this across to my \u201cwatched\u201d list and relate to the memes, I expected a generic watch though that I would have to force myself to finish in the next 3 months, I ended up binging it for under 6 days, and that's seeing a lot looking at my busy schedule. I laughed, I tore, I cheered, I speculated, this show kept me on the edge of my seat. My only dissatisfaction came from the resolution of the whole thing, however, I can't deny how well the suspense played through the whole run.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI do not consider myself big on Mecha, in fact, the only Mecha shows I've seen are this one and Code Geass, and both of theme I enjoyed for completely Mecha-unrelated things. I would really recommend watching this, granted, do not step in with huge expectations, do not expect a groundbreaking revelation or anything of that sort. Let the show lead you, and not the other way around. Maybe you will be one of the people that really stan with everything the show did, but even if you disliked the ending, everything that precedes it is still there.\n"
