    "content": "\n                This anime is a grueling fever-dream.\r\nIt's the perfect amount of generic that I would have been fine with a few years ago, perhaps, being in a certain age range would have made it possible for me to relate or even care to whatever was happening, but too many variables interchanging constantly with no breather at all killed the mood and excitement one can expect from such a show.\n\r\nKokoro Connect is a coming of age story that really target the teenage audience, is set in a school setting, featuring character hitting their puberty (maybe it was too much that they started explaining everything else as supernatural),all confused and rushed, hyperenergetic with a lot of emotional damage stress-stacked over the years.\r\nThe plot features somewhat of an interesting premise but fails miserably at keeping it exciting, it was as if the show was trying to punch you in the gut, pleading that you might spare some cheap tears, but it was far from happening for how frequent the plot relied on this sorry excuse of storytelling.\n\r\nThe characters were, well; you might have seen more interesting wooden planks in your backyard. Very generic, almost feel like a placeholder to some other more realized characters, not only the roles they played but even the visual design they inherit. The animation did not help either. Think of the most barebone not exciting art style, it's like a bootleg imitation of KyoAni.\n\r\nI would say that the first arc was very solid and a great start to the series, but in contrast, it set up too high of a ceiling for the rest of the series to keep up with. It all went downhill from the start.\n\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nArt (7/10)\r\nSound (7.5/10)\r\nCharacters (6/10)\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\r\nOverall (6.9/10)\n"
