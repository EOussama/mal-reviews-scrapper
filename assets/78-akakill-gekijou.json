As dark as the original turned out to be, many fans wished for a more lightweight comedy centered parody to light up the heart. And as bad the original turned up to be (facts) ONA had no effect on that.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nThe story as a leading aspect here was absent, but for a good reason, and that's what parodies are all about, instead, humor and jokes make up for that. It seemed as if all the jokes throughout the entire ONA were a direct reference going in sync withthe original, making fan of some characters just for the heck of it, trying desperately to push some laughs out of us, but unless you were a hardcore fan that you'd feel bad if you didn't laugh on the dry jokes, you would most of the time have a straight face of confusion, screaming \u201cWhy am I even watching this\u201d.\n\r\n- Art (6.0/10):\r\nNot the most aesthetic thing you will ever see that's for sure, but despite that, I feel there is a point behind it, you want to portray your characters in a cuter way, a more Chibi and minimalistic picture to compliment the childish humor, Which I understand, however, it could have been better, shows like \u201cAttack on Titan: Picture Drama\u201d did this better in my opinion.\n\r\n- Sound (4.0/10):\r\nYeah, I couldn't care less, there were no opening or ending theme songs to leave an impression, but because of the short length of the episode, there was no need for them anyways. It leaves us at the soundtrack collection which was totally non-existent. The voice acting wasn't a big deal here either, just a bunch of narration for a collection of dull jokes.\n\r\n- Character (0/10):\r\nThe parent show did horribly its characters, I remember rating it a 1/10, but this was way worse. So much for a parody, there was nothing that stands out, even the Chibi appearance wasn't fitting for most of them, I would argue only Kurome and Akame looked cute, the rest no so much. Lubbock was a straight out punching bag for physical abuse for no apparent reason, I don't know what even made them think that beating down someone is a funny sight to see, you'd think they would consider limiting it as much as possible as it would get old very fast, but no, the guy took the beating any way. And then comes Leone, of course, she didn't leave a good taste in my memory for what she did in the original show, but this was just despicable, nothing but a magnet for fanservice, that's all she was good for from the start.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (2.0/10):\r\nIf only I knew what I was signing up for, it was a total waste of time. I've seen better parody shows in my days, I guess I just hit bedrock with shitty parody shows here, I haven't cracked a smile, I haven't felt any good vibes around this or anything that made me think \u201cThis is fun\u201d. Other than hearing some familiar voices all over again, nothing cut the cake.\n\r\n- Overall (3.6/10):\r\nWell, I'm never recommending the original show anyway, why even bother with this one. And I totally understand that everybody has a unique taste, for the fans of the series out there that enjoyed it way more than I did, this is still not worthy of your time, but, if you still insisted on more content of the series, you might just give it a try, I won't promise anything though, it might end up ruining the series for you, or maybe the complete opposite, you might turn up to enjoy it somehow, and even manage to update your character qualities based on it.\n"
