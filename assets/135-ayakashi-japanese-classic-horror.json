A bait set up way backin 2006 and still did its number on me, but that was nothing compared to the impact some of the presented stories had, and given their origin is several centuries ago is only more astonishing.\r\n\u201cAyakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,\u201d tells three different stories from the of a traditional Japanese background that deals heavily on supernatural and spiritual concepts, something that still today far fetched and questionable to tackle. But as they say, not every apple in the barrel is a divine one.\n\n\r\nStory (7.8/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Stories of revenge have always been told by masses, probably because how relatable of a motive it is for most human beings, but not every outcome of it is served tidely. As cold as it philosophy behind it, it remains quite cheesy most of the time and hard to buy, and most of the time, easy to grasp. Person A holds grudge against person B and sets for revenge, it's how it's always been, so simple and yet unforgiving, right?\r\nYotsuya Kaidan took a more complicated approach to that by introducing a lot of key characters and a wider conflicting timeline of events by not only discussion a revenge quest but managing two related stories of the same depth with twists almost every ten minutes worth of material that it becomes quite predictable and overwhelming later on, it really wears out the storytelling and makes it somewhat less interesting, like how fast major turnouts are introduced. Had it been a longer series, it would have definitely worked out for the better.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (7/10): Love stories are probably the most common type of storytelling that comes from tradition, it's not only a source of honesty and pride but also a drug that renders the most honorable of men into a brainless addict looking for the sweet overdose of meth that is his lover.\r\nWhat started as a casual honest Samurai with a respectable wage, and a loving girlfriend, ended up as a controversial cheater of a kind he never predicted. The story felt pretty plain for the most part, but it was the execution that made it stand out a little bit.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.5/10): Probably the only faithful entry out of the three for the word \u201chorror\u201d in the series' title. As short and concise as it was, started out of nowhere and made itself wrap up very quickly making you begging for more (Mononoke is a spin-off of this 3 episodes long tale, thank God there is more.). Both horrifying and saddening, and at the same time beautiful (Visually, more on that later) and fun, it tackles the story of a mysterious medicine seller that tries to exorcize a monster targetting a select members of a household, trying his best to drag the darkest secrets they were keeping, the secrets that made the monster look nothing more than a cute kitten compared to what they truly were.\n\n\r\nArt (6.6/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (7.5/10): In my opinion, out of the three stories, this one had the most realistic artistic choice, not only its use of dark colors and gloomy lighting and shading was toned down to compliment the portrayed era, but people's anatomy and facial expressions were more or less on point with the heavy use of Japanese attire of course. Speaking about the art style here and not the animation, as the latter was an entirely other story while nothing mind-blowing, it managed to keep you focused on what's important.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (4.5/10): This series was seriously a let down when it came to visuals, and the visual alone is probably the most important aspect that an Anime should master, not only is it the magnet for a new audience but it's what carries the plot ahead. The character anatomy was just horrible, talking here about the faces, most the most part, they were distorted and poorly traced, they felt very cheap and lazy, and that's not to talk about the bad use of colors and shading, it was like setting up a high value for gamma output on an old display device, it was just horrible. Could as well make it to my top-poorly-animated list.\n\r\nBakeneko (8/10): While not as realistic as the first story's, Bakeneko is definitely the winner here, talking artistically. Everything felt like staring at an old Japanese abstract painting that has taken some beating from time.\r\nHowever, don't let the old atmospheric touch of weariness fool you because it can suddenly fill the screen with beautifully animated frames that make your eyeballs almost jump out and eat the sweet candy it sees in front of it.\r\nI'm talking about some serious webgen level animation that might sound from this paragraph like it won't fit the portrayed style, but believe me, that was some of the best-animated sequences I've seen.\n\n\r\nSound (8.1/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (8/10): The soundtracks in this one highlighted the revenge aspect tackled by the story very well and that didn't fall short on delivering a great performance from the voice acting cast's part, they surely were some talented individuals.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (8/10): Despite the poor production animation-wise, they really did this show justice when it came to vocals in general that I feel like the voice acting cast did the series a great deed by having it finally stand on its own, some great performances those were, the sound of a desperate couple confessing, the madness on a wife watching her husband cheating on her, all of those feelings were just so natural.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.5/10): The medicine seller's voice actor, need I say more? And that's not to say that the others fell short on delivering, well, he was surely the stare of the performance, the way he calmly talks, it highlights how the animation had his face muscles move, you could almost swear the said frame is alive and consciously talking. The sound effects were another thing. They had a heavy use on scattered camera focus to help convoy the horror element of the story, and sound effects played a huge role in racing that to being even more impactful and horror-worthy. Nothing of the cheesy jump scares sfx or anything like that.\n\n\r\nCharacter (7.1/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Just what I like about a well-written plot. Interesting enough character to complement the events, I mean, if you're doing a world-class commercial, you're best to have a modal feature your merchandise than a normal fella passing through the street.\r\nAs wide as the character cast was, and given the complex background they came from, even for a western head that's foreign to the Japanese culture was able to connect and understand their motive. Most of them at least is a well developed and fleshed out as both key and side characters.\r\nThe bad folks aren't bad just because, they are given a reason, something that defies the classic rotten bad guy, after all, everyone is born pure but then decides what route to take.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (6/10): I mean, I want to say that I've seen more interesting wooden planks, mostly for how amusingly humiliating it is, but also for how really blunt a character they were. Aside from the Goddess Tomi Hime, we never got any characters that actually explained their origins to back up their decisions later, and even the Goddess after fleshing out herself still didn't make any sense for how she ended up like and how everybody involved just coped with it. A lot was left open for interpretation and it wasn't even justified why.\n\r\nBakeneko (7.5/10): I would have loved if they presented more intriguing figures, the medicine seller was really one of a kind, without a doubt, the best character from all of the stories. But one character couldn't possibly make an excuse for every other character, right?\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): It was certainly more of a chore at the beginning to keep up with complex Japanese names (I'm from an entirely different cultural background myself, so no wonder), but once you get past that, you get a lot of thrilling moments and shocking plot twists. Very immersive, just the type of show that gets better and better on every re-watch as you get more familiar with the characters and the historical background of the told story.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (6.5/10): Not quite as good compared to the other two, but still a better love story than Twilight for sure. The characters were far interesting for me to care about and the art style and animation didn't help either.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.3/10): I was totally treated to something I never was ready for. Before diving into it, I had the first story \u201cTetsuya Kaidan\u201d as my favorite, but as soon as I got into it I knew that wasn't the case anymore. This story did a lot of things right and it was only 3 episodes, the shortest one out of the three. I loved the medicine seller as a character and I adored the premise behind the story and the theme it handled perfectly. If I was going to recommend this series, Bakeneko is probably going to make 70% of the decision.\n\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): Really amazing revenge story with its own twists and unique conclusion that breaks the fourth wall even, a definitive classic for me.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (6.4/10): It did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I would probably end up forgetting about it in a matter of months, if any time I'm re-watching the series, this certainly wouldn't be something to look forward to.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.1/10): Certainly one of my all-time favorites now, and I would totally re-watch it like crazy from this point on.\n\r\nIf you're going to watch the series, I highly recommend watching all three arcs on your own decision and decide for yourself, after all, I could just be a sucker for real horror and not so much for romance, you can never know.\n"
