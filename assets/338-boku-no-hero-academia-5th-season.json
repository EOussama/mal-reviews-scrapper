    "content": "\n                I see a lot of people complaining about how this show had the audacity to break Geneva conventions, some claiming they lost their family to it, had their lives ruined, and famine spread through their homeland, because of this show. Cover your ears and let them bark and go on with your life.\n\r\nPeople get salty too quickly, and over nothing, worst-case scenario, they paid a lifestreaming service to watch this season alone, but we know it's already much more peaceful than that.\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is gonna My Hero Academia, what did you expect? When has the show done anything else in 4 seasons prior? Thefirst half of the season is a decent display of Class 1-A vs. Class 1-B, decent, at times even great, such a good time competing over something wholesome, what more do you need?\r\nRight after, we get more exposition about the Todoroki family, from where I thought the show really picked up. It was delivered beautifully, showing both Endeavor and his family's perspectives.\r\nAnd then, there was the fabled My Villain Academia, it was on par with the best parts of the whole franchise.\n\r\nThe animation stepped up when it needed to do so, it was great, dynamic, lively, and full of energy. The Voice acting too did not shy from delivering on the full emotional impact that was delivered.\n\r\nI genuinely say, as a far from being a fan of the franchise, and as a casual My Hero Academia watcher, this was a lot of fun. We get a mini-tournament, a character exposition, and then twist after twist. Oh, did I even mention, the whole thing starts off by dropping one of the biggest twists in the series? There you go.\n\r\nOverall, that's an easy 8.4/10 season, watch it for yourself and judge, and don't stress over other people's bashful opinions, although,; you could say I'm also being bashful of other people's opinions about the show. I hope this does not come up as a rant, if it did, Apologies.\n"
