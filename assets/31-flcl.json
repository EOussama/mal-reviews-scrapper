You really have to be fully focused on what's going on, because the authors like to present the story in a very unique, but weird manner, it almost looks like juxtaposition a bunch of nonsense and hardcoding a storyline that barely makes sense most of the time, if it ever does, but trust me on this, this is an animated METAPHOR, and a great one that we all can relate to.\n\r\nThe story follows the main protagonist, a stereotypical boy in elementary school, still on the crucial evolving into the creature we all are and/or once were, a teenager, Takkun, as he's referred to by several of the characters, is a boy dying of boredom in his small town, that nothing out of the ordinary ever happens at, he feels so empty spending time with his brother's girlfriend who went away from home to follow his dreams.\n\r\nThe events of the story will, for the most part, mock-up and ridicule all sorts of aspect that we get to experience while growing up, and surprisingly enough, sexual content is a huge part of it. if you really thought about it, this is a story about overcoming the differences, depression is the real cancer, and curing that, requires a strong heart indeed.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nWhere to even start in this one, goes to show, that shows these days have no excuse for slacking off, (looking at you One Piece and folks).\r\nFor the longest time, I've been a collector of aesthetic pictures and GIFs, those images that really make you stare at them and melting in your thoughts, this show is like a mine where there's nothing but the sweet rare aesthetics, where you could pause any episode, and have a chance of 90% to capture a wonderful aesthetic image.\r\nThe animation and art style does vary alongside the story's progression, at times even parodying some popular shows like South Park.\n\r\n- Sound (10.0/10):\r\nMost definitely, the strongest aspect, and the part that makes it dozens of times better than its competitors, every single song (and there is a wide selection to go through) is fantastic as a standalone record, but they way they easily blend and compliment the yet very unique art style and fluid animation is just luxurious on its own.\n\r\n- Character (7.5/10):\r\nNot so many great characters really, with only 6 episodes available, and the very fast paced nature of the show, it's reall hard to get to know the characters very well, but similar to the speed of the story, the character developmenet is also a killer actor here, one in particular that drew me in the most, was the girl called Mamimi, she struggles with forgetting the past, getting over what happened with her ex, and her crazy addiction to smoking are relatable in a sense, and I'm not a smoker myself, and never been, and yet, there is a connection about redemption, are we all fair in love and war? who knows, but we are all tasting the same bitter aroma of hardship.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nSaying I didn't enjoy the show would be a sin to keep ahold of, there are a lot of flaws here and there, we can't neglect what's the show really excels at, for once, the music is just spectacular, what else? the animations are just as complementary to that, enough to keep your brain busy on the screen, people might get easily bored with the simplistic story in the display, and don't let the excessive sexual content at times distract you from the real message\u201cS\u201d, this was an amazing ride, a shame it's not that family friendly, or else, I was going to straight rewatch it with friends and family.\n\r\n- Overall (8.4/10):\r\nDefinitely worth a rewatch several times, because as I stated before, it's really hard to follow and keep track with the progression of the story, and that's apparent from the first watch, a third or maybe a fourth would get me to understand better, and probably by then, I would even have a different read on this, but as for now, it had an effect on me, how to view things currently I'm living through, It's been a great binge-watch.\n"
