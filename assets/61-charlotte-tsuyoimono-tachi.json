Charlotte: Tsuyoimono-tachi, aired the 30th Mars 2016 is a special one-shot episode that exists just for that, to feed the hungry fans. But does it taste good?\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nThe special episode follows the student council as they are trying to solve a problem with a mind reader that can't seem to turn off her ability, and thus makingeverybody around her fight. Nao and Yuu set up to helping her of course while keeping a close distance from her, they start to read each other's minds as a means to get to know one another the best, but it doesn't go as smooth as one might expect.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nJust like the parent series, I can't seem to remember a flaw I encounter, a dragged on anatomy or right animation, it was a good Charlotte/10. The character design for the mind reader was great though, so detailed that she could have a show of her own as a protagonist.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nI've never been a huge fan of the main cast, to begin with, especial as soon as I discovered that Nao has the same voice actress of Gasper (High School DxD), and you know, I'm not big on traps either.\r\nIt was cool for me to get to see the opening theme song again, but I guess that was it.\n\r\n- Character (6.5/10):\r\nAs I've always said, this show lacks consistency when it comes to the characters as 95% of them are not memorable at all, and I've seen short series do better, for instance, FLCL, leaving no excuse for Charlotte to slack off. Nothing too special seemed to happen here aside from the protagonist being more of a punching bag than he was during the main show.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nNot my proudest special watch, to be honest, it was almost like being forced to stare at drying paint while not having slept for days, it was hard to keep up as nothing interesting in particular was hitting the spot, I could go for hours starring at the Whole Cake chateau collapsing (One Piece) and not get this bored, it was just another standalone episode that couldn't even stand on its own.\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\r\nIf you have something better to do, just skip over on this, absolutely nothing happens in favor of progressing the plot as this is not a sequel, and it's set somewhere between the third and sixth episode, right after Yusarin joined, but before *SPOILER AHEAD*; Ayumi passed away.\n"
