    "content": "\n                Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken always felt like a lighthearted comedy slide of life until I watched Tensura Nikki, with all the action and lore stuff moved aside, the difference does show up, and that without even having to bring the change in art style in the discussion. You really never see the show for what it is until you watch this much, toned down, easy to follow, slow-paced episodic peek into the characters' lives.\n\r\nThe art style speaks of itself, it dumbs down the composition of everything visual, so much so that it brings back out character under a new brush so much so thatthe entire framework feels different, but that's not entirely bad as it does make for the cutest, most hearing baby goblins ever.\n\r\nThe comedy feels not much different from what we're used to from the show, some of it even comes up as a rehearsal of an already told joke in the parent show, only louder.\r\nThe characters are the same, only with all guards lowered and lunch more down to earth, it was a fresh coat of paint all in all.\n\r\nThe episodes felt very slow-paced, snail speed, I do not recommend binging this one at all, it really works better under a weekly show, slow and relaxing, it really does affects your experience the way you try to approach it.\n\r\nI feel like, especially compared to giants of a slice of life shows, this really does pale in comparison, it comes with nothing new to the table and is just there, extra filler for your favorite Isekai fantasy age of empires Anime.\n\r\nOverall: 6.6/10\n"
