It was the latter that elevated his status and put him in the mainstream field so much so that people started attributing the clich\u00e9 childhood love stories to him and his legacy.\n\r\nSet in early 2000, at a time where technology was nowhere as accessible and as widespread, writing letters was still relevant and communication over long distances was still a hit or miss.\n\r\nByousoku 5 Centimeters is an anthology that accompaniesthe childhood friends Takaki and Akari as their deal with their long-distance relationship over the years, the three episodes used to separate their life phases that go from childhood and teenage years to young adulthood, it's a personal story of self-growth and anticipation, you can either fight and make sacrifices for the person you love or move on, not doing either of those things will only slow your self-development and leave you hanging for years on end.\n\r\nMost of the plot is told through whispering inner-monologues that almost echo back to the speaker only highlighting their loneliness and distance from their loved one, add to that the large and empty environment, be it an unbusy room or an open field that rushes beyond the horizon, adding to that loneliness and desperation.\n\r\nBecause of this ever-lasting curse, the person who could not move on (Takaki) not only hurt himself but also third parties that got involved along the way like Kanae.\n\r\nOverall: 8.4\n"
