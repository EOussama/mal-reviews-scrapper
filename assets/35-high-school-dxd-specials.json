    "content": "\n                High School DxD Specials was a compilation of shorts, formed into 6 3 to 5 minutes long episodes, that dive deeply into the craziness of the parent story, which would be fanservice, this is fanservice at its finest, like never before in the parent series...\n\r\n- Story (3.0/10):\r\nAbsolutely no story going here, just them doing their every-day vague tasks, with an extremely unusual amount of focus on fanservice, this is even more hardcore than the main series that tried its best to give the story a shot.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nThe animation was as nice as the main show, even a bit more enhanced seeing how these areall short animations, the physics are just as crazy as ever, the geographical anatomy and everything was just the way we used it to be.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nThe same excellent soundtracks, but unfortunately, due to the short length of the episodes, we rarely get to enjoy them, the ending theme song was amazing for once, very cowboy-like.\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\r\nThe same old vague characters, seriously, you can't expect a short to improve on the main story in such a short time span.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.0/10):\r\nThis at least was more of an enjoyment to the plot to me, while the parent series gave the best it could to the fanservice, but still considered the plot to be relevant, this one understood exactly that nobody gave a shit about the plot, and rather the fanservice, so they delivered a 100% echi black magic to satisfy are unfortunate perverted  nature.\n\r\n- Overall (6.2/10):\r\nI wouldn't really recommend this unless you're a pervert-hungry material fan, all the fanservice they couldn't fit into the parent show is here, and I thought the parent show was rocketing.\n"
