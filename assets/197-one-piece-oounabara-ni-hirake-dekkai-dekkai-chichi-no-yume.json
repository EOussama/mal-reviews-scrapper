    "content": "\n                When it comes to One Piece, I always fall into the bias trap, for me personally, it is really hard to criticize what makes up my all times favorite franchise, but then again, sickness has to be called off. For a One Piece episode, movie, filler, OVA, ONA, special, anything, this was on the lowly low. I'm of course excusing the art department in this one as the time period of its release was never famous for that, it's the setting that was lacking, the oddness, the randomness, the goofiness, it wasn't there.\n\r\nWhen starting to watch any One Piece related content, you always come preparedto see some giant cheek clapping (Meaning it in an SFW way), colossal occupies dancing, eerie monsters walking down the street, reading a paper may be, it is always something out of the norm, but this was was a complete disappointment when it came to that, the only goofy thing was the villain's hairstyle, and it was not enough.\n"
