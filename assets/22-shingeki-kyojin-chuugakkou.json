I just have so much to say about this show as a whole, I figured out I might as well make a full-fledged review and call it a day.\n\r\nImaging going through every big moment in the Attack on Titan franchise, bit by bit, and turning the saddest and serious plot points into the most hilarious in context jokes, put it simply, this is just a huge meme of a show.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nAs the story starts, this is an alternative timeline, whereall the events of the story take a more comedy-oriented approach, no over gory deaths, and none of that, just pure Attack on Titan memes.\r\nAll your typical familiar faces from the original shaw and OVAs make a comeback, It's about school struggles, and activities along the way, very basic story progression that focuses more on telling jokes than development.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nVery basic chibi art, but in a super cute way, (but not as cute as Attack on Titan drama pictures), the animation is very subtle;, really nothing remarkable to mention here, other than the phenomenal camera movements on some parts, and the great use of CG and particle effects.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nI can't get enough of the original opening's ripoff, and the same can be said about the ending song too. the soundtrack is just as strong, and the voice acting is on point, man, I just love Sasha's voice act, among all of the characters, she has the perfect one for a chibi makeover.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nMy, very hilarious  recreations, what I really adore about this cast, is the comeback of characters from the OVAs, like for instance, Ilse, Isabel, and Farlan, not only the human characters are amazing, but also the Titans as a counterparts, yes, there is a supposed -best-titan in this show, and they bring a lot of joy to see in a more goofy way.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nThe humor is what makes this show stand out, it's just pure (sometimes hysterical) laughter one after the other. the humor is very easy to catch on with, as far as I know, every typical Attack on Titan fan would get a grasp on it, it really enjoyment comes from real event recreations, the ripoffs and references are killing it.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nAs much as I love this show, and willing to recommend it to basically everyone, there is a very specific audience that this show is aimed at, as a big Attack on Titan fan, having watched the two original seasons and OVAs for no less than 3 times, I found some jokes to be very hard to catch upon unless you know the references very well, only then, the humour flash would trigger you up.\n"
