Maybe we were too harsh on him, maybe we shouldn't have said all of those negative things about his work, come to think of it, his original work was always good, but this one tops it off and showing his true potential.\n\r\nThat analogy is everything but SAO. The first project is the original series, people decided to hate on it, and to fatten the hate and ignorance, even more, the second season received the same if not a worse treatment, Alicization, in this case, is the second ambitious project that corrects all of the previous entries' faults, that is, until Mr. handyman, Reki Kawahara himself decides to add pieces of pineapples atop for some reason, and everything he built up fell off in an instant like it never even mattered.\r\nWhy pineapples? That is very random, yes, just like whatever happened in this season, it's stupid, it's random and very unnecessary.\n\r\nHere is why...\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nIt's undeniable the effort and dissection thought-out structure that Alicization started off with, very intriguing spin on the whole VR practices that had gone repetitive on the previous entries until it ended off with a satisfying conclusion that's very proud with the cliffhanger it concluded on, leaving us wanting and begging for a continuation, something that really put a lot of pressure on the continuation, it has to be at least as good or else, what does it even matter.\n\r\nSomething I really want to admire this season for bravely doing, and somewhat nailing was the shift from focusing on Kirito as the main motivator for the plot's progression to other lesser characters.\r\nNow, for the frustrating part. What happened to common sense and careful thinking?\r\nNow, SAO has always had some very visible plot holes that honestly do not affect the way the plot runs and is set up as, there are a few things here and there, but this season upped that up a great deal. A great but frustrating example was the whole Soul Translator gear and the exclusivity to the Underworld that makes you wonder if the writer even cares any more. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go on more detail of how exactly that hurt the credibility of this story, but man, did that single-handedly drop this plot from an 8/10 to a rediculous 6/10.\r\nHonestly, despicable.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nLately, A1-Picture has been stepping up their game with SAO, and it shows clearly in the couple last seasons. You thought the last season was phenomenally animated, this one is straight-up MAD sakuga compilations at this point, big and hype fights every episode, something that really calls out the talent of the animation team.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nI praised the OST for the first time in Alicization. Did they improve even more or what? Maybe because this one relied on a lot of battle and combat to sellout the plot, that is, a lot of impact shocks, piercings and magic chants to compose, they definitely stick out the most.\r\nUnlike the previous entries, the opening was okay, however, the ending though, definitely the best in the series from what goes from visuals and song. LISA is such a talented individual.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nMaybe the selling point of this show. The Kirito boycott if you will.\r\nNo, but seriously, to take out the main character of the entire franchise and still have a solid plot that's round-out very well (until the last two episodes that is) goes to show how amazing the side supporting characters are. Not only the human knights but also the Dark Territory soldiers. Every fluctlight individual sold his or her role perfectly, having to empathize with both sides can only be explained by the great character development and good personified writing if anything. It goes to question, would be born on the wrong piece of land make you the bad guy? Are the humans the heroes here because we, the viewers are humans ourselves, and though, it's easier to relate to what's familiar?\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nMy journey with SAO started with that of curiosity, why is this series hated so much, and why is it, despite that, so popular. I have come to compose my own relationship with SAO, a hate and love relationship that's primarily driven from my disappointment. I wanted the franchise to be good because it really had the potential to be amazingly good.\r\nWhen I first watched Alicization I had a great deal of happiness because finally, this series is being set on the perfect track, but then to see the much-awaited for sequel destroy all of that really hurt the experience, it's not that I hated the season from the get-go, I actually enjoyed it, although not as much as I enjoyed Alicization, it wasn't until the last two episodes when I just couldn't deal with the stupid twists, they really ruined the mood and let me in such severe disappointment.\n\r\nWith that out of the way, this season, or war if you will have some great moments for all sorts of characters from both sides of the conflict. We get to see a lot of their abilities, attitudes, aspirations, it was a great shift from a solo character-focused series to a group of people, each with different goals in life.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nI mean, if you're considering watching this, you've already made it through the best, the bad, and the stupid of SAO, 12 more episodes to seal off the series (for now) isn't going to be a bad investment, but it's by no means perfect. It leaves out a lot to be desired, doesn't live up to the hype. Definitely the same SAO though, just more action and stripped out politics.\n"
