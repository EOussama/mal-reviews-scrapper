The captivating art style and vibrant colors provided a visual feast that made every panel a delight to behold. The vertical paneling format was a perfect fit for the story, enhancing the reading experience and drawing me deeper into its world.\n\r\nWhile Sung Jin Woo may not be the most complex or grounded character, he served as a fantastic protagonist, offering a much-needed respite from reality. However, it was the side characters that truly stolethe spotlight. Like in One Punch Man, their presence and interactions added depth and substance to the story, leaving me craving for more.\n\r\nThe initial 80 chapters of Solo Leveling were particularly impressive, setting a high standard that the series had to maintain. The small-scale scope and significant risks created an intriguing narrative, and the mystery surrounding \"the system\" sparked my curiosity, keeping me invested in the story's progression.\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that some people dismiss Solo Leveling as a mere imitation of other great works, particularly during the Jeju Island Raid arc. While it may have drawn inspiration from Hunter x Hunter and similar series, Solo Leveling managed to carve out its own identity and deliver an enjoyable experience.\n\r\nHowever, I must admit that as the series progressed and approached its endgame, I found it to be somewhat underwhelming and repetitive. The introduction of the Monarchs overshadowed the side characters, rendering them irrelevant in the face of these formidable threats. The ending, in my opinion, felt rushed and lacked the excitement and intrigue that the series had built up over time. Undoubtedly, the peak of Solo Leveling was in its earlier chapters, where the story was at its most captivating.\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Solo Leveling remains a thrilling journey worth embarking upon. The remarkable art, compelling protagonist, and memorable side characters make it a Manhwa that stands out in the crowded landscape of the genre. It may not have maintained the same level of excellence throughout its entirety, but the high points it reached in the first part of the series make it a memorable and enjoyable read.\n"
