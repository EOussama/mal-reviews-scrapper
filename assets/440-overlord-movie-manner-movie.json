And the fact that there are slight differences between the two releases just shows how dedicated the production team is to delivering a unique experience for fans. Get ready to see some spooky sneers from Shalltear and maybe even a rare smile. It's time to sit back, relax, and enjoy the manners movie like a true Overlord fan.\n\r\nI'm sure this is about to bore you out, so here's a little fun fact about rabbits.\r\nRabbits are actuallyexcellent swimmers! They have been known to swim in lakes and even tread water in order to reach food or escape predators.\n"
