I\u2019m sure nothing can go wrong, right?\n\r\nIt was \u2026 wrong and for the wrong reasons too.\n\r\nThis is one of those \u201cIt\u2019s me, not you\u201d cases. Horimiya\u2019s concept is very much grounded and has clear expectations. A wholesome slice of life snip from the youthful high school days of two sweethearts, anyone can like that, and that\u2019s why the first season has gathered such a curl following to an extent. However, with that promise, a sequel came in, only, not conforming to those sequel-esque qualities. Let me cut to the chase and just saythat this is not a sequel, and more so a retrospective (recap?) outlook on the major events that have folded in the first season. Think of it as some sort of deleted scene, an extended version of what you enjoyed before, only, it wasn\u2019t that enjoyable.\n\r\nIt felt like a filler season, you already know the outcome but here\u2019s more topping, so to speak. It goes to say that if you aren\u2019t reaaaaaaaly into Horimiya, then this one is putting you through a coma of boredom. And that\u2019s despite the animation being high quality and the sound design as well, the directing was top-notch, but even all of that can\u2019t make watching paint on a wall drying any more exciting.\n\r\nOverall: 6.32/10.\n"
