    "content": "\n                Part 2 of Dr. Stone New World was an exhilarating journey that continues the adventure and flourishing of the science kingdom under the ever-increasing influence of Senku. Although, as some might think, what started as a semi-realistic science-based adventure is slowly becoming a mystical sci-fi thriller that no one expected, but everyone should have seen coming solely based on the hook of episode one of season one.\n\r\nI was always skeptical about the action part of the show, especially when the main character is not the OP battle type that pulls up Shounen powerups when it\u2019s convenient, however, they came through and delivered one of thebest Shounen mind battles I\u2019ve seen in place. Ibara and Senku\u2019s cat and mouse back and forth was a masterclass on strategic warfare, psychological tactical nukes keep up the pace, each one of them constantly at each other\u2019s throats even when they are not on each other\u2019s field of vision. A battle of minds invisible to the physical measures, but very much present on the narrative plane.\n\r\nAnimation held it\u2019s own, but then again, it was never a strength of the show, clearly other aspects are the bigger draw here, but the animation was at no point a hindrance, it is of decent quality that may not elevate the show but certainly, never in the way.\n\r\nThe voice acting however was a snake to be had, with all the complex 5d-chess moves Senku and Ibara are pulling left and right, you\u2019d be expecting some heavy monologuing to fill in all the silence, and what a suspenseful monologuing it was, ironically, the characters felt more alive and animated when their mouths were shut.\n\r\nI felt like character-wise, the new characters like Amaryllis were kind of just there for me, however, the prize goes to the deeper exploration of Kohaku and Ginro as support characters that actually pull off sacrifices that move the plot forward. Obviously, it could have been better, but the whole season felt like an action-mind thriller more so than character-focused.\n"
