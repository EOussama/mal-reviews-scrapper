I wanted the show to be good, I wanted it to live up to its synopsis, but it seems, I gambled every hype I had at the time on its name, but this talk is especially directed at the first season, the gateway to it all. I have stressed long enough on the review for the first season on everything bad it did.\r\nSeason two, on the other hand, brings a lot of improvement to the table, but also slacks on some other, but the fact of the matter stays; the secondseason is a polished, more serious flavor of the first season.\n\r\nStory (6.7/10):\r\nA major convenience this season had over the previous one was the adoption of a more linear timeline that doesn't shift the focus too much. No excessive flashbacks that interrupt the action, but rather, those are initiated with a bit of a build-up that doesn't throw off the mood and attention.\r\nThe plot concludes on an open note, making an end to many plot threads and goals it set up at the start, but also raises a new question to - God protect us - a potential continuation of the story. That said, the plot does wrap, it does pay respect to the characters sacrificed throughout the run, it does eradicate the danger it was attempting to prevent.\r\nI feel like the classical linear progression really helped shape a clearer, more enjoyable sit through of a story, favoring the backlash random timeline shifting to more character-focused gimmicks that definitely helped put some respect on the name of a few characters that were perceived as \u201cuseless\u201d in the first season, *cough* Free *cough*.\n\r\nArt (7.8/10):\r\nI have been debating over this internally with myself, but I'm pretty sure the series knew a visual downgrade in terms of visual fidelity that we've grown to appreciate from the previous season. Aside from the highlights, characters look deformed, extremely idle and lazy at times with dead eyes and soulless faces.\r\nThe use of CGI continues still, but I can't help but point out how well they improved on hiding it, and making its use more uncommon compared to the first season.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nFairy Gone has always had a consistent visual and vocal bundle, but unlike the visuals that have known a dip in quality on a general note, the vocals, dare I say, are objectively better. I still can't decide between both seasons' openings and endings theme songs, both had a pair of party bangers for sure, however, from what covers the voice acting, the second season surely takes the cake. This season had a lot of resolutions set, so naturally, it was almost a constant emotional roller coaster for the main characters that required professional voice acting that touches, tingles, and pleasures your audible strings. The desperate screams were convincing.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nWhat I hated about this franchise the most, right after the nightmarish CGI spam was its collection of uninteresting characters. But hear me out.\r\nOn the visual level, they do please the eye, the designs are great and all, but the personality is almost non-existent. And I say almost. The first season had me confused as if I was sitting through a narrated story while looking at motionless dolls, this season was threatened with the same fate, but it luckily overcame it.\r\nFree, yes, the useless badass looking agent of Dorothea pulled down the cover that was slowing him down and actually showed some personality. He had a voice that can be heard, a vision that can be respected, and a body that acts instead of barking. The rest of the cast followed in his footsteps, and that alone highlighted a lot about the character, making me half-regretful from doubting the previous season.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nI realized midway the first season that I had made a grave mistake by part-taking on this franchise' hype train. The series was planned to serialize in 24 episodes, but then was split into two cours that had a season-length break in-between, I was struck, disappointed, and really annoyed from the fact that I will have to dedicate time for this boring shitshow that I had just barely finished the first season of, but perhaps, that break was just the right drive the franchise needed to improved and realize its mistakes. The result? A far better package that delivered and polished on every little thing I nitpicked on my review of the first season. It was an unexpectedly welcomed seasonal addition to my library, to say the least, it even had me think about rewatching the series from start to finish again, this time, with a full picture perception.\n\r\nOverall (7.1/10):\r\nI feel like Fairy Gone is one of those shows that I'll keep to myself, one of those shows that I don't feel like recommending to friends and not. Of course, my perspective is not absolute, it can be flawed, it can be changed, hell, who knew if this became one of my favorite shows if a rewatch was all I had to give it, but until then, Fairy Gone is not... gone, and I, at least at this moment, don't wish for its return. OVA and special episodes that expand on some of the cast will be welcomed any time though.\n"
