    "content": "\n                For a behemoth series such as Attack on Titans, what started as just another seasonal adrenaline rush and is currently on the verge of becoming a modern classic, the recalling of events is a must in order to fully grasp the complex story it tells. A huge political and emotional crash that raises the bar on each arc, so much has happened in the three seasons already, and the fourth and the last is just around the corner, any anybody wanted to watch up, there is no better time than now.\n\r\nThis 2 hours long screening recalls the past events, recapping what it can fit inthe time frame from all three seasons which highlights perfectly the tension and the tone change that the series has gone through perfectly.\n\r\nThey could have cramped more into it, but as it stands, definitely the best recap movie in the entire series. And there have been several average ones.\n"
