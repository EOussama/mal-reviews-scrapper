    "content": "\n                After a grueling waiting period, the finale of the finale season of the giant, Attack on Titan comes to a close. It feels like the series so far has explored it all, good guys vs. bad guys, then good guys vs. seemingly good but actually twisted guys to again switch the good and the bad entirely until it\u2019s a gray blend of right and wrong, which one can argue it was the appeal of the story, many struggling sides with no clear \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d in sight, or at least, not on a surface level. But then comes this final installment and twists it assuch Eren Yeager turning on all, friends and foes alike.\n\r\nIt\u2019s very underrated how the tension is always high and the unpredictability is constant, all overshadowed by a bittersweet farewell to the characters who have become as familiar as real people around us throughout the years, every small and big choice made in the past is finally materializing into harsh consequences before our eyes, an armageddon if you will. \n\r\nThe animation talk was very controversial even since the final season started airing, the aggressive 3D reliance scared off a lot of loyal fans, but I think this final installment finally figured it out, it feels so invisible yet very pronounced that it doesn\u2019t even make itself apparent until you start looking for it. All in all, it did not take away anything from the action, instead it elevated it and highlighted the fast pace, microsecond reactions, and decisions that the characters had to keep up in order to keep up with the world-ending event that was being carried out.\n\r\nIt was really a goodbye letter, not just to the world, not just to the characters, but also to the audience. Despite what many loud and angry people say, the story was concluded in the most inoffensive way it could have been taking into account how big everything escalated at the end. Sometimes, a bittersweet, cold conclusion is what it takes to pass the wrap around a timeless modern classic.\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10.\n"
