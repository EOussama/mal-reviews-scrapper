Normally, you'd release a recap episode that goes prior to watching the movie but no, I guess the material they wanted to cover could not stretch appropriately to movie pacing.\n\r\nThe story at hand follows the continuation of where the Anime left off, so you could say, this is more of a sequel than a spin-off movie, it tackles the legendary party of adventurers that they have been building up since episode one and gives a motive for Goblin Slayer and his parties to get involved. The arc was just another Goblin Slaying/Rescue operation that had the parties o the usual, infiltrate a Goblin nest and hack n' slash until they make it to the boss, only rehashing with nothing new, it feels more like a grinding sided-mission that buys-off time for \u201csomething\u201d to happen.\n\r\nFor a movie, the animation was more or so, lackluster, this could have been easily a three episodes sequel and nobody would have complained.\n"
