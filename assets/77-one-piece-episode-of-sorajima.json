Talking about One Piece, we all have come to know that the anime adaptation gets its share of weekly beat up from the studio, the Manga and Anime are like night and day, two sides of the same coin that's one is waybelow the other in terms of quality. Not even the original adaptation of the Skypea arc from the anime from way back had managed to live up to the viewers' expectations and was infamously regarded by a great number of fans to be one of the worst arcs in term of pacing. But at least, this special does leave you appreciating how faithful the anime was to the source material when the Skypea arc was first animated.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nWe all know what the arc was about, so spare the lengthy introduction.\r\nWe all know Skypea was prequel'd by the beloved mini-arc Jaya, they just had to skip through 95% of it to rush into the sky island stuff, which is understandable enough, for instance, there are no light spots on either Teach or Bellamy, and let's, of course, no forget the two Monkey brothers that were affiliated with Montblanc Cricket, they were included on some still images though, but never were given any proper introduction. Not just that, but also many rememberable things were skipped liked the classic Zoro Tarazan screen (classic), and the scene where Wiper destroyed Enel with a reject Dial to only restart his heart and come back from the dead, we never got introduced to how the Skypeans live and how things are being ruled over up in the sky. Things like Ganfall meeting the straw hat and Satori fighting Luffy, Sanji and Ussop were changed entirely.\r\nEverything felt very out of place and in the wrong chronological order, sometimes you're put into a flashback, and then immediately skip a lot of (important) content to only find yourself following some of the major battles which almost all were only still images, that looked lazy, cheap, and more than anything else, disgraceful.\r\nOne of the greatest flashbacks of One Piece, the one that tells the story of Noland the lier, for me, it was the greatest thing and the most interesting part of Skypea, also, the most one packed with emotions, but here, it was just, why even bother. The storytelling was just a bunch of rushed conflicted nonsense being juxtaposed, if anything, it made me appreciate the older Anime adaptation more for what it was, simple of its time, but still lives up quite strong to date, if anything, better than this ordeal.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nYou'd figure that Toei Studio would put a greater effort into high budget projects like One Piece: Episode of Sorajima, but oh boy, not this time around.\r\nFrom the looks of it, they tried desperately to adopt the pre-time skip art style into an older part of the story and guess what, the results weren't pleasant at all. Everybody from the crew looks super weird for the most time, especially Robin, I wouldn't call that Robin to be fair, some kind of imperfect clone maybe? Imagine mixing Robin and Nami together, that what we got instead, looking at her \u201ccircular\u201d face was totally uncomfortable.\r\nI was looking forward to seeing some of the big moments animated with an up to date animation, I think I shouldn't have had any high expectations, I knew the old stuff will always have a special charm to it, but this we got wasn't even close. At best, if not being skipped like Enel vs. Wiper, we got some lazy still images and that was that.\n\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nI've always enjoyed the voice acting in One Piece, now those are people doing their jobs the way they should, no slopping and no laziness. Not only that, but the majority of the old soundtracks that we rarely ever get to hear nowadays make a return, and a strong one in fact filled with nostalgia.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nI'd hate to give this any lower score because everything was rushed, caught up in an incohesive mess, no character was given enough time to \u201cshine\u201d so to speak. I've talked how the backstories didn't make any great impact, and for that, from a new comer's perspective, not a single one of them made the cut.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (5/10):\r\nNow, I a big fan of One Piece, and I'm not being biased here, to say the least. I can shove up my face any content consisting One Piece all day, that's how big of a fan I am. Yes, the special was disappointing in a big way, they cut off a lot of my favorite parts, and changed a lot of things that were perfect before, and as the people in my profession say (I am a developer); if it works don't touch it. That quote should become universal and sacred, it can rescue franchises. I had my share of laughs here, It seems the minimal remaining of humor did endure the wounds of time. Classic One Piece.\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\r\nIt all comes down to what you're expecting at the end. If you're waiting for some mind-blowing thing to happen, then don't. If you're waiting for this special to change your mind about the Skypea arc as a whole (because probably you're one of the people who didn't enjoy the arc in the first place), then it would most probably disappoint even more. But more importantly, if you're a newcomer, or a first-time watcher and still not caught up, and decided to skip the Anime arc and watch this instead as some sort of compensation, then I beg of you to not do so. This is as bad as a retelling can get, way more complicated than the Anime arc.\r\nIt was not one of the best specials of the series, it would probably rank down the chest somewhere.\n"
