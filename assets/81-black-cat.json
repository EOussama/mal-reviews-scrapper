I was told that Arthropod venom is one of the worst and most deadly venoms out there, but I guess science batted an eye on the more so deadly competitor known as nostalgia. Ever since I was little, and much like every other Arabian kid, a TV channel by the name of \u201cSpacetoon\u201d was what made all of those kids' childhood, \u201cThe channel of future youngsters\u201d was the slogan, and it was no stretch. Among the many classics they used to air was \u201cBlack Cat\u201d, with its nostalgic opening theme song and key characters, you couldn't call yourself afan if you haven't at least rewatched the series more than twice and recall the chronological order of events by heart. But over the +10 years that have passed since those simpler days, the plot, in general, had already faded from my memory and it was time to revisit the nostalgic classic once again and see if it holds up to today's standards.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nHeavily reliant on mythology and religious references, a story set on a post-war setting where conflict is still being fueled for what the losses that have already been suffered from weren't enough. A secret organization by the name of Chronos reigns from the shadows in pursuit of true peace by the means of blood and assassination, standing on the lead of its ranks numbered agents that go from 1 and increasing reaching number 13, that would be Train Heartnet, one of the protagonists of the series that seeks freedom and takes from Chronos a false escape from his intent of murder, little did he know soon enough that he will be freed with the help of Saya Minatsuki, a sweeper that helped him see the world in a different perspective.\r\nUnlike the real-world intuitive definition of a sweeper, sweepers here are people, much like freelance bounty hunters that arrest criminals alive in a manner that contradicts the methods of Chronos but also not completely oppose them. That was pretty much the set up for the story without spoiling any vital information.\r\nOne thing they nailed here is the balance of comedy and action that very few shows manage to achieve (ex; One Piece), a running theme here seems to be cat humor, so, for cat lovers out there, you're in for some minimalistic chibi cat figures, in the other hand comes the badassness, everything from the cool poses, epic entrances, badass black cloaks and guns, enough to draw in your interest in fights. However, it seems they went the wrong turn with that, most fights are just a mess of complicated poorly juxtaposed frames that barely make sense, it makes it hard to keep up and follow what's going on, for the most part, add to that the frequently low FPS moments that make my potato computer running Minecraft shaders look like a champ.\r\nOne misconception in anime is that if a show is fast-paced and straightforward, it creates opportunities for better story execution and character development, that is if done right. Black Cat suffers from consistency in pacing, it's fast yes, but faster than the flow of the story. The main quest is about revenge and redemption after all, but it doesn't leave much space for side quests to be fleshed out, and thus, every other side episode so to speak, feels like watching a horrible filler from the deepest pits of Naruto Shippuden's filler hell.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nPersonally, I adore the art style, I would describe it as that of a vampire-ish dark vibe, heavy on sharp edges but not quite as sharp as Code Geass's character's chins, God lord, those are deadly (Not to say that Code Geass is a horrible show, like seriously, if you haven't watched yet, what are you waiting for?). Having the show portrays a light-hearted comedy, it doesn't fall short on it being dark, remember, this show is about assassins, bounty hunters, a world of conflict, and if the title \u201cBlack Cat\u201d wasn't enough to emphasize, the art style surely does. The color palette is dark, but unlike other shows where it gets so dark that it's difficult to see anything on the screen, Black Cat knew when to stop. Those mix of aspects created a certain atmosphere to the story that you don't get from any other shows, I would say, it's the closest you can get to the Resident Evil 4 video game (you know what greatness you're getting now).\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nWhilst typing this, I'm still on an intense debate in my head whether I find the Arabic version of the opening theme song or the original Japanese version the better one, nostalgia is a biased factor here, but that doesn't make the other any less good. I mean, it's \u201cI can listen to this all day\u201d material going as far as \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d type of song. What I love about it is how soft and light it starts out and how quietly strong it gets near the end, makes for a perfect preparation to get you in the mood for some Train wrecking (that was intended). I'm glad they kept the same opening theme song throughout the whole run, with updated visuals midway the show, and two great ending theme songs to kind of cal you down at the end of each episode.\r\nI listened to both the English dubbed and subbed versions before choosing which one to go by, spoiler alert, it was the English sub, however, that didn't make the dubbed version look any less immersive, the main voices were spectacular, but I still wanted to go by the original version to kind of experience it the way it was made. So, for those who are deciding which one to watch, I recommend both, you might as well watch both alternating between one and other any time you see fit.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nCharacters make half the show they say, and they couldn't be wrong, I mean look at Taboo Tatoo, that's what you get when you populate a story with potential with shallow characters, absolutely terrible. Black Cat, on the other hand, did a decent job keeping things as neutral as they are.\r\nLiterally, every single character had a great development throughout, the initial Train is not the Train five episodes later, and the same Train is not the Train of later either, and that doesn't go for only main characters.\r\nThere wasn't any annoying pitiful figure that made you snap out every time they spoke, I liked every single one of them and even had my favorites as well. Buuuuuuut, an issue with lacking backstories and plausible plot holes did leave their marks, some characters were indeed fleshed out but only compared to the neglected individuals, I'm not asking for a focusing ark for every single fraction of dirt. A character needs motive and purpose, it needs to follow an ideology or else, it falls under the nouveau-rich category from the background crowd.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nNostalgia is a drug, I remember watching this show like it was like no other, it's safe to say that it was way below my expectations. Did it age well, pr-oba--b-l-y???! I'd feel guilty of admitting it, there were strong moments, but there were also weak moments that didn't live up to what I remember.\r\nI still laughed at the same exact old jokes (it seems parts of me never got old), I still liked the characters and found the story mildly interesting.\r\nAt the start of my rewatch, I went all out, a barking nostalgia dog claiming that I can binge it in no time, but the effect of the drug wore off near the two-digit episodes, and the rest was history. A humble number of episodes were just plain boring, \u201cI fell asleep while watching X\u201d material. Not my proudest come back in any respect, it seems I learned to disregard nostalgia the hard way, but the actual good parts were just enough refreshment to get me all strong and recovered.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nAs far as shounen shows, Black Cat had its unique take on the genre, nothing revolutionary, but it certainly is way different than your modern shounen shows (My Hero Academia, Black Clover...). If you want to revisit what old shows used to be like, Black Cat does a good job retaining that fashion and atmosphere, the feelings that you're sent back to 2005 for 20 minutes, that's one approach to time travel. Now, for you people who have nostalgic memories to the show, please proceed with caution, the show that blew your mind back then may never feel the same, so tone down the expectations, but don't make my words scare you, our little nostalgic friend here still has its old special charm.\n"
