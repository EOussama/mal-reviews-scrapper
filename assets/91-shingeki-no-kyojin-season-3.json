We at least got to know way more about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin than any other seasons, and thanks to this, a lot of our questions were answered, and the more episode you watched, the closer to the truth you get \u201cGotta tell this to my buddy, Erwin\u201d. Not to say fights were absent, oh no,there is a massacre on a huge scale, but the sheer exposure of world building and new information made those look very minimalistic.\r\nA lot of things finally made sense, earlier we had something like an uncut follow of past events that we needed juxtaposition for so bad in order to tie some sense to them, that's what this season was mostly about. The pacing felt a little bit slow, mainly because of the dialogue-heavy nature of the season.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nWe've gotten to the point where it's not at the least a surprise to expect high-quality animation, some fans will even use the franchise's title as a synonym for \u201cfantastic animation\u201d.\r\nWithout having to stretch this any longer, you know you're getting your doses of blood, the gloomy color pallets only make the medieval atmosphere feel more dense and alive. However, the only complaint I have, and only had about Shingeki no Kyojin is the lack of variety for unique character face design, if you really took the time, you can spot a disturbing similarity in their general facial structure; short rephrased, they look alike.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nAs good as the animation, the soundtrack is as great. This season introduced a bit of a controversial opening theme song, which a lot of people thought it was an insult to the previous ones. I for one think it's a solid song with or without the Anime, it's great, it's packed with emotion, contracts the portrayed story arc very well, I get it's not your typical loud and hype Shingeki no Kyojin opening, but it remains better than some in respect of quality.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nOut of all the other installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 was packed with character development, especially for Historia, you can even call it her season.\r\nWe've got teased about her on the earlier seasons, especially season 2, and here we got to peek under the blanket and see what was up there, and oh boy was it shocking. Eren as well got to know some truth about his lost memories, and thus had his level up to some degree in terms of character building.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nEntertainment comes in many forms, the earlier season gave us the hype with the cinematic dynamic camera freestyling over the fantastic battles, and this one had us watch out jows from hitting the ground from sheer wowing for what we get to know about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin. Enjoying your favorite characters' moments.\r\nThe midpoint of the show was a little bit meh compared to the beginning and the ending points though.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nWe've been promised of getting a full 24 episodes action-packed third season, but at some point they decided to split it in half and have the first 12 episodes focus on the political stuff, and the other half reintroduce us to raw action in \u201cprobably\u201d the most hyped season yet, but unfortunately that got delayed for some time now.\r\nFor me, season two is still the top of hype for the franchise, until we get some more shocking revelation and hyped fights that would remain as such. However, not to say that this season falls down in terms of quality of anything, we've just been spoiled way too much, having us wait 4 years for a sequel at the time had us hungry for more content, it made the good better and the bad good.\n"
