I'm sure we all know what a complex show Psycho-pass can get, from the emotion to the hype it all ties up very nicely, It's so perfect in fact that some of us might think a sequel would most definitely nor deliver the promise of the original season, most of the people are turned down very disappointed after seeing the second season, while this movie is a sequel to itself, it wouldbe worth mentioning that you can still get away watching it without having to see the second season, literally.\r\nBut the question, remains, does it deliver? let's find that out...\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nThe story takes place 3 years after the events of the second season of the show, while it's a sequel as I said before, it does not require knowing what happens during the second season, it's completely independent, and relies on more of the events of the first season.\r\nThe focus of the story shifts back yet again to Akane being involved in a large scale investigation concerning Kougami and what he's been up to all these years, the con, foundations, and conclusions really worth it, and the progression keeps you on your toes the whole time.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nSeriously, what's not to like about this? it's the exact same animation and art concept of the show, only a hundred times better, the animations, in particular, feel a lot more smooth and appealing, I mean, just notice the facial expressions, and even vocals and face muscles movements, that's some crazy insane stuff.\r\nThe anatomy couldn't' have been done better, and the CG scenes aren't as bad as I remember them in the show, truly a work of art.\r\nThe brutal scenarios do look gruesome and even more disturbing, and the fight scenes are just, ugh, spot on.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nNothing to complain about here, It's not even a month ago that I finished watching both seasons, and having heard the original soundtrack once again, filled be with constant nostalgia, but the real star of the party was the voice acting, ugh, they cast deserves a trophy on this one.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nA lot of familiar faces were brought on in this one, but there were also new people to take into consideration, Kougami, for instance, is just as cool as you remember him to be, easy going, and the typical guy that's steps ahead of his targets, and let's give some credits to our antagonist, the mercenary guy, who really gave Koygami and Akane a run on their money, big time, that was quite the challenge to take down.\r\nWhat really cuts off the cake, was seeing how Kougami reacts to Akane's growth and development, really reminds you of how far she's gotten.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nMan, it's been a while since I last saw a good movie sequel, total worth seeing for other times to come.\r\nfinishing this will only put you in the mood for a third season, which I hope would live up to the legacy of the first season, Kamui was cool, but we need some Makishima's awesomeness.\n\r\n- Overall (8.4/10):\r\nI would definitely recommend this pick, even more so than I would for the second season, no hate tho, bot ha great, but this movie, is just quality production, sets off a high ceiling for other shows to  come, if you're ready to have some great action, here's a good movie to keep your company, have fun!\n"
