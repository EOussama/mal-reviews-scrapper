So good that you want more.\r\nFor a year of waiting have I stared at this unwatched entry on my waiting list, hoping that it will drop soon so I get to enjoy more of Honda-san's daily struggles at his job, bit by bit, the anticipation turned into a daunting wait, accumulating the dying hype that it turned into a raw \u201cCan this drop already so I can get it down with?\u201d.\r\nAnd oh boy did it remind me of the reason I stayed faithful with my waiting to.\n\r\nThe classic Otaku cultured humor wecan to love is all restored in the blink of an eye, so nostalgic and heartwarming, you start wishing for a full-on season. We can only hope for one, I hope.\n"
