That, or you're just crossing another entry off your watch list. It was going to be the same for me, but, until I watched Snow Memory, my excitement was obliterated.\n\r\nA quick bit of exposition, only watch this after you've finished watching the parent first season show, and also preferably after you watch Snow Memory movie, it's not 100% required but this movie picks up directly after that one's set.\n\r\nThroughout the entire show, we keep hearing about this \u201ccontract\u201d between Puck and Emilia, and I'd be lyingif I said it did not pick my interest. Such a huge plot device will surely connect to a tangled web of deep and touching backstories that explain it all, and that's what this movie was about.\n\r\nThe movie is a direct prequel to the show, long before Subaru arrive in this world, long before Emilia settled in with Roswald and folks when she was lonely in a snow forest whose only friend was Puck.\r\nBetween you and me, I was ready for something mindblowing to be revealed, I'm the only one to blame for extra hyping this, it was all a rushed mediocre, normal-looking setup that the authors probably needed to resolve. No strings attached.\n\r\nOverall: 5.8/10\n"
