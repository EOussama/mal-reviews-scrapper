WRONG.\n\r\nThe movie picks up after the events of the first half of the parent show, so make sure you at least watched until then before checkingthis one out.\r\nThe art was decent, as there was a lack of action, I see the creative direction had more of an up than anything else.\r\nThe sound design was fine, nothing spectacular, the voice acting too, the whole cast is talented but it felt like whatever happened in this movie did not take advantage of any of that talent.\n\r\nI fell asleep twice watching this, primarily because I was tired after a long day of work, nothing to blame the movie for, however, the dead dialogue did not help any of that, in fact, it contributed to it.\n\r\nI guess this one would have been the perfect thing to watch back in the day when season 2 was not even announced, so people would get a dose of their favorite characters interacting after such a long time.\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10\n"
