    "content": "\n                I still remember last year when I decided to watch this show on a whim after postponing the Manga for many years and it was such a surprise how much entertainment the first season led to. But there was always something missing, something of substance that would make the show from a gag-fest to an engaging narrative with a firm gag facade. This was what this season did.\n\r\nWhile the first season introduced the many characters we love and like today, this season really secured the main cast as one of the best groups of main characters in modern shounen. They are blend together very well;the gags are in-verse organic. The power scaling is just as goofy and playful and the villains, well, let\u2019s say the add to the comedy lmao.\n\r\nOne surprising element this season had over the last is the fantastic animation and production quality overall, and you know the first season drew numbers when you see the astronomical jump in quality and not just the animation, but the audio department went HARD. From simply dropping the hardest opening theme song of the year to the ever-lasting whacky rap OSTs that creep by every now and then.\n\r\nThis is truly a show made for chills, either alone or with company, many laughs to be made, and one can\u2019t simply pass that off, especially these days.\n\r\nOverall: 7.7/10.\n"
