    "content": "\n                Now, that's a controversial one for me, I can't recall I've ever enjoyed watching the highly praised parent show, and I'm no snitch, I'm going to be as non-biased as I can, and give Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Moments an honest review. The general picture is, back in the quite childhood days of the protagonists, all of them happened to have been to the same exact place (for plot reasons of course), it was then where their rivalry began. We don't get to see any of their older selves, and that was much appreciated. The animation was good?! Was it always like that? Imean I always had a skeptical opinion on their creep-worthy mouths, and having them as kids not only made them exclude all of the FUPA topping and size shrinking, but also managed to erase some of their facial features, vital ones nonetheless, \u201cnoses\u201d, as if the mouth wasn't already weird enough. You know what you're getting when you give a musical anime a shot, and this one is no different I'm not huge on classical music scores, however, my ear can tell a good flow from a terrible one, and it hasn't itched of such once. For once, Arima wasn't the sole focus, however, he did retain his crucial role, [pianist1] and [pianist2] were in the spotlight showing where their motives to challenge Arima came from. You never know that kids are able to concentrate on complicated topics, but gave the middle finger to logic and had it that way. Having not seen the show in a long time, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Moments packed along so much that a crappy PHP array can hope to ever accumulate. It was a remarkably interesting take but wasn't nonetheless any less mediocre. In the end, It would be as enjoyable as you found the original anime.\n"
