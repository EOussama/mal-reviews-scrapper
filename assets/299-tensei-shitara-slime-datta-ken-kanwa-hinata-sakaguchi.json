    "content": "\n                Here's a little fun fact to you guys, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken is a 2018 Anime, time not only flies, it almost skips you before you realize it.\n\r\nIt's been a minute since season one aired, a huge community was built around the fun adventures of our Slime character and with so much happened in the first season alone, it's hard to recall everything chronologically as it happened, but fret not my dude, no need for a whole season rewatch as this 20 minutes long recap does an incredible job as going through every major plot point of the previous season and summarizes everything asit sets up to what follows in the second season.\n\r\nRecap episodes don't have the best reputation for the binge-watching type of audience, however, in rare moments like these, it saves a lot of time and engagements.\n\r\nI recommend giving this one a shot, especially if you're not a recent fan of the show, a lot of info dumped in a bit-size long episode, well-paced and refreshing at the same time.\n"
