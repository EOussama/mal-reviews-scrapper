    "content": "\n                It feels very weird to have a revolutionary arm focused recap episode as if they have done much in the story, it turned out, they did.\n\r\nSpecial episode number 15 is yet another Egghead arc recap that starts off by re-introducing Ivankov and ending by whatever befalls Sabo on Lulucia.\n\r\nI guess it\u2019s fun to have Sabo narrate the episode, someone who\u2019s not much screened in the show, and focus on the side least shown in One Piece, fun to see the story through the lens of the revolutionaries\u2019 shenanigans.\n\r\nAlthough I guess the Dressrosa portion took way too much time from the episode, but perhaps it\u2019s atelling that Sabo really saved the revolutionary arm plot.\n\r\nPlease Dragon, don\u2019t be a fraud!\n"
