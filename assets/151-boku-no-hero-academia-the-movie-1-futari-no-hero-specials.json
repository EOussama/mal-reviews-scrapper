    "content": "\n                It's really the short ones that get you straight into the feels when you least expect it, please, proceed with caution, I know I wasn't prepared for it until I felt the punch.\r\nFor starters, the photo on this MAL page doesn't contribute anything to the story carried on this short, and saying short isn't either stretching in or anything. It was literally 2 minutes long but it managed to pack up more feelings than you'd get on an episodic basis, don't you love it when they get straight into the point?\r\nI would have preferred a longer version of this hat goes deeper than the uncountableblinks you get, but I guess a canon adaptation of this is bound to happen in the main show.\r\nIn amaze me how in just two minutes you understand so much about All Might, the way he screamed that Nana was like a mother to him, the fast forward time skip after his graduation from U.A and his training with his master, that would have gotten a 5/5 had it been in an episode of the actual show.\n"
