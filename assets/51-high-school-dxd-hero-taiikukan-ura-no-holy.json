    "content": "\n                High School DxD Hero: Taiikukan-ura no Holy is an alternative conclusion of the previous season, High School DxD BorN. With this one being more canon than the other, as well as a showdown of the animation work of the new studio that's taking over the production of season 4.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nI personally liked the way this ending took root more, it made a lot more sense and used some past plot points to justify the yet ridiculous conclusion. What I liked, even more, is the minimalistic fanservice here, the lack of fanservice really helped to get the viewers to focus on what's going on, whichdid make the confrontation and Issei's transformation more emotional. But the rest still was low on effort and quality.\n\r\n- Art (6.5/10):\r\nI think that this might be the downfall in regards to the animation, the colors are more vibrant and attractive, but the art style just doesn't work with Hich School DxD, we used to have sharp edges and hard colors, but everything looks soft and out of proportions, for instance, Asia looks like she suddenly grew a cup size or something.\r\nSometimes faces look very ugly and unappealing, the really screwed the face features mapping this time.\n\r\n- Sound (6.0/10):\r\nI give this low score mainly because of the poor auditions, the voice acting felt so blunt and forced, like when Issei screams, he sounds like his voice actor was doing his last recording for the day after 20 hours of none stop work, very tired and lazy. And what doesn't stop only at Issei!\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\r\nAgain, which the poor character design,n this art style just doesn't deliver the old nostalgic vibe of the previous series. I even struggled to recognize some of the characters due to the staggering change they went through.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI know I've stated so many flaws, but I still enjoyed what I've seen for what it was, I like me some High School DxD every once and a while, and this one did deliver, even though barely.\n\r\n- Overall (6.5/10):\r\nI wouldn't highly recommend this, but it could serve as a good startup to get your a bit familiar with the nex animation and direction, and also, to make you reconsider your hype for the 4th season.\r\nAlthough, it's not that necessary, and is very skippable.\n"
