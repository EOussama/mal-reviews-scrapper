    "content": "\n                So studios would put on a generic trailer with pre-animated scenes in order to hype up an upcoming series, adding a few fan-favorite moments, slap a narrator on top maybe, throw in some spoilers for that avid Manga readers and call it a day. Heck, some will even have a 5 seconds still image with a fancy dissolve transition and be done with the whole thing, but Kaguya takes things the extra mile even when no one asks for it.\n\r\nThis is dedication right here folks. For a show that breaks the 4th wall every time you blink, this was a field trip for the screenwriters.I just love how they took liberties teasing the upcoming season as they discuss the release of the third season for some fictional character only for it to dissolve into a full-fledged, very engaging, and hilarious sitcom that could have been part of any season and still felt natural and belonging.\n"
