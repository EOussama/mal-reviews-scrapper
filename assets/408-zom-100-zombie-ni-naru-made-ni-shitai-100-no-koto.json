    "content": "\n                In vain of corporate enslavement and capitalistic exploitation, Akira Tendou, a young graduate from a prestigious university is dying inside after being defeated by his mundane daily routine that is encapsulated entirely by his job, which has been eating away his youth and passion, leaving him as motionless as a rotting zombie, with no aspirations, dreams, or drive to follow any of them. Until one day, zombie plague runs over the world, transforming his good-for-nothing life into a blockbuster movie, full of gore, excitement, and hope to live up his dreams finally.\n\r\nIt\u2019s very poetic how the modern life Akira has been living was seemingly dull,with bland colors all around, nothing of interest to look at, but as soon as zombies came in, it suddenly booms of colors, the blood and gore looked like a kindergarten painting that doesn\u2019t have a purpose other than representing the explosive drive for creativity and expression. The animation quality of the show is noteworthy. Studio BUG FILMS has done a commendable job, especially going hard on the color splatter, showing that Akira is having a brighter look on life surrounded by life-threatening zombies than he did when he was living his 9 to 5 job.\n\r\nOne thing I couldn\u2019t bat an eye on for too long is the weak character aspects. Except for Akira, who is a relatable individual, everyone else pales in comparison, to the degree where you don\u2019t care about any character exposition derailing the flow of action.\n\r\nThe show has suffered through a few production hiccups, some of which resulted in it going into a hiatus for a while, I feel like that killed off its momentum. However, it was a decent show to accompany your breakfast with.\n\r\nOverall: 7/10.\n"
