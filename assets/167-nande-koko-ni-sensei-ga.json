It seemed like you're typical harem ecchi-heavy show until you realize how massive of a following it had.\r\n\u201cNande Koko ni Sensei ga?\u201d is relatively short series that politely asked you to leave every shred of logic you'd expect and just enjoy the ride for what it is. It did not take itself too seriously, it did not bring anything new to the table either.\n\r\n- Story (5.5/10):\r\nFour teenage male students and four female teachers, one having a crush on another meet a ba- ugh, at a school, theymeet at a school. A couple of breaks later, an Anime is born.\r\nWhile not very problematic, I would drop it right off the bat and say that the show is at the very core lacks every sense of depth from what comes of a thought striking story.\r\nIt composed of a brief crossover of four related stories with interchangeable characters playing a game of odds, and it just happens to have all of them going for the protagonists. They might say love is a battlefield or some clich\u00e9 crap, but this show makes you question your life choices and making you start wondering, \u201cDid I go to the wrong school?\u201d.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nAs average as the topic it tackles, it was nothing special, very generic but just about enough to keep you watching. You better not expect any high budget over 60 fps fluid eye candy, that is, if your definition of eye-candy is something entirely different which I totally agree with, then you'll probably end up disappointed, however, to the meaty kind of eye candy I was alluding to, you bet you're going get your fill. Beautifully illustrated erotic shots make up at least 60% of the episode, which is always the selling point for this kind of shows, a welcomed feat by the way.\n\r\n- Sound (7.3/10):\r\n  As long as my eyes enjoyed the view, my ears didn't really get anything of nearly similar quality. Very basic voice acting at best, but when you come to playing roles that involve in dialogue with more moans than words, then you've got a great excuse.\r\nOn the other hand, the opening and ending songs were just amazing, I'm expecting those to appear on the next popular Anime song quiz on Youtube.\n\r\n- Character (6/10):\r\nI'm going to have to be fair in here, that's not the greatest cast of characters I've seen, and not nearly the worst either.\r\nAll pairings were very unique with respect to each other. But not nearly enough depth to them to make them that memorable, I haven't been able to memorize any names from the show, ending up forgetting about them just after I read them on every subtitle. In respect to their designs, very average which only falls on the Art department too.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI just love the concept. Starting off every episode with repeating the same words that make the title of the series \u201cNande Koko ni Sensei ga?\u201d made for hilarious moments, even though they always seemed heavily predictable. The ships were all great except for the dangerously pedophilic one (The athletic teacher and the petite boy).\n\r\n- Overall (6.68/10):\r\nI'm quite surprised with how low it scores on paper, I was preparing to drop a rating around 7 and 7.5, however, I can't recommend it highly enough if you're in for some short ecchi comedy heavy show that really pushes it as far as it can and not nitpick about every detail.\n"
