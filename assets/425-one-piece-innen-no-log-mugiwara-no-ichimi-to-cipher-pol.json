    "content": "\n                It feels like Egghead had just started and we're already having our second recap episode in the midst. However, I understand your angst, however, had you known the amount of peak we had after this episode aired, the animation and direction were immaculate that we could have done with a couple more recap episodes after.\n\r\nIt also helps that the covered material is Eniese Lobby content, an arc so loved and praised by many to be the best in Shounen, period. It was certainly a wild nostalgic lookback, everything looked so different, and not only that it felt so different too. Weirdly enough, the stakes felthigher than whatever we're dealing with now even though the enemies weren't as powerful. It really makes you proud of what the crew became after very long.\n"
