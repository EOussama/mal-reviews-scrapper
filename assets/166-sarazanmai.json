A kappa sucking off acorns with rocking music, not a lot of people are into that, but the topping on the case was never a measurement for how it tastes like.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nI find it very fascinating how fast it went from a mysterious, serious looking vibe emitter to some of the weirdest imagery you'll ever see.\r\nToi, Enta, and Kazuki, three teenagers with their respective stories get involved in a sketchy monarchy masterminded by aKappa named Keppi. They've always thought they've had it bad until the latter transformed them into Kappas with grace in a style that can keep a straight face while fighting a serious fight as they fabulously pose every 10 seconds or so.\r\nWhat I described on the few lines above or at least tried to, is the very abstract description that one can get up rolling in their heads upon watching the first couple of episodes or so. But really, it pulls up its own pace and reveals on the greater story bit by bit.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nWild, crisp, mystic, I really can't phrase it in an audible term. It has a cartoonish feel to it, but still feel very Anime, art-style in mind of course.\r\nFor a mortifying concept, you'd really miss anticipating the production value it's going have, but not until you see it, the animation has so many frames than an Indie game running on the latest hardware, and that's no stretching it, it really helps sell out the abstract formulas on the screen.\n\r\n- Sound (8.8/10):\r\nIt honestly hit the note just in the right place you keep you satisfied, for a show that has a lot of vocal performances in it, everything from openings and endings, to the soundtrack to miscellaneous songs was one of the best this season, the voice acting was also on part with all the high-quality content from the get-go.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nI wouldn't say it was revolutionary when it came to presenting a character that you can relate to, it simply did it with the most efficient way possible, even after hitting you with the Kappa thing, you still cried for them, laughed with them and cheered for every one of them.\r\nFor a story that went along the trio strengthening their bond, you could see the character development they carried, which showed that all the Shirikodama (Don't Google this) thingy wasn't for nothing.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.8/10):\r\nI was not ready, on so many levels to step into this, I was only interested in watching the series after I saw the infamous butt sucking scene from one of Gigguk's videos, and then it gave me a story I never expected to receive in a similar show, which made me glad I took interest in this series in the first place.\n\r\n- Overall (8.42/10):\r\nJust watch it, it's really easy to sleep on this show, very underrated and looked down upon, but seriously, just give it a try. Don't get scared by the ridiculousness that is Kappas put you off, because as much of a relationship it has with the show it's not all the show is concerned about, it has much more to offer and sleeping on it will be such a loss.\n"
