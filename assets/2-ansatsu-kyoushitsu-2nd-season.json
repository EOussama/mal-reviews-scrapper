    "content": "\n                When I first started watching season 1, I totally went blindfolded in, 0 expectations, while in season 1, I got to get attached to the characters, get to know each and every person in the show, this season extended that even further, and executed a splendid unfortunate ending to the show. This last episode was very nice, seeing everyone grow up and following their dreams, it's just as Koro-sensei wanted. I was hoping they could save him somehow, but whatever now, I'm not going to complain as this outcome was just fine.\n\r\n-Art (9/10)\r\nNothing unusual from the first season, The characters are well designed, the backgroundswere blending amazingly with the atmosphere, Nothing here to complain about.\n\r\n-Story (9/10)\r\nMid-schoolers are assigned to a mission to save the world, simply killing their teacher before the next march, the students grew attached to their teacher with time, as they were always consulting him asking for help and advice more than they practiced assassinating him. The plot progression was really good, nothing too rash or cheesy (not most of the time at least).\n\r\n-Characters (9/10)\r\nLots of unique characters, where we see an even greater character development from that of season 1, Seriously, the initial class E is no more, everybody got an enhancement in their characteristics and treats,\n\r\n-Music (7/10)\r\nNothing remarkable here, just like season 1, the music fits the atmosphere, the openings and ending tho were beautiful, all of them, the sort of songs that you hate at the Begining, but grow loving them later.\n\r\n-Enjoyment (9/10)\r\nI started this series as a silly show based on somewhat a joke, but I discovered what was shadowed beneath the continuous humor later on. I loved every single reference, especially One Piece's, the humor was great, and the feels were as hard as someone using Bosushoku Haki ;),\n\r\n-Overall (8.6/10)\r\nI'll never regret watching this, I had it on my list for months now, and I've been avoiding it on purpose fearing that it might disappoint, but have I been deceived into jumping to conclusions, I absolutely adored this show, it had many influences, and definitely would recommend it to people.\n"
