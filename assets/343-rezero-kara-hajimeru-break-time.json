Turned out, for the first time, I had fun.\n\r\nVery easy to run through, episodes are a minute long, the jokes aren't half bad, not hilarious, but passable. The art is cheap, but compared to the norm, it feels alive.\n\r\nThe dialogue seems to cover the first 11 or 12 episodes from the show, so no spoilers for the ending in sight, that's good, make sure you've at least already seen up until half of the show.\n              "
