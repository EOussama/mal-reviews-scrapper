That's exactly what this third season was for the entire series.\r\nI've uttered the expression \u201cThat's it?\u201d at the end of some of the seasons, but this one tries up the loose ends so well that when it wraps up and leaves nothing else to be desired. Of course, more season would be fantastic, but for what the first season set out to be, you can'task for a better conclusion of Kuroko's coming of age Basketball themed story.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nIn the previous season, the plotline always felt like it was focusing on every other side character of Generation of Miracle member while always having a blurred out focus on Kuroko despite him being the title of the series. I mean, he does seamlessly live up to be the phantom sixth even when his name is the first thing you see, but not anymore.\r\nA proper highlight has been given to Kuroko at last, to the point where it literally made him stand out more and somewhat give up on his lack of presence. We finally got to see the past of the Generation of Miracles in a canon context, how they started, and how they parted and what Kuroko was to his old team. At the end of the day, as the previous seasons gave resolution to different members of the Generation of Miracles, this one really went all out to flesh out both Kuroko and Akashi out.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nThe art and animation in this series only get better and better and sees no way of stopping. Even stills look very crisp and standout over the backgrounds that are, by the way, despite relying on CGI, they seem to blend in very well with the rest of the animation.\r\nThe highlights especially are absolute eye candy, it's not even fair anymore.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nAgain with the party banging openings and endings, I swear this show knows nothing but consistency, something a lot of similar shows never heard about.\r\nIt was in this season that I have started admiring the voice acting and talent shown, maybe it was the intensity of the finals and semi-finals what brought the real talent of the cast, screaming at the opponent at the top of your lungs while processing to give an emotional boost never ceases to get old if done this well.\n\r\n- Characters (8.6/10):\r\nWell, if anything, this was the season that really took the characters seriously. 90% of the complaints previously was how Kuroko and was never the center of focus, he never shows any growth, he's just there from season one episode one. But that's no more. And in contrast, Akashi's development really tells so much on the old and the new Generation of Miracles and how things escalated to the ways they are in the present timeline.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.3/10):\r\nIt seems I was afraid of nothing. After the meh season one and the amazing season two, I was in doubt of season three that it could fall off the grid, but I'm glad it didn't. The show follows the same sought intense Basketball games that, yeah, they do tend to drag out for 6 or more episodes, but in each and everyone big moment and highlights for the entire cast of characters, even for the ones sitting on the bench.\n\r\n- Overall (8.48/10):\r\nThis season solidifies the entire series as a solid and good standing show that tells a classic tale of growing up and never giving up. Friendship is a big theme also, and how severing your bonds can only lead to sadness and emptiness.\n"
