That was probably the biggest aspect that made the original FLCL the loved piece of work that we've come to know. Although called a sequel, \u201cFLCL Progressive\u201d is a yet blunt and abstract on the surface piece of art made by kindergarten children that you'd expect from the hipsters of the era who have no sense of fashion (ironic) to call a revolutionarymasterpiece, although it has nothing to do with the original OVA, and focuses entirely on its own made up story, with new characters, new direction, and a new premise. The majority of the fans preferred FLCL to remain the lone wolf it always was, probably that what made it unique. Many hardcore fans fared the arrival of this period, but what happened had already happened, and all that's left for them to do is let out a gloomy sigh and give this unwanted stranger a chance, maybe, just maybe it turns out to be the sequel we all didn't want, but never knew we needed. However, does it do the series any favor by existing? \n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nMuch like the original, on the surface, not a single faint sense of story can be picked up, at least not that easily. They for some reason decided to skip the introduction of the town the events take place at, from the context of it all, it was probably set at the same place as the original, I don't know if it was intended from the viewers to get it themselves, either way, is it an up or a down is debatable. Unlike the original where we had a huge focus on Takkun the whole time, while the remaining time we get to see about other minor characters, this sequel decided that it was a bad way to do things and thus presented 2 potential main characters. On one side you have a girl, 14 years old Hidomi Hibajiri, the typical depressed teenager that does in her daily routine nothing outside of waking up and going to school, sometimes working part-timely in her family coffee shop run by her mother, very boring life. On the other hand, there's Ko Ide, a go-lucky dude looking like a main-side-character hybrid in attire. Both immatures get caught up in some serialization of events caused by the familiar Haruko Haruhara and the new figure from the same race, Julia Jinyu.\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, both teens are cursed by the fate of having inter-galactic robots coming out of their foreheads, not only that but many other characters as well, which makes it less special of an ability than we are familiar with.\r\nThe humor was just a NO, predictable jokes with pretty much dead humor. The pace wasn't as fast as the original, and you'd think it would be a good thing, but the original still managed to do things better than this sequels despite the speed gap.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nFLCL has always proven itself to be outside of the visual borders of the traditional Anime, so whacky at times and yet so creative, very diverse and alive, the alteration of the colors and camera angles to even completely flip a switch on the art style portrayed. However, seeing a 2018 production pale in comparison with a production from 2000 is just utter nonsense, absolutely unforgivable and disappointing. Not to say that overall the quality was horrible, but the fact that it was unfaithful to what made the original so big is such a turnoff.\r\nYou could really sense their desperation to recreate FLCL but in a more modern art style standards, turned out to be non-fitting at all, like reliving the nightmares of the new Teen Titans and Power Puff Girls shows, and we all know how that ended, makes you wonder if they learned any lesson from that. They even went as far as trying to adopt the same animation concept but in a different direction, like remember the classic fast-paced manga panel scene from the first episode of the original? I think I just witnessed an act of murder in its case. Also, the very low FPS rate on some of the most important battles that were supposed to be fluid and dynamic was completely unsatisfying, feeling like staring at a footage of a painted wall drying at 8 FPS. All that was left is the nostalgic vibes of the aesthetic scenarios from the original, there was nothing of that sort in this. I would at best get 3 or 4 wallpaper material screenshots from the entire 6 episodes while compared to the two number digits I can get from a single episode of the original.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nMusic played a huge role in making the original series as memorable as it was, big thanks to the Pillows for that. And fortunately enough, we got them back in this sequel too with some of the reused tracks from the original that added a sense of nostalgia to the show, that was very appreciated. I remember watching the subbed version on my first experience, and it was phenomenal, I never got near the dubbed territory and I never enjoyed it in FLCL at least (I still prefer some dubs over subs though), but one issue I had with this is the non-existence of a subbed version, yes that's right, being an Adult Swim original it came only dubbed and we may never live to see a subbed version in the works. For all that matter, I really hated it, for the most part, especially Haruko's performance, it was super cringy, uncomfortable and hard to take in context. I was okay with other voice actors though, Julia's, Ko's and Hidomi's were superb at what they did. The soundtracks were above average and so were the sound effects used making you feel home but not to the degree of the original.\n\r\n- Character (4.0/10):\r\nIt would seem that FLCL Progressive would be this revolutionary step up from the original seeing how it had a huge ego just because it decided to come up with the original idea of having more than one main character, but it ended up barking with more than it could deliver upon. While Hidomi was on some level, a solid FLCL protagonist material, looking like the main character for a change, and having a motive about her depression, Ko, on the other hand, was just there to fill up a spot that we expected way more from. Looking at his design, he doesn't look like the main character, probably just a bit that you are guaranteed to mistake him for a non-protagonist if you were to put him among background crowd. I understand that design doesn't define a good character, and with this, we move to their reasoning about choosing him to be a main despite all of that. Throughout the 6 episodes, we never got anything backing this guy out, I guess he exists solely for the purpose of being a trigger for Hidomi to act heroically.\r\nNow to the most controversial part, Haruko Haruhara, this was what set me off. It was like introducing a completely near-perfect replica of her, having the same voice and wearing the same skin, but it was still surrounded by an aura screaming this is a stranger. Yes, she had always been unpredictable, random, as abstract as a classic painting by Picasso, but it seems as if the creators forgot how to reproduce what they once perfected.\r\nBehind all of this mess was a shiny gem of a character, Julia Jinyu, an extraterrestrial related to Haruko that takes the side of the main characters acting like a mix between Canti and Haruko. Very lively and vibrant design refreshing to the eye, totally something worthy of the original. The rest of the cast resides in Hidomi's mother, very one-dimensional character that didn't offer much, and some classmates of the main duo, which by the way acted like a complete waste of potential.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nI was very skeptical at the very beginning about watching this, but no matter how long I avoided it I knew I would someday watch it. It was all in means of experiencing something new about FLCL but I was never more wrong. In terms of FLCL vibes, there were none. I remember it to be a show with a special layer of depth that made it look very depressing and gloomy, kind of the GTA IV is on consoles, covered in a blue filter that makes New York feel like the opposite of what you'd call liberty city.\r\nI enjoyed some characters, for instance, I rooted for Hidomi and Ko all the way, there was this fat guy who was desperate about getting this loli girlfriend, and it was a sight worth seeing. I don't know if the one chuckle I cracked during watching this is worthy of making the show humorous, but a diamond under countless trash doesn't make the garbage a diamond mine.\n\r\n- Overall (6.0/10):\r\nFor those people who really want to re-experience FLCL anew, I highly recommend rewatching the original instead of diving into this strange territory of disappointment, that is, if you were expecting this to offer the same things. With that said, if you're open-minded, and watch to see something new that's not entirely FLCL-ish, you might get something out of this. Although it's not going to be of the same depth mind you.\r\nAnd for those people who for some reason want to skip the original FLCL and watch this as a means of guidance into the universe of FLCL than just don't, this installment is the wrong place to start, as it can be described as everything but FLCL.\n"
