A moment of silence for those brethren that were big on the franchise, but didn't live long enough to witness its return.\n\r\n- Story (8.6/10):\r\nThe third season was long, it was different, and very complex when it started, and very little was clear up by the time it ended, leaving us ona massive blood rushing cliffhanger, something making me question why this one was a standalone release, it can easily stand out as episodes 9, 10, and 11, and seeing how each episode is a massive 40 minutes screening, it can allude to a total of 22 normal episodes, taking after the first season.\n\r\nThese 3 episodes or 2 hours movie (depending on how you saw it) do clear up all of most of the confusion left from the third season, it focuses on the infiltration of the Nona tower, an intense fast-paced tactical epic that had everyone we knew on the tip of their toes running against the clock.\n\r\nThe plot really shows that there is more to the Sybil system than we thought we knew, it expanded the lore more and dropped gazes at possible plot points that can be exploited for more stories to come.\n\r\nThe movie ends up on a peaceful open-ended note, a satisfying conclusion to everything from season 2, and that's a lot seeing how many releases we got, it tied up a lot of loose ends for once and for all, but also set up to a possible continuation that we hopefully get shortly.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nFantastic, this series is one of the rare ones that get the treatment it deserves and more. Everything falls in at a normal perspective, aside from the minimal CGI that slips, everything is blent just perfectly.\r\nThe fight scenes are given the proper time and effort, some of them even look like they've been rotoscoped. Definitely a product of a massive budget and a talented team of animators.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nI was mesmerized, even more than the prequel third season.\r\nI would have been super fine if they reused the same opening song from the previous season, but man, I was both surprised and amazed at how good the new one is, I mean, I enjoyed all of the OPs that came from this project, but I never put anyone close to the first OP, but now, they are on equal footing if it weren't for the nostalgia that surrounds the first one. \u201cSynthetic Sympathy\u201d by \u201cwyxt.\u201d, google it, it's mesmerizing. Probably the only opening that comes close to the vibes of the first season.\n\r\nThe ending theme song had some great emotions as well, very calming, and also saddening.\n\r\nThe voice acting was superb as always, the Seiyuus clearly love and enjoy what they are doing, every character feels like a genuine living being if its role. Ginoza and Kougami, of course, are present, and so is their charming voice, Arata too had some great performances especially at his big moment in the end.\n\r\n- Character (8.2/10):\r\nPlot-wise, Kei and Arata, no, their whole unite was the star of the third season and this one, but deep inside, we all know the OG team from season 1 was and is always the protagonist, their presence was very hard felt during both entries. It's very well directed too seeing how they didn't halt or overtake the progress of the new team, we do see them involved yes, but Arata and Kei did also have their shining moments, they contributed to the plot and gained somewhat of a following from the fans.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nThe third season while good, always felt like it lacked something import, the secret ingredient that makes Psycho-Pass what it was, we all thought, and for the longest time it was Kougami and folks, but hey, we did have them, even for a brief time before, but now, this violent action-driven arc made it clear, it was always the lore and the focus on the Sybil system, pulling on the threads and seeing the conflict rise up. It really gave literally everyone presents an opportunity to do something, even Shinon had a great moment with her character arc after so long. Definitely a promising comeback for the series.\n\r\n- Overall (8.76/10):\r\nIf you have already made it through the third season, I don't see what's stopping you, this is a canon continuation and it clears up all the foggy mess that the previous season left unclear, if fact, I would encourage people to watch the third season just so they can experience this greatness.\n"
