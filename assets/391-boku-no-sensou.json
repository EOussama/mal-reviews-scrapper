So when Shinsei Kammattechan's \"Boku no Sensou\" was announced as the opening theme for \"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season\", fans were beyond excited to hear what this song had in store for us. But unfortunately, it seems that this full version of the song fell flat, failing to live up to the hype that had surrounded it.\n\r\nIt's a common misconception that more is always better. But when it comes to music, it's all about how the pieces fit together. And inthe case of \"Boku no Sensou\", the longer version just doesn't seem to work. The buildup is slow and lacks any real impact, and the chorus just doesn't hit as hard as it should. It's almost as if the song was meant to be just a minute-long snippet to get fans pumped up, but then they decided to expand it into a full-length song. And what was once an explosive intro, now feels like a damp squib.\n\r\nIn a way, it's a shame that \"Boku no Sensou\" turned out this way, because the visuals for the music video were pretty imaginative. But when the visuals are the best part of the song, it just goes to show how much the song itself is lacking. It's a rare occurrence when the full version of an Anime song is worse than the cropped version, but unfortunately that's the case with \"Boku no Sensou\". The song just feels like it's missing something that could have taken it from average to amazing.\n"
