It slowly starts luring the viewer's mind until it drops a bomb of astonishment on them, now, I've watched a tremendous amount of fiction, and I never ever had the chance to see something as cool as a person awakening into somebody else's body executing this well. that was me trying to summarise the initiative plot without having to reveal too much if you're the sci-fi guy, that might have teased you a bit int checking this one up.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nI'm going to come straight and say it, the art looks kind of weird, but, hey, weird in an interesting way?! perhaps it was just my first experience with the type of art that led me to set a score this average for this pick, but it's worth noting that it's not by any means bad, it's something you can get used to, not the realistic way, of course, the artists went for a kind of artistic approach, the way they modeled the character's anatomy, the sluggish movements, and all, but I got to admit, they nailed the CG part, freaking killed it, man!\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nI might be the one to say this, the audio part is not the strongest aspect of this animation, the voice acting was great and all, but aside from that, everything was just, you know, meh-like, I have no complaint of course, but at the same time, it's nothing that caught my ears that much.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nFor such a short story, and a very narrow veriety of characters, it does take a delicious peice of story out of the remains, I don't have any problems without characters, usually you'd have a braty or very immature protagonists, but in this one, you really feel the realistic side of them, you feel the lived sould inside of them, there is a fear of death and defeat, the relashionships between the personnels are also interesting, I never seen a more awkward sibling since the last time I watched \u201cNo game no life\u201d, and this pair really nailed it.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10)\r\nI've watched a lot of amazing shows lately, and that left me with a great fear of ever starting a new show, and then realizing it never stood up to my top X picks, but I've come to understand that what makes a masterpiece into one, is the fact that it stands up, and the fact that it's rare and hard to match, now I did enjoy this movie, in fact, it only made me watch to ask for more, now, if this were to be made into an official series, I'd blindely dive in, the world seemes very interesting to explore, and the lore is just too crazy that I started to get some \u201cNo game no life\u201d flash backs trying to relate the two with one another, you gte introduced to a lot of consepts and terms like \u201cThe U.S military standard tactical mobile anti-personnel machines, Wardogs\u201d, yes, that's how serious and complicated it gets.\r\nthis was just an amazing half an hour, if only there were some more well-composed stories out there.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nI'm really left disappointed about the fact that this is a standalone animation, with no confirmed sequels or anything to fill the whole of confusion that was left into me after finishing watching this show, would I recommend it? definitely, a quick refresher of how amazing sci-fi anime shows can get, just get some popcorn, and before you know it, the 24 minutes long,g movie would be long gone, the popcorn bowl would have been long stolen away by a sibling of yours while you were left questioning your life after being so invested into a story that could have been much greater if there was a completion to it.\n"
