    "content": "\n                Not everyone enjoys themselves a recap, especially on short series such as this one but recaps are not just a reminder, well, most of the time they are. But not always.\r\nIn some few shows, especially the short ones, the massive character rooster can be pretty overwhelming and hard to keep up with, a lot of new names all at ones can ruin great moments and distract you from important conversations, but 91 Days Recap at least nails explicitly at its core with this one.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nAs simple as it can get, a young kid survives the massacre of his own family and devotes his lifeto get the revenge. Making a come back after 7 years and penetrating the family responsible undercovered as one of their members, and it gets much more complex as it goes on.\r\nThe pacing here couldn't really be any good more than it already is, not too rushed or too slow.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nAs simple as it looks, the animation has some quality to it here. The art style looks very generic but not funky or bad, every move is fluid and complementary to the fast-paced music as well.\r\nI like the approach they took with presenting faces and expressions, you don't see any characters having their eyes taking half the space on their face. The art style looks a lot realistic than what you get nowadays, seeing how this is a modern series.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI absolutely love the opening and end theme songs, let's not forget the soundtracks. One other thing that made me glad to have chosen the DUB version was the accurate translation and accent imitation. All the voices matched their portrayed faces and attitudes perfectly.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nI have no problem with the characters, of course, I dislike some but for a reason is that you as the viewer are supposed to not like them, something that I think this show does perfectly.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI'm not much of a recap fanboy, but I like me some good ones, and this one didn't disappoint. It's just a retelling of the first 7 episodes focusing on highlights that have come to pass, just what I needed with this type of shows.\n\r\n- Overall (7.9/10):\r\nI wouldn't actually recommend this if you're not too invested in the show, but it's always fun to pick up old stuff that you didn't notice at the start or just to refresh your memory on the big bangs that have happened. Anyways, this was a solid recap in my eyes.\n"
