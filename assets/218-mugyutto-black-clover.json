    "content": "\n                Squishy is everything these shorts were. Before being released, I was eagre, just like every other mini spin-off series to see what it could hold off to; the same deal I did with the Attack on Titan shorts back in the day. The art style screams of comedy packaged into a wholesome and lightweight delivery, clinging to what Black Clover offers from oneliners to self-aware, self-centered jokes that the fans always say about the series; Asta's driven megaphone screaming, Yuno's limited dialog, and Noelle's obsession of asserting her royalty.\r\nThe shorts fall under a surprisingly serializing plot that carries on episode after the other, with Sally,or Shadow-cloaked Sally playing the villain, fueling conflict between the Demon skull and The Black Bulls. Did I forget to mention Cyborgs? Yes, there is even a classic Sentai Mecha theme going on, one I never asked for, but even satisfied part of my fantasies created from that one Docking scene from One Piece.\n"
