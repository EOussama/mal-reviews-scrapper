The video serves as the first ending song for the series and it truly captures the essence of the series in an artistic and creative way.\n\r\nThe video starts with a shot of Bojji and Kage in their childhood, depicting their initial encounter and the start of their friendship. As the song progresses, we see them grow and evolve as they go through different adventures and challenges together. The animation style is cartoony and childish, fitting perfectly with the spirit of Bojji and Kage's friendship.The childish art style helps to emphasize the innocence and pure bond of friendship between the two characters.\n\r\nThe video also features scenes from the series, including the iconic moments between Bojji and Kage as they help each other through their journey. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the colors are vibrant and eye-catching. The video is also well-edited and the cuts are seamless, making it easy to follow the story.\n\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of the video is the way it showcases the bond between Bojji and Kage, and how their friendship is the backbone of the series. The lyrics of the song, \"Oz.\" by Yama, also adds to the emotional impact, with lines like \"Even though we're small, we can still shine,\" and \"Together, we're unstoppable.\" The song and the video work together to deliver a powerful message of friendship, positivity, and courage.\n"
