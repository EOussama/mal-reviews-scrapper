Back when TV was the main media consumption device. That golden era of the early 2000s.\n\r\nI feel like the perfect representation of that weird liminal nostalgia in Anime is the original FLCL, it was so mystical, so relatable, and weirdly bittersweet, and then some spin-offs were announced but the facade of nostalgia dulled out and all hype prior to its release was met with nothingbut disappointment. But this time felt different, this time it\u2019s not a pretentious spin-off, it\u2019s a full-on reboot, or maybe I\u2019m snorting under-treated copium over here.\n\r\nYou thought 3D was bad? I think you just haven\u2019t seen FLCL: Grunge then, this was a master\u2019s piece, a perfect blend between 2D and 3D that was fully 3D but sold the 2D vibes better than most 2D animations. It was super animated and super-expressive; it felt larger than life.\n\r\nI love retrospective narrative direction, which is probably why I fell in love with the words of the likes of Tarantino, this reboot was composed of such, three episode telling the same events, only through the scope of three different characters, each perspective adds in tons of layers on the plot with so many convoluted sub plots mixed in that makes you beg to rewatch another time.\n\r\nOne of the most common criticisms around the spin-offs before was that they ruined Haruko\u2019s character, they either made her way too over the top and thus appeared very try hard and forced, or they dulled it up below the notch, however, this one is as crazy and unpredictable as the original, it kind of gives it a run of her money.\n\r\nThe Pillows return, I think that\u2019s it, that\u2019s the real selling point, or at least it is for me. The whips of nostalgia as the first notes kick in and you come to realize it\u2019s The Pillows is very chilling, very sad in a way, but also very happy, as if you\u2019re meeting an old friend after many years of separation.\n\r\nI feel like this reboot is an anomaly, it defined the stereotype, it beat the odds, and most of all, it pays respect to the original work.\n\r\nOverall: 8.48/10.\n"
