    "content": "\n                I have fond memories of Goblin Slayer the first season. As I have been a long-time Anime fan, I have only started to keep up with seasonal releases as recently as fall 2018 (as of writing this), and Goblin Slayer was one of those shows where I first tasted the seasonal waters. It was shocking, especially at the time, with iconic OST and tragic characters. But then time went on, new Anime came and went and the landscape has changed drastically ever since until the sequel dropped.\n\r\nDiving into the world of Goblin Slayer after such a long time felt very weird and unnatural for me,these characters I thought I knew a long time ago are mere strangers now, they have grown it seems, but in reality, it was me who grew. My taste has changed and matured, I thought I was gonna be through the show, but it showed me that the story has also gone a more mature path than it left out on previously.\n\r\nIt seems like the sequel kept up the momentum of the prequel from what I can remember. The peaceful life-of-life sequences are still here, but also the dark and convoluted undertones that fill in the rest of the space.\n\r\nVisually, the series steps up its game. I\u2019m not gonna say it was as great as the definition of great in modern-day industry, but at least compared to the prequel, it was marginally better. I gotta give props to the cinematography here, those camera angles in action scenes were where half of the hype was.\n\r\nThe sound design in Goblin Slayer is another aspect where the series shines. I can never get enough of the desperate screams and howls that the show gets a lot off of. Goblins are in a way a very low-level thread, even in the world of Goblin Slayer, however, other than their overwhelming numbers, the fact that they can make characters scream so shakingly gives them much more aura.\n\r\nAnd of course, don\u2019t get me started on the OST. The opening and ending yet again delivered as certified bangers. We are in good hands.\n\r\nI guess my second coming into the series was not half bad, even after this long of a wait, but it seems like this season was never gonna reach the heights of season one, but then again, the prequel capitalized of the factor of shock brilliantly.\n\r\nOverall: 7.48/10.\n"
