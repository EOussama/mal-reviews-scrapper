    "content": "\n                It feels like OVA-wise, a lot of people fall short into diving in the hype unless it's about that popular series which Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken definitely is. It was aired along with the parent show and yet got its own entry on Anime tracking websites, it seems, I just have to write down some paragraphs so I can sleep with relief tonight.\n\r\nAll-in-all, let's just say it was a recap, but an interesting one indeed, still somewhat boring to follow on a primitive look though.\r\nVeldora accompanied with Ifrit are having a friendly Shogi game while they are narrative over what has happened since episode1 forward. Aside from Veldora's and Ifrit's meeting moment, there was no new visual content to appreciate, all you get are snapshots from different episodes of the series that emphasizes the progression of the plot as they spat their insight on everything that happened.\n\r\nWe do get some new information regarding Veldora's background, a few hits for what might come afterward, but that's about it. It really felt cheap and kind of daunting to sit through, they could have done a much better job at this.\n"
