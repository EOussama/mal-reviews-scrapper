Fast forward to 2020, we finally got an official confirmation, so regarding that, see you guys in 2021, on board of the hype train.\r\nWith that aside, let's talk about this entry.\n\r\nBleach KaraBuri!: Gotei Juusan Yatai Daisakusen! is the 2008 jump fest feature that baits you into the series with the wide selection of characters, each introducing themselves in a humorous way, cracking jokes and breaking the fourth wall. As a chronological order, it's notnecessarily suitable to put into a chronological place, it's the closest thing you can get to an Ad.\r\nAnimation did not age well, the voice acting was... all over the place, a lot of shouting and misplaced dialogue, like walking into a room where every Ad ever is being recorded out loud at the same time.\n"
