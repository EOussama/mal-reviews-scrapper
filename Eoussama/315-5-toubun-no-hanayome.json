It's then that you realize that show is special, but for it to do it not once, but twice? Now that's an impactful piece of media.\r\nWhen I first watch the first season more than a year ago, I thought it couldn't get any more empty inside, fast forward now, after finishing the second season, I don't think I'm gonna survive this one.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nI'm not grading a critical marvel here, it's no Attack on Titan, after all, it's a harem show, so the story meanssomething entirely different in this context.\r\nThis one embodies what every sequel should thrive to be, it introduces so much and improves on what was introduced earlier. Is this the best harem or what? For what i's worth, it nails down every bullet point in the handbook and innovates at the same time. The pacing is great, so much can happen in the first half of the episode alone, feeling you so much content and quickly that your heart starts racing, rivaling that of the characters involved.\r\nThis season waste no time expanding on the backstories that were hinted n the first season and tie them back to the present events perfectly whilst also managing to squeeze more questions about who is who and what is what. \n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nDefinitely, an improvement over the first season, although at the beginning, it had some questionable changes like Futaro's eye color change and some of the color grading, overall, it looks nicer and more modern.\r\nAlthough the same as the first season, the character design was the best in this one, it captured the cuteness of each of the girls perfectly making us wishing for more.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nThe opening song from the first season is iconic at this point, I don't know how they did it but they came up with an equally wholesome and catchy one for this sequel too, almost felt like an unreleased vers of the first opening theme song.\r\nThe voice acting in this one was beyond amazing, remember season one, only better. I don't know what but I swear everyone sounds cuter and more tender than ever. Not only the dialogue was carried out perfectly but also the sentence interruptions and ambient sound they make with their mouths, it felt genuine and involving.\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\r\nThere, I typed it, 10/10 everybody, I had already decided on this one when I was only 4 episodes in, let me elaborate.\r\nUesugi just has to be my favorite harem protagonist, he's not dense, and he's not a shameless horny teenager either. He acts with logic and consideration to all of the girls and thinks twice before speaking, I just love that. He doesn't feel like a dummy being manipulated by the plot, but more like vice versa.\r\nThe of the girls have grown so much between the two seasons. A character development like which I never saw, and I'm talking literally here, I don't spite big statement like this on a whim before rethinking it over dozens of times. I swear to God, all the girls feel different from what they started, especially Nino who magically went from my most hated to nearly converting to her ship, and even Yotsuba, how can my heart falter from the Miku ship that I have been a member of since day 1? And Ichika's subtle drastic development that nearly flipped the entire series on its head? And Itsuki's schemes that keep all others on their toes, it's like the first season was advocating to \u201cWhy can't we all have him equally\u201d while this season was more like \u201cI want him to myself\u201d.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nI swear not a single episode, not a single moment, not a single second was eye-rolling or dull, I would start an episode and before I know it, the ending song is already playing, episode by episode, it's been a long time since I last binged a season in one sitting, and this speaks a lot about how good this show is. By far, my favorite harem and might as well be my favorite romance so much so that I'm already planning a rewatch.\n\r\nOverall (9.3/10):\r\nI truly believe that this show can get even non-harem fans into the genre. It doesn't rely on cheap Ecchi scenes to sell out its premise, it's all wholesome games and conversations that play into the great scheme of things making it in my opinion the perfect waifu warzone for those who like this type of stuff. In my opinion, as far as modern harems go, The Quintessential Quintuplets is a much watch.\n"
