Zankyou no Terror (or Terror in Resonance) takes place on a modern Japan, a place still haunted by the post-war and political conflicts more shock than a handkerchief on a windy evening. And as the title might suggest, it discusses elements of a serious phenomenal the world has come to be pretty common with lately. Terrorism, and youthful rebellion. But can terrorism ever be justified?\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nSeveral mysterious terrorist attacks take Japan bystorm in consecutive order led by two individual 17 years old guys, respectively called Nine and Twelve under the cover-names of Sphinx 1 and Sphinx two. The two adolescents go through challenging the local police by planting random locations with explosives and giving the cops a deadline to race time with, solving riddles and disarming the bombs in time. That is after they get this troubled girl involved with them, meet Lisa, a clumsy high schooler depressed from her life wanting a way out of her boring routine.\r\nThese genius teenagers, of course, having a greater goal to achieve that made them start these terrorist attacks in the first place, but luckily, the police on this show are not dumb, and manage to corner them at times.\r\nThe speed of the story progression is great and gives focus on the backstories and character development, balancing between intense action and devastating emotional moments, it makes you see how much of a change can a mere three inexperienced kids against the whole world achieve.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nWelcome to the how to produce a good animation 101 course, the first lesson would be, AVOID USING HORRIBLE CGI, NO, AVOID USING CGI ANIMATIONS AT ALL COST. I went harsh on the caps on that one, for that, I apologize, but seriously tho, especially on modern Anime, while there are great CGI shows, the rest 95% are just absolute trash (Getting some painful 3D Berserk flashbacks), most of the issues come due to mixing 2D and 3D animation methods, a simple slip up can screw up a whole scene (Inuyashiki had great transitions though, well, most of the time that is).\r\nI really appreciate the direction the animation department went on with this one, I don't recall seeing any use of extreme CGI in the whole 11 episode span of animation, at least, none that I could notice, which is absolutely great. Being a show about terrorism, explosions would take a big part of it, and I'd have to say, those were some amazing explosion sequences, the debris and shockwaves, the blast and the change to warmer color tint after each blast was flawless. Moving to the character designs, those were some real characters in both anatomy and general facial expressions, and don't even get me started on how beautiful the digitally painted background looked.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nThe voice actors starring in this pick were promising and good at what they've presented, the likes of Kaito Ishikawa (Ida from Boku no hero Academia, and Genos from One Punch Man to name a few of his roles), and with serious toned shows like Zankyou no Terror they didn't slack one bit to deliver what you'd expect from terrified, put in danger people, the hesitation in their voice, their cries and their screams all had a real weight to it.\r\nThe soundtracks were strong on this one with smooth transitions between the intense and emotional blood thrilling tracks.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were gorgeous, and their resonance was that of its kind. I like how the opening song is a bit soft, feeling fragile and sad for what topic the show discusses, the same fall under the ending theme song as well.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nMost shows would just either have poor characters that don't fill up one's stomach or be filled with characters that can never serve a purpose for how short the series can be. Zankyou no Terror introduces a small but rich character cast that all of them get their moments of shine and development. There is the genius type that always makes the right decisions and leads all the intensity of the show, and there is also the clumsy dead weight that still has its importance to the progression of the story. Talking about Lisa specifically, out of everybody else, she seems the most relatable and realistic character in the mix. Most people come to hate her, but it's them that are in the wrong as if they could actually carry on terrorist tasks after just having introduced to the whole concept. She actually makes mistakes, she cries, she hesitates, but that's what make up normal humans. There is also detective Shibazuki, the only capable counterpart of the terrorists, that actually solves 90% of the riddles and act in accordance with time.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nZankyou no Terror gave me something unique that minimal shows have been able to, a realistic approach to our world and how most higher up stuff work, information can cost lives and not comparable to any fortune, and friendship can work wonders. Some people will go all the way as saying that this show was a desperate attempt to be like Death Note, where at the same time not being on good terms with themselves on what was the catch after the story. This is an original work, that yes, inspires a lot from other popular shows, but it's not something bad, as Zankyou no Terror has a resonance unique to itself. I felt for the characters, I smiled for them, I cheered for both sides and had a blast (no pun intended) doing so.\n\r\n- Overall (8.4/10):\r\nThis is a definitive rewatch material and a proud recommendation overall to both friends and family. Keep in mind the (R - 17+) rating, there are small sexual references and minimal gore, but the idea of terrorism can be a lot for the young ones to grasp or handle. I get why this show has always been highly recommended, and I can confirm that it deserves the recommendations. It's not a replica of other shows that you might have enjoyed and wants to experience something similar of, but rather, serves as its own experience.\n"
