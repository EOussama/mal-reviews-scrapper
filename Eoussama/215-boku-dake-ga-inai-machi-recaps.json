I binged through the first 6 episodes and ended up taking a break due to real-life reseason, and when I decided to come back, well, a full, fleshed out recap was in the wait for me. Fantastic.\n\r\nThe show already manages to cover a lot in just six episodes that thinking of a recapmight not be the best move to fully enjoy the show, but this one proves you wrong in the first 5 minutes, it highlights the important moments, quickly recaps through the massive information dump, with nicely placed speech bubbles, paragraph-long intel spread across the scene to make up for the fast-paced run though. I don't think it is a masu see, looking at the fact that you might be binging through the series in one sit, however, for a force of circumstance, it's like a loyal buddy that's always there for you.\n"
