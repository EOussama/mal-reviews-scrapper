    "content": "\n                I feel like Code Geas (phenomenal show) has gotten way too popular that the collective watch time of all of the extras easily tops that of the parent show, and that ends up sometimes working against the series. A hungry fan like myself can never get enough of this greatness, but at the same time puts on high expectations that match the show and end up frequently disappointed.\r\nJust this morning I reviewed a Picture Drama that spanned 8 minutes an episode and claimed it to be the longest Picture Drama I've ever watched, but not after this one, an outstanding 16 minutes, they could havepushed an extra 4 minutes and crashed it as an episode number.\r\nThe visuals are of course as the nature of the short are a progressive slideshow of still images, it's all about the dialogue in these. Which was kind f pointless, in a sense, it adds in more life and characteristic to the main cast, but it does nothing to connect with the main storyline.\n"
