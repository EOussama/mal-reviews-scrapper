    "content": "\n                Back in the starting era of my anime (or rather, my anime days ;)), I would binge-watch WatchMojo's crappy TOP 10 lists in hope to kill some time, that until I stumbled across the infamous \u201cTOP 10 anime characters deaths\u201d.\r\nIt was then when I picked up interest in anime for the first time, and it was all thanks to Makoto's featured death. School Days ONA is a pointless retelling to the first episode of the original series, just a complete replica with no extra effort put on neither the animation, not the audio work and the reason behind it is still just as oblivious.\r\nNow Ilike my School Days as much as the next guy (probably not), but this, this was just utterly despicable to put as a standalone release, unless you haven't seen the show in ages and just wanted a quick reminder on how it all started, I'd suggest keeping all the distance you can from this low-level trash. I'm still haunted by how awful the animation is that I'd swear the pixels are easily countable within the range of any first-grader. And let me raise \u201canother\u201d exclamation mark on the low-quality voice acting, besides Kotonoha's, everything sounded like seagulls screaming at a potato webcam's integrated microphone.\n"
