I don't know if that's an unpopular opinion or I'm just too much of a Shounen struck to know better, but it is what it is.\n\r\nThis show established itself as one of the most bizarre and weird Anime experiences I had the pleasure of enjoying, it's ridiculous and takes itself lightly, never too serious and desperate and that's what was the most fun. You'd think a show about martialarts would get stale and boring by the end of the first episode, after all, there is only so much you can do with throwing fists in the same direction only at different targets, but no, you're still missing out on the crack version of it all, that is, the acid trip known as Baki.\n\r\nThis show was a festival in spirit, with so many characters and so many names that you end up somehow resonating and remembering for the long run, better yet, the exchange of blows strangely makes them relatable and better to understand, they say you never know how hard a wall is until you throw your punch at it and this was all true with the character arch types in this series.\n\r\nBaki as a character feels like a greater than life, loud dreamer on a non-ending chase for greatness, or at least, his 13 years old did, and it was amazing, his relationship with his surroundings was amazing in all the weird ways which make it the more unique and interesting to follow. Yujiro Hanma too, unlike any other meathead in Anime really does leave an impression, his aura is hard felt, his intimidation radiates all over the screen, and his presence is always strong and encompasses everything and everyone around, definitely a runup for the best neutral antagonists out there, there is potential here and I'm excited to get to know more. I could run out of words here before I manage to appreciate every other character, Yuri, Hanayama, Yumi, Doppo, Tokugawa, Kato, Strydom, Gaia, Shinogi, and so on, all were amazing match-ups for Baki which makes it the more exciting and tempting to know who's next.\n\r\nThis is not a problem but it does get repetitive, there is always, somehow, a bigger, stronger world champion that was never foreshadowed or name-dropped until the point they are introduced as an opponent, it does feel like the author was making up a story as he went on, never having a clear ending in mind which also has the advantage of seeming more like adventure and coming of age story, you never know what would hit you next, but you're all on board for it.\n\r\nOverall: 7.2/10\n"
