However, upon viewing the show, I was disappointed to find that it was just a mild to good addition to the franchise, not quite living up to my expectations.\n\r\nCompared to the first season of Ple Ple Pleiades, this second season was underwhelming. While it still provided some enjoyable moments, it lacked the impact and excitement of its predecessor. The simplified character animations, while visually appealing, felt lackluster and failed to captivate me like the main series did.\n\r\nThat being said, if you're a die-hard Overlord fan,you'll likely find some entertainment in this new season. But for those who were hoping for something truly special, \"Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades 2\" falls a bit short. If you're looking for the best experience in the franchise, I'd recommend sticking to the main series rather than these side specials.\n"
