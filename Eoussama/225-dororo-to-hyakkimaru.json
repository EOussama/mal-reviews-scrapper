When Dororo was first announced and started serializing, that was a challenge for me to undertake, I didn't watch to m\u00f9iss out of the weekly hype bandwagon, so I decidedto go with the one that still has the scent of packaging, and leave the older adaptation for later to experience, perhaps watching the neer one is the way to go, as I was wishing that the production team will improve on the things that the original did wrong.\n\r\nI was satisfied, after finishing the 2019-recut, and thus, the need for watching the original series had already faded out a massive bit from what it was before, filling me with a sense of laziness that will have me go about seeing a daunting 26 episodes of black and white 50 years old animation when my backlog that has all sorts of highly praised series in it is still calling for me to dedicate the time and effort needed to seal them off for once and for good. Well, what do I have to do? So I bit the bullet and sat through what I was hesitating to watch the most. And it was quite the experience.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nI don't know what would be more shocking, seeing the original then jumping over to the recut or vice versa. Changes have been made, some for the better, but some, oh boy.\r\nJust like we set off from the recut, the original does it the same way on a narrative level, while changing up some details and character treats to suit the time period of its release. With an inspiring episodic pace, for each day its own story, which sometimes has to branch into a 2-episodes tale (A very familiar formula that we see the 2019-recut following).\n\r\nLooking at how the original tells its story, there were a lot of drop details that we didn't manage to get in the recut that are actually pretty pivotal and vitally consistent that make a lot of sense for some stuff that we never understood in the remake. Some story arcs were also missing, some of which I think make the best out of the original, like the animal abuse centric arc that I think was dropped from being re-adapted for obvious reasons.\n\r\nArt (6/10):\r\nWell, \r\nlet's be honest, it is 50 years old, and in black and white while at that. Now, it is not the aesthetic direction's fault per se, in fact, Dororo Pilotm the special episode that pre-dated this TV adaptation had colors, so the technology was there, however, they have made the right call of having it in white and black for how much atmosphere that alone adds to the scenery, demons are actually scary looking for once, and the backgrounds look so dead and rotten, perfectly conveying the tone of the narrative on a visual level.\n\r\nI was not a fan of the Astro-boy heavy inspired art style, but who is there to blame for that, at least Dororo fit that art style just nicely.\r\nMy only complaint really is the unnecessarily drag up still frames that some times would have certain characters star for lengthy periods before a fade-in transition happens which really hurts the pacing at some portions.\n\r\nSound (8.6/10):\r\n\u201cHoge Hoge Hogetara Heera Hera\u201d\n\r\nI was mesmerized. The last thing I was expecting to impress me, right after the visuals are the vocals. It is expected from something this old to have bad sound composition, but man, seriously, this one is up there with the best I've heard in Anime.\n\r\nThe voice acting was, well, very conflicted, there is so really well-done performance, like Dororo's (My favorite), the voice of a spoiled bratty child that feeds of making trouble, and you can tell that much and more just from hearing her voice, I might even put her performance slightly above, what the remake has. Hyakkimaru had a surprising deeper voice than I expected, but it grew on me more than the remake's did.\n\r\nBut the real star here was the OST and opening/ending theme song.\r\nLet me just reaffirm what Joey (The Anime Man) said, it is a freaking party bander. Well, I saw one of the comments describing it as \u201csomething that Dororo would sing, while the remake's opening was more like something that Hyakkimaru would sing\u201c. It is just a stupidly catchy song that I find myself signing it out lout even at the most serious of moments.\r\nThe OSTs are just phenomenal, most shows I watch, which still have some amazing audible compositions, this one just surprised me the most, given its age and dimmed popularity.\n\r\nCharacters (6.5/10):\r\nThere was a lot to be desired.\r\nThe only character I won't complain about is Dororo. Even her flaws are permissible given the bratty role she's enclaving, however, Hyakkimaru does not emit the proper vibes you'd get from a disabled doll seeking to slay back its humanity. For starters, he just can talk and then have enough confidence in calling Dororo out \u201cYou're just imagining what I'm saying by reading my mouth just a moment after he supposedly gained his speech back\u201d. Also, despite lacking other sense, he always acts like he doesn't and leaving it to a shameful lazy excuse to clear up the doubts when he finally gains whatever he lacked back. And don't even get me started of the Dororo's gender reveal at the end, it was just so random and sudden that it did not matter in the slightest.\n\r\nNota, the friendly dog was a welcomed member of the trio, I'm surprised they did not have him in the remake for how wholesome and fun he made everything when he was around.\n\r\nAh, Tahomaru, the persona people hated the most in the remake, saying that he lacked personality and proper development, well, will you even consider him a perper character in the original by any means? The dude screams of \u201cI'm unimportant\u201d, he had a trivial and minimal role in the whole story, like some side characters made more of an impression than him. And Daigo, well, he is more of a piece of shit in this one.\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10):\r\nFor the most part, Dororo to Hyakkimaru was daunting and kind of gritty when it came to watching it. Maybe modern Anime spoiled me far too much, but the series did have a lot of flaws, but also, some strong points that kept me going. It is hard to sit through the first half, but until you get used to it, it becomes like a bag of Doritos that you know is bad for you in large sums, but you still drill into its bottom anyway.\n\r\nOverall (6.82/10):\r\nI wouldn't necessarily have this as a recommendation, especially in this day and age where Anime is produced in a large mass. The remake is easily the best option for experiencing this story, at least, from an Anime perspective.\n"
