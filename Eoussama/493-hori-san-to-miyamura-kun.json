At first glance, it may seem deceptively simple, especially if you've watched the remake version first. But let me assure you, this anime has its own unique charm that's worth savoring.\n\r\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room \u2013 the animation. Was this show made in MS Paint? It's true; the animation might not win any awards for its visual prowess. In fact, I've seen omake episodes and picture dramasthat boasted better animation quality. However, here's the twist \u2013 this seemingly simplistic art style is like a hidden gem in itself. It sells a special kind of endearing vibe that's hard to replicate. It's as if the creators decided to take a different route and said, \"Let's make this deliberately simple, and it'll be absolutely endearing.\" And you know what? It works!\n\r\nNow, if you're coming to this version after watching the remake, you might initially find it a tad less fleshed out. But here's the thing: \"Hori-san to Miyamura-kun\" doesn't need all the bells and whistles. It's a masterclass in the art of subtlety. The story centers around Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura, two characters who couldn't be more different on the surface. Hori, the smart and popular girl, has to balance her school life with her hidden responsibilities at home. Miyamura, whom everyone sees as an otaku, harbors his own secrets.\n\r\nWhat makes this anime shine is how it gradually unravels these hidden sides and brings the characters closer. As Hori and Miyamura share parts of themselves that they couldn't with anyone else, it creates a heartwarming narrative that celebrates the beauty of authenticity and friendship. It's a reminder that sometimes, it's the simplest moments that leave the deepest impact.\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the ending songs \u2013 they absolutely slap! Despite its budget animation, \"Hori-san to Miyamura-kun\" knows how to set the mood with its music. The catchy tunes enhance the overall experience and stay with you long after you've finished watching.\n\r\nOverall: 5.6\n"
