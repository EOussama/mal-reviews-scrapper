The backgrounds, however, weren't that impressive, but it's forgivable, giving the fact you rarely move your eyes away from the characters.\n\r\n-Story (7.5/10)\r\nOK, this part is tricky, when first starting the show. The concept asa whole was and is still ridiculous and stupid, I mean, middle schoolers training to assassinate a mutated life form? Really? But it's not that bad considering the anime is a slice of life comedy (kinda), so the point is following characters who are developing along the way of the story progression, and on that part, the show did very well,\n\r\n-Characters (8/10)\r\nTremendous characters are introduced, and most if not all of them are main characters in some sort, they are all developed while the story progresses, have different treats, weak and strong points, and interesting personalities, however, the main character felt weird dare I say, he was not too forced neither was he uninteresting, in fact, you might debate that other supposedly (not mainly main characters) are better in each in appearance and charm.\n\r\n-Music (6.5/10)\r\nNothing too special, nor is it too bad, other than the openings and the ending, it was little close to awful, some shows have remarkable OST that keeps you immersed in the plot, but this show didn't seem to have all that interesting soundtracks that go along the theme in general,\n\r\n-Enjoyment (8.5/10)\r\nEven though all weak points of this show, I still had a hell of fun watching and following the plot and characters as they developed, Humor is what interested me the most.\n\r\n-Overall, I give this 7.7/10, I expected the show to be awful, unnecessary and uninteresting, but, watching it till the end, made me question the reason I avoided watching it a long time ago, I drove in with 0 expectations, and ended up loving it, good show to say the least.\n"
