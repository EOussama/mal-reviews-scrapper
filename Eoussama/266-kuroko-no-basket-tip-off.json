As we know, two particular members from the generation of miracles haven't really shown what they are capable of doing in the parent show and yet they managed to be a big part of this episode, you'd think you will finally see them on a game, but no, not yet.\n\r\nKise as a device to tell the story is, not going to lie, better than Kuroko and Kagami. The dude just has a unique protagonistic feel to him, very chill, not too care-free, and uses a greatdeal of thinking and rational when he plays. This episode really puts the relationship the generation of miracles used to have in the spotlights, building up for something id to come.\n"
