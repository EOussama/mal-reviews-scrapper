Despite the delay in the update of the latest episode, Nebu Kuro's short animation more than made up for it with its comedic charm and ability to make the audience laugh.\n\r\nThe animation is around a minute long and follows Saitama as he rushes towards a supermarket in a frantic manner. The animation is expressive and the action is easy to follow and understand despite the lack of sound. The animation feels like a mixture of Charlie Chaplin's comedic style and One Punch Man's humor.\n\r\nNebu Kuro's animationis also able to perfectly capture Saitama's character, showcasing his quick movements and ability to solve problems with ease. It was interesting to see Saitama's comical side in the animation, as it portrayed a different side of the character that is not often seen.\n\r\nThe animation also has a great sense of timing and pacing, with the comedic moments landing perfectly and keeping the audience engaged throughout the entire animation. The animation's visual design is also a highlight with the colors and details contributing to the overall comedic tone of the animation.\n\r\nThe animation is a great example of how to create a short animation that is both entertaining and memorable. It's a great way to pass the time while waiting for the update of the latest episode of the show. The animation is a great way to showcase the animator's skills, and I look forward to seeing more of Nebu Kuro's works in the future.\n"
