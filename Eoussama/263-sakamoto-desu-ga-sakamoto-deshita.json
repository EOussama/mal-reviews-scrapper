Let's leave the bittersweet ending of the parent show aside, there are those who say he really went to Mars, and there are those who believe that he died, but that's irrelevant because we get to see parallel versions of Sakamoto and his classmates in an American way and even a Martian way.\n\r\nYou could say, it was more of a recap in a way, a rehashed version of that \u201cHow I met Sakamoto\u201d episode, the new content was appreciated and the Engrish was strong with this one. Fun special.\n              "
