    "content": "\n                The One Piece movies have built a notorious hit or miss reputation with a massive catalog of 14 movies (as of now), however, Strong World was a game-changer that led the One Piece movie experience from rare extinct DVDs to the big screens and cinemas, three high budget movies in a row, all highly praised for what they set up to be until Stampede came around and caused lots of debates in the fandom on whether it carried on the compassion from the three last movies or it failed to deliver an experience on the same specter of perfection and good ol' One Piece time.\n\r\nStory(7.5/10):\r\nThe storyline in Stampede is not the most captivating one, but it speaks so well to what One Piece is. It's an epic blood rushing adventure where pirates go head to head against each other trying to win a legendary treasure left by Gol D. Roger while the Marines are middling their way into the whole conflict. Basically, a free-for-all that manages to gather so many characters, some of which date to the very early arcs of One Piece.\r\nWhat really made this movie so story-lacking is the amount of screentime that was dedicated to telling the plot, instead, it was just a massive bar fight, all for one with punches and cannonballs coming from all directions which little to no coordination.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nStampede was probably the best One Piece ever looked for 2 hours straight, the art of the character faces and postures was just right, the filter they used on the Wano arc Anime and Broly movie is very present too which makes the colors stand out more rendering the backs a touch washed off. The fights were slick and fluid, very good choreographed with good camera angles that balance cinematography and storytelling through sheer camera shake and 3D hackery.\r\nThe only nitpick here that kept me from giving a higher score was the average CGI they used on Bullet's powers, it looked very out of place with the rest of the 2D environment and characters.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe movie did well with what it extended from the Anime OST and also the newly introduced track (Bullet's track) that added so much to the One Piece collection. The voice acting was good as well, nothing shy from the usual outstanding performance we get from the weekly TV show.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nThis would have been an easy 9 or even 10 had it not been for the bad villain. This being a celebration of the entire franchise, most of the characters introduced all over the years made several cameos if not even heavily involved with the plot itself, everyone from pirates, marines, revolutionaries, civilians that we know was shown which was and still is one of One Piece's best selling points, no one is forgotten.\r\nHowever, the new faces were not as fulfilling because the movie was supposed to be carried by them and the straw hats; but they failed to deliver, most of the blame falls on the amount of action which compiles a good 80% of the entire movie, which really ate a lot of time of what could have been dedicated to build up the villains and broadcast a more believable and heartfelt backstory, the same way Z from Film Z had.\r\nBullet felt more like a Dragonball character than a One Piece one, he was all bark and gains and no basis factor that drove the entire battle to be just another random UFC fight.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nMost of the fun and enjoyment came from seeing glimpses of past characters and references to early One Piece, seeing a lot of characters that you would never have thought would stand next to each other in a single frame, the different interactions and combo attacks, it truly was a celebration that spoiled us the fans with some of the best fanservice an Anime fan can wish for.\n\r\nOverall (8.2/10):\r\nThe movie was met with a lot of hype but unfortunately, it was far from delivering on what everyone was expecting, but despite that, the essence of One Piece was still present and strong which made it a sit-through with a lot of rewatchability. One of those movies that get better the more friends are watching along.\n"
