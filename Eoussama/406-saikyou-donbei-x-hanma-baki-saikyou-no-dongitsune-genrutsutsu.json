The commercial features Yujiro Hanma, the strongest character in the Baki series, as a tailed beast-like creature that disrupts the peaceful meal of a salary man. The commercial promotes Nissin's Saikyou Donbei cup noodles, which are advertised as having thicker noodles than the regular Donbei products.\n\r\nThe commercial itself was a lot of fun to watch. The animation style was great, and it was cool to see Yujiro Hanma in a different form than what we're used to seeing inthe anime. The commercial also did a great job of showcasing the features of the Saikyou Donbei cup noodles and making them look delicious.\n\r\nOne thing that stood out to me was how well the commercial captured the spirit of the Baki series. Even though it was a commercial and not an actual episode of the anime, it still felt like it fit right in with the series. The humor was on point and the action scenes were well choreographed.\n\r\nOverall, I thought this commercial was great. It was entertaining, well-animated, and did a great job of promoting Nissin's new Saikyou Donbei cup noodles. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're a fan of Baki or cup noodles.\n\r\nAs a side note, Nissin is well known for their creative and interesting commercials, This one is no exception, the way they incorporated Baki into it was really well done, it was funny and the animation was really smooth. It's always fun to see how Nissin does their commercials and this one is no exception.\n"
