    "content": "\n                Every big series has that one movie out of many that really brings up the essence of the storyline and characters and perfectly presents itself even to non-fans, it's nostalgic, self-documenting, and has a great reachability score, unfortunately, Trigun only has one movie, and fortunately, it hits harder than 10 mediocre movies combined.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nThe story picks up midway through the canon events, before the series gets as dark as we know, with a strong vibe of villain-of-the-week where it presents a stereotypical macho baddy with a past connection with Vash, very predictable but it doesn't act too hard to hide it, the answers are clearas day from the first moment of the movie but that was never the charm of it all.\r\nThe movie has striking late 90's/early 2000's vibes, everything from the comedy to drama is well transitioned and never too far from what to expect from a series like Trigun.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nThe movie never aims to be your animation marvel, even coming from MadHouse, it's consistent I'll give it that, but never jaw-dropping, and it's fine even for a movie, as long as it had no problems delivering the entertainment it promises. I might even put some of the episodes from the original 90's series above most of the feature shots, but still good enough not to distract and immerse you out of the experience.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nI don't know how they messed it up, but everything audio-related feels like it's playing out of a 30 yo junky radio with more dust than passion.\r\nIt's not bad, maybe it helps up with the aesthetic, but it's far from amazing, maybe a tad below decent. The voice acting itself is fine, especially Vash's and Wolfwood's Seiyuus, I can't speak for the rest.\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\r\nThe movie was never focused on the main characters, but rather follows the revenge ordeal of two different parties that were anything but impressive. Amelia felt like a placeholder for any other avenger while Gasback had most the most depth to him that he felt like the real protagonist, but faith had it that he got featured in the wrong show.\r\nVash and gang are always a fun group, but they felt like a third party being involved in someone else's story.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nSurprisingly, I enjoyed this way more than I anticipated.\r\nMaybe the characters and the story were not that captivating to me, however, the setting felt like the most alive element of the whole movie, I love how crowded and dusty the environment was, how busy and loud the streets were, different conversations from left to right, it was truly a character of its own. I don't know what it is princely, but something felt very nosta&lgic and close to more than anything else in this movie, and that much I appreciate dearly. This is going to be a definitive rewatch.\n\r\nOverall(7.7/10):\r\nI would shove off this movie in the face of everyone, even if they never heard of Trigun, perhaps, it would be the right call to introduce them to the show, it captures what Trigun really is about, well, the cheerful non-dark side but that's good enough. A very easy movie to gloss through and still understand every bit of dialogue, the comedy is on point, the character interactions are amazing and the setting alone is deserving of giving this movie a watch.\n"
