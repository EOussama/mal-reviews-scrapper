I feel like the synopsis says a lot about this already.\r\nBoruto breaches in the screen with multiple clones one at a time asking for the TOHO theatre. All the portrayed characters aside from Boruto and Naruto (yes, he makes an appearance too, I guess marketing cuts the cake after all) have high piched voices that match their animalistic form. I don't know the pun behind it, but both father and son are put as a pair of foxes? was that it?\n              "
