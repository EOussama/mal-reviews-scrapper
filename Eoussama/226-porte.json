I for one, found my way here through Enen no Shouboutai (Fire Force), just trying to clear my backlog as usual, but ended up discovering a great and aspiring artist thanks to the Album with the same name, Porte.\n\r\nI loved the ending song of Fire Force, but seeing what looks like its source, as in, the original animation associated with it gives it new light and perspective. I don'tspeak Japanese, so obviously I can't make out what the song is about just by listening to it, but I can clearly make out the mood it delivers, however, seeing the animation peered with it opens up new doors, visuals, the most ancient universal language. I grew loving \u201cVeil\u201d much more and it enabled me to check out more stuff from the same artist. Well, that was for the first feature episode, the second and last one (primarily labeled as the third episode until much later) fell under the trailer-esque bait luring you into yet another franchise that I'll refrain from talking about, but the song deliberately calls out for investing it the shoutout entry.\n"
