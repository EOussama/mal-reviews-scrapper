    "content": "\n                91 Daze is a fun spin-off for the series; 91 days, that's more comedy centered, very lighthearted and carefree. But should you care?\n\r\n- Story (3.0/10):\r\nThere was no story per se, but at the same time, you could almost feel one. Saying that these shorts had no story is like saying every comedy slice of life show doesn't have one. It's just the focus wasn't around the story but the characters and their interactions.\r\nthese 2 minutes long 7 episodes go through some funny conversation between Angelo and Nero and having Corteo as a guest of honor appearing very rarely every now and then.\n\r\n- Art (6.0/10):\r\nVery Chibiand minimalistic art style used, it wasn't intended to be taken seriously, so there was no hold off on the goofiness. It worked fine I guess.\n\r\n- Sound (6.3/10):\r\nAgain, there had to be a dubbed version, I went through a lot of trouble to find the series at the first place, and then to separately find the translated script and read along the seconds, it was more like a chore than enjoyment to me. The voice acting felt comedic, but the soundtrack was lacking.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nAgain, what's not to like about Angelo, Corteo, and Nero? Three fellas having some fun time, being them tasting booze or just goofing around. It was all for fun.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.5/10):\r\nThis wasn't the least one of my highlights with watching anime, no, I didn't laugh hysterically, and I don't think I even cracked a genuine laugh, but it sure was a decent 14 minutes time killer.\n\r\n- Overall (5.8/10):\r\nI wouldn't recommend this or say it's one of these gems, the comedy wasn't all that good, and the jokes were blunt, so it's safer to skip on this if you had better stuff to do. But in case you are like me, have plenty of time on your hand and can't think of anything else to do, why not try this out?\n"
