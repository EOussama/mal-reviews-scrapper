The animation was so run-of-the-mill that I had to check multiple times if I was watching the right show. The sound department didn't do any better either, with nothing but a generic background score that didn't even try to elevate the scenes. As for the characters, I didn't even care about their existence, let alone their development. I'm sure the writers thought they were adding depth and complexity, but in reality, they were just adding layers of boredom.\n\r\nThe story was nothing but a rehash ofthe same old tired trope of a hero trying to save the world, but without any charm or originality. The pacing was all over the place, making the first half a complete snooze-fest that put me to sleep multiple times. However, the second half was a different story altogether. It was interesting, engaging, and probably on par with the best arcs from the first season. If only they had cut the first half short and focused on the second, the show could have been so much better.\n\r\nDespite all its flaws, I still managed to enjoy Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari Season 2. Maybe it's because I'm a glutton for punishment, or maybe it's because the second half was just that good. Whatever the reason, I can't deny that I had some fun watching it. So, I'm giving it a 6.97/10, and you may be wondering, why such a weird rating? Well, I did some quick math, and it turns out that's the average of all the scores I gave for animation, sound, characters, story, pacing, and enjoyment.\n\r\nI gotta say, though, the opening song was definitely a highlight for me. It had me jamming out every time it came on. But, overall, I can't help but wonder if this show has fallen under the mediocre bar. I mean, season one was pretty good, but this one just didn't quite hit the mark for me. That being said, I still enjoyed it and think it's worth a watch for fans of the series.\n\r\nOverall: 6.97/10.\n"
