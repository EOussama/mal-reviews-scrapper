This was actually fun to see.\n\r\nI liked the casual humorous vibes, it went so well with what you'd expect from a My Hero Academia episode, unlike the disappointment that was the parent movie. I sort of liked the bold lines on the art, making it closer to a comic than the movie which is always a welcomed change of pace.\n\r\nI always liked the dynamic between the Endeavor and Hawks duo, both are monsters in theirown right, but not equally as monstrous on the public eye.\n"
