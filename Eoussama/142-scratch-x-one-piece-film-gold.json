Using simple common sense, you can get a pretty clear idea of what this is going to be, nothing that heaving on an adventure or world building.\n\r\nThe whole thing might as well be called a sneaky commercial, one tactical way to correctly day give u your money, I know I would. One Piece scratch cards are the good they are trying to push here, nothing too interesting unless you had some serious excessive obsession of owning everything One Piece you see.\n\r\nI like the shortness of it, I likethe wholesomeness, it remains all too whacky, funny an in the right identity that comes with regular old One Piece that it doesn't feel like an ordinary commercial.\n"
