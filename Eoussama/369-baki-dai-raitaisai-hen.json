Doing so will completely be missing the point from Baki, this is a grindy series, probably the only fun type of grind that never gets dull, and how can it? With the ever-growing rooster of characters that never cease to amaze.\n\r\nBaki is the ultimate anti-guilty-pleasure to watch, remove the guilty part because this shit should be broadcasted on national television. It's as if the writer read the fans mind, he gathered all lovedcharacters and rounded them against each other in a tournament so there is no excuse for anyone of them to shy down from participating in the fan service that was this season.\n\r\nThe season starts exactly from where the 2018 Baki prequel left off, no time wasted, straight to the action, it covers the Chinese 100 tournament events and the recovery of Baki after the events of the last season. I know people are not about Baki in this show, I know I'm not, because so many characters easily overshadow him with their charisma, and sometimes, strength. One of which, the one, the only, Yujiro himself, it was so surreal to see the man go off for what felt like free real estate screentime, almost illegal to think about.\n\r\nOne of the biggest upgrades in this season was the animation, it was so close to the source material and with so few CGI instances that it's hard to spot any. The use of some many well blent slow-motion shots felt so organic and fluid, almost like upgrading from a 30 Hrz monitor (Baki 2018) to a 144 Hrz (This season). It was astronomical.\n\r\nThe OST this season slapped like never before, are you kidding me with that opening and ending? I almost gave in to the curse of there never be a decent OP/ED for this series, but never again.\n\r\nThis season might just have been my favorite time spent watching Baki, it had so many heights and so few lows, it was short, fast-paced, extremely funny and so hype and exciting. The writer must have higher some majors in psychology and mathematics because the amount of careful placement and shift between events and interactions felt like the product of a years-long mathematical study, targeting precisely the finest form of entertainment. It was a blast to watch the first time, and a joy to rewatch many other times.\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10\n"
