The world felt bigger and more fleshed out, the characters were even more intriguing and their interactions were top-notch. So, when Overlord III rolled around, I had high expectations. While it was still a good experience, it was slightly under what I was expecting. The previous season set the bar high, and while this one didn't quite reach that level, it still offered plenty of great moments and exciting plot developments.\n\r\nOne of thebiggest strengths of the Overlord franchise has always been its world-building and this season continued that trend. We learned even more about the various factions and characters in the world, and their motivations and desires were made even clearer. The battles and conflicts were also intense, and the animation was top-notch as always.\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't say that Overlord III was a disappointment, it did fall slightly short of my expectations. That being said, it's still a must-watch for fans of the franchise and those who love anime in the fantasy genre. If you're already invested in the world of Overlord, you'll find plenty to love in this season. But if you're just starting out, you might want to start with the earlier seasons first.\n\r\nOverall: 7.56/10.\n"
