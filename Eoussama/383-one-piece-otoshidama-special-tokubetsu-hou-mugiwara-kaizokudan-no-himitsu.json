    "content": "\n                I think this is probably the best One Piece recap there is, what makes it that is the sheer amount of content it covers and the fact that it keeps the nostalgic flair as strong and lively as ever. I could only make it through with a runny nose and teary eyes, unbelievably nostalgic and true to its root.\n\r\nThe recap starts with a cover-story-like skit before it delves into the snippets of each of the Straw Hat arcs, snipping from here and there with a charming Manga promo in between every transition. One Piece really changed throughout the years and this feels more like adocumentary than a recap.\n\r\nThere was also a weirdly placed promo for the Karakuri Castle movie (movie 7) before the Alabasta Robin part, but okay, probably a reminder that I should rewatch the One Piece movies for God knows what time now.\n"
