Yeah, yeah, that should work... And it did.\r\nWhile not the most creative titleout there, \u201cSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\u201d, or \u201cRascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\u201d, either way, it still retains a kinky feel to it, has as many similarities with its title as Mario and Wario, they don't culturally get along, but if you really thought about it, they still interact one way or another. And trust me, observations has a lot ot do with the show.\r\nMuch like Sernandoe was talked about as this horrible click baiter that never learned from his past mistakes, so was this show in the eyes of many people. A lot of angry fans of the industry breached in calling it on its supposedly \u201cplagiarism\u201d from the Monogatari series franchise, chill out people, why are you acting like it's the first time a series borrowed an aspect or two from another series, it's how things have always been in this industry, and it worked just fine. Controversy aside, and Bunny Girl senpai resides.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nThis is probably one world you wouldn't be pleasant going to.\r\nRoaring supernatural phenomena that science can't quite explain (aside from this beautiful nerd that got the whole quantum mechanic -inter-som-complex-scientific-term-here in the mix), think of it as if social harassment could physically alter reality, which if you think about it, is an already occurring thing, but not to the same degree of effect as this series goes on about.\r\nThe story is presented from the perspective of very normal people, ones that come from casual families with normal backgrounds, nothing to the extent of bolder blasting superhuman fighters. It primarily follows Sakuta, a dead-face pervy bastard that sums up most of the teenagers in attitude, working his way up to escape this curse called, \u201cAdolescent Syndrome\u201d that affected both him and his sister in the past, and has come back again to his focus as soon as he met this lovely super idol girl from the same high school he attends, lurking in a library while in a Bunny Girl suit (hence the name).\r\nThe story is kind of fast-paced as it covers a lot of side stories on its short 13 episodes length. However, it surprisingly was well directed with a lot of thought that went into it, it never feels so slow or repetitive after a while, although, I would argue that the first half was leagues above what it's become afterward (but still remained high in quality and production).\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nI mean, it's 2018 (2019 as of writing this review), good animation should be the least expected thing in an Anime, and a bad one is jail-able in my opinion, with the technologies we have, even freelance web gen animators are working wonders under their bedroom ceiling and minimal setup.\r\nI really dug the modern and fresh look if everything, the characters and the backgrounds, just one astonishing work of wonder, it makes you beg more shows had the budget and the skill to produce this much consistency in animation and art style.\r\nI've watched enough series to notice how a lot of them fall short on that, I get that having visually consistent pieces of art, a lot of times there would be slight changes in character anatomy even, probably bad camera angles or distorted lighting and shading, but never with Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai.\r\nThe vibrant colors had a strong weight to them it made for the great clumsy fun moment they usually pack into the episode. And what makes me really happy about this show is the minimal to no CGI use, at least not one that made me snip, they managed to hide it so immensely that I was never distracting.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nLet's get the opening and ending theme songs away. How can I put this into word? They were absolutely indefinitely amazing, probably the best in the season? (I guess Goblin Slayer is still there). First, you get the opening theme, this energetic catchy song of glorious Japanese lyrics that I wish I could fully understand, hopefully, one day. And then there is the ending theme that has a strange sad tone to it, it really makes me feel down whenever an episode ends, and as they always leave the juicy stuff at the end of each episode cliffhanger style, the ending theme really highlights that I only want to be left alone at a quiet night at the beat to reflect on myself while listening to it.\r\nVoice acting was yet another nailed aspect of the series, with standouts like Seto Asami, Ishikawa Kaito, Touyama Nao and more, you feel in great and trusty hands. The show packed a lot of strong emotion and it really had to have an outstanding cast of talented voice actors and actresses to get that right, I'm so fortunate to say that it didn't fall short on any of that, it's so astonishing how can a slight syllable of a voice push that tear out, so salty and bitter like a dead nostalgic meme.\r\nThere was a scene I feel had in my opinion the greatest performance in the season, where Sakuta was crying in agony and defeat at one point, it pulled some serious chills in me, I bet the voice actor of him crying the other cast on that recording session to sleep.\n\r\n- Characters (8.5/10):\r\nCharacter design-wise, if I had to vision modern Anime character designs, I would probably have characters of this show line up in my head.\r\nOne thing I'm not really bothered with, but it's almost become a cult to follow from all generic Anime series. The main cast doesn't stand out that much, they do really look like average people, even this supposedly famous social figure, I have to admit that, have I never seen this show, I would probably not be able to tell the main characters of a crown of background figures, but then again, slice of life shows are more about the \u201creal life\u201d that the audience is expected to relate to, even though the whole supernatural stuff it has makes it kind of hard to buy.\r\nOne thing they didn't neglect, which is a crucial rule of thumb of making a successful, is how well written a character is. Again, the audience is supposed to relate to the show, only that says a lot about the \u201clife\u201d part in \u201cslice of life\u201d, a simply throwing irrelevant characters with either way too perfect personalities or strangely out of world treats would be a big no-no and would never work in this genre. We have an extremely realistic collection of characters, each with interesting feats and distinguishable ideology.\r\nTake Sakuta for an example, the lead protagonist fellow under the skin of your casual highschooler, very dirty minded and perverted, which syncs very well with his age demography with a unique dead-face expression and very subtle sense of humor (that comes mostly from him being that much dead in the eye). Both his unironic easy nature of saying whatever is rolling in his mind with no regret, and his good intention of wanting the good for others. And then, there is the queen of waifus in the eyes of many, his girlfriend Mai, the typical older significant other, that looks all that much wiser and more expert at dealing with the grownup world. The same leader of the Bunny Girl cult, it had a great following this season.\r\nThere is also the nerdy Futaba that retains all rights to the waifu chamber as well, the same girl that probably brags privately on how she could subtly explain anything in a formal quantum mumbling. And the list goes two levels or three deeper than that.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI would have gone with a slightly higher score if I could, as Seishun Buta Yaru wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai went from being a scary and obscure long title with a language other than my first tongue's, to something I would spam saying out loud in front of friends and family just to let my inner weeb inform them on what level of weeb-ness I've got to. And it was a fun exercise and a great excuse to burn some verbal calories.\r\nThere is so much that this show did great in my eyes that writing a full list of that now would wear me out of finishing this review.\r\nOne major aspect of that would be the storytelling, especial in the first half, that's for me, the most fleshed out and blood boiling part of the series that does a lot more than simply introducing the characters.\r\nThe supernatural touch had a strong presence in rolling down the action, and honestly, could be the selling point about this series, while they tried to milk as much sense out of it as possible, although it wasn't required to nail the experience, it was still appreciated, I for one, wasn't ready to get lectured on complex quantum mechanics that my poor brain will never grasp, it was a nice way to keep the characters interacting, like energetic young team of dodgeball, you never know who's going to get hit next, it's almost as a roll call, and that was really thrilling about this series, you'd always be \u201cwho's next, oh I can't believe this happened to that...\u201d, stuff like this can make simple sitting in front of a screen watching animated 2D figures be more of an interactive dilemma, even more so as you get in more affection with the characters.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nI feel as if I hadn't expressed how much of a high-quality show this show was, it really takes character writing and story direction as a slice of life show to a new standard compared to other shows of the same release time span. I'm sure it's going to get even more popular (not that it's short on that as of now) and probably become a classic to speak nostalgically about in a few years. And you see, I'm by no means a slice of life fanatic, my area of interest would be shounen if I had to be honest, and still, this was one great well-directed piece of storytelling that will force me to update my all time favorites when it comes to the genre.\r\nAgain, the show isn't really that much hard on mature content, at least, not on the length of going full naked and touchy, there are still a bunch of sexual references that don't make a good job at being sneaky so nobody gets the hang of it, so watching this next to a miner would be something to avoid, especially that the man character is one glorious straightforward bastard.\n"
