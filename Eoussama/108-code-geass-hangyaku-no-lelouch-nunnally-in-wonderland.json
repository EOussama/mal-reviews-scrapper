    "content": "\n                As the title implies, just the classic of Alice in Wonderland, Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch - Nunnally in Wonderland took the basic idea and altered it to convey the jokes and the references of the parent series in a humorous way, full of fourth-wall breaking and circle jerking.\r\nIn a summery quite day, under a tree, Lelouch and Nannually were bonding together as they usually do until she asked him to tell her a story, and so he delivered. The OVA drew a lot of specifics from Alice in Wonderland but really added a lot and made it its own parody with the wide charactercast.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nIt was really good, mainly still images with a few containing basic animations, but the quality was just as consistent and felt of a higher class. The clothing especially was a greatly portrayed, although was a bit too sexually expressive, with a lot of subjective revealing clothes and over the top breast juggling, some people would appreciate that, but some others think it's just a distracting pointless jerk move.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nIt started at first with only Lelouch and Nanually exchanging conversations with having other characters remain silent until they all burst to talk.\r\nThe good performance can be easily picked up, the soundtracks of the original series were reused here, and we all know those are some of the greatest.\n\r\n- Enjoyment: (7.5/10):\r\nIt was better than I was ready for at least. Seeing a Code Geass parody on a classic is one of the things you'd never ask for but would still be glad to have experienced. I had some giggles, was really pleased to see the old characters, it really felt like it delivers on so much more.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nFor sure, one of the greatest OVAs out there, I avoided it so much until I set myself to watch it, and was slapped in the face for why I hadn't gotten into it any earlier.\n"
