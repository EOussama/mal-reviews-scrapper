That song has an incredible ability to make you drown in an ocean of nostalgia, I don't know how they do it, but it always works like an ancient charm.\n\r\nBasically, you get the majority of captains and their lieutenant flashing on the screen like some card game ad, throwing one-liners all of the places while the fire OST is playing, the art style looks very odd, almost rehashed over its TV counterpart.\n              "
