What kept the scenes going were the erotic voice acting that makes the short closer to being a hentai if you were to close your eyes and imagine stuff based on what you hear.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nI like that they went ahead and included pretty much every major girl in the series, specifically a woman we never thought we needed, Grayfia, Lucifer's wife, oh boy, just what we were missing from the parent series.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nIt was an okay experience, had some giggles, the fanservice was so intense that you wouldn't want somebody to catch you watching it, you'd rather sacrifice being seen watching twitch THOTs than this.\n\r\n- Overall (6.4/10):\r\nIf you're a fan of fanservice, and most of us are, this is differently something you'd want to see, although, not as good as the previous short series, it differently sets off the tone after the intense events of the third season.\n"
