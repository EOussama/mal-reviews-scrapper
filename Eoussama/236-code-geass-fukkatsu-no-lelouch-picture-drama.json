The first episode shows a pirate with an interesting grass power that acts as a lie detector, questioning the main cast that he holds hostage, and the second one is just the girls enjoying a Turkish bath.\n\r\nI liked the art quite a bit, that is, compared to what I've seen from the past Picture Dramas, it's sharper, the colors are vibrant, closer to a water painting.\n              "
