I know it's hard to believe, nudity is everywhere, but I feel that the first season did its trick on us, and gave us our share of fanservice only to let us focus on the plot later with no distractions.\r\nHigh School DxD New improves on its prequel on so many levels, it's no longer about nasty perverted stuff, although that's what dragged us into theseries in the first place, this story turned out to be with a more involving plot that we might have anticipated.\n\r\n- Story (8.7/10):\r\nThe first season was really weak in terms of storytelling, we got introduced to the three major factions yes, we did have the first club members introduced, I know, but it really was just a mess out of fanservice that didn't know when to end.\r\nHigh School DxD New gave more attention to telling the actual story while also retaining a controllable amount of fanservice. in this second installment of the franchise we get to see more light spots on various characters, their origins, and motives, their dreams and relationships.\r\nAlso, this time around, a more greater danger was approaching, and even more worldbuilding was made in terms of villains, allies. I would actually, finnaly be true to myself, and call Highschool DxD a good story with an insane lore ranking slightly below other amazing titles,  such as One Piece and No Game No Life.\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\r\nNot the most amazing thing to say the least, but not as bad either, it certainly is better by a small margin than that of the first season but not so much noticeable.\r\nWhat can I say really, in terms of anatomy, the female's are just as much or even more erotic that I can remember, I know you're in for some exciting body bumps, so have some high hopes, you won't be let down.\r\nThe animation was decent, really, nothing compares to a high budget movie production, but there is really nothing that would make you go; \u201cEww\u201d or anything.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThe installment had its share of amazing sound-work, the soundtracks are the same ones from the first season, and those were just spectacular, so no complaints here.\r\nThe thing I wasn't quite pleasant here is the existent of 2 opening theme songs for a mere 12 episodes of content, while the first opening theme song was just amazing, very catchy (but not as good as the first season's), the second one didn't quite click to me. The ending theme songs were also great, especially the last one.\r\nThe voice acting here remains as one of a high quality, I can't pick one above the other here, you get the feminine tone of voice when the females speak something erotic and also get intense performances on their respective moments.\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\r\nThis is character development at its finest, I would even argue that great series like Fullmetal Alchemist and the likes of it pale in comparison, this is definitely a trophy winner.\r\nWe get to meet a lot of cool characters in this season, surprisingly not only females but male characters, speaking about the great Azazel, such a cool design, and personality.\r\nBack to our old character, take Kiba for instance, I would say, he got the most focus of this season, probably the most developed character in the series so far. I would bet that if there was somebody who didn't give Kiba any credits of attention at first would change his or her minds now that we got his backstory. The same can be told about Akeno that also had some play time here.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.4/10):\r\nI'm being very honest here, I really liked this series, I never got this kind of feeling while watching a harem or ecchi before, those were to me like more of a pleasure and giggles than actual enjoyment, but this is a game changer, my balance breaker.\r\nI got everything I wanted with extra, I really dug the story, and for that alone, I'd attempt to rewatch the whole series sometime in the future.\r\nI enjoyed the characters way more in this season, they had a depth to themselves, especially the ones that didn't have that much focus on the first season.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nI've always been skeptical about recommending Harem/Ecchi series to friends, but not anymore, or at least, not with this one. I'm really thankful to that one guy who recommended this series, I didn't know I needed this at first, but it was a hell(pun intended) of a good watch. Yes, I would definitely recommend watching this if you've already seen the first season if you didn't enjoy the first that much, this one is absolutely an improvement that has more quality and distance between it and the first season than the iPhone smartphone brands.\n"
