It feels like redemption, it cries of regret, but most importantly, it relates to most of us, and we all haveour own struggle.\r\nThe voice chords feel to me like something very interesting the like of which you don't see very often taken advantage of in Anime, most of the time it's all energetic with a great sense of pop, basically the same thing over and over again, but this one makes you feel like wearing brand new socks. They are not the most exciting things in the world, but got does it feel good strap your legs into a fresh pair of socks. But maybe I'm just getting old.\r\nAs generic as the song is, the abstract black and white sketch-like drawings help with that a lot, as if you're presented with the foundation (the sketch) and tasked to flesh out your own story surrounding the nameless protagonist at the center, going through several struggles as his body adjusts in different poses almost every frame trying to put off the flaming mess that's covering him. And so he does at the end, it sure took time and many attempts, but he finally did it as you could feel the relief in his eyes as he rests them at the very end.\n"
