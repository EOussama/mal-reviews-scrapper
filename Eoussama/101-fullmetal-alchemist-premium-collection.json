    "content": "\n                It has definitely left a back mark on our memory, speaking about \u201cThe sacred start of Milos specials\u201d. Certainly, a lot of fans agree with me on this, and here it came again, specials for another Fullmetal Alchemist movie, a more successful one might I add, \u201cFullmetal Alchemist: Premium Collection\u201d. Spanning 3 episodes filled with fourth wall breaking and semi-hilarious references to the show and movie just like a cast celebrating after their major success.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nAll three episodes look to have been animated differently, the first one was just spectacular with the fast-paced action it had, it required an animation just as fast andfluid and that was what it had.\r\nThe second episode had everything deformed (as referred to by the MAL synopsis), and it was just fine looking how unnecessary animation compared to the first one would have felt like. The third one was kind of meh, it had only short wholesome and slow moments so go figure.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nPretty decent I'd say, it was crazy enough to make sense of the humor that was going on and actually worked, unlike more of the times in the parent show.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.2/10):\r\nCompared to the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood's movie this was high-class tier, a lot of funny moments mainly through bag punching characters and playing the opposite\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nAn actual collection of specials worth their time, I'm double positive that you'll treasure these especially if you're a fan of the parent series. I'm not the biggest fan of it out there, and I don't even have a fresh memory of it in general and still got a blast.\n"
