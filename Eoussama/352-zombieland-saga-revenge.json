The voice acting too was very good and full of energy.\n\r\nThe characters were the real selling point of this sequel, even more so than the first season, we get more backstory, more expansion, a lot of setups that really bring out the greatness inside all and each one of the girls, and even Kotarou.\n\r\nZombieland Saga Revenge was what season one was and more, a great showing for how an idol show can be a lot more than just dancing and singing, with a bigger WTF ending than most shows out there, it truly was the sleeper show of its season and deserves more recognition.\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10)\n"
