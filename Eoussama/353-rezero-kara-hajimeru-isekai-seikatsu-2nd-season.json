I can't be wrong two times in a row with the same show, right?\n\r\nI was wrong yet again.\n\r\nThere was so much wrong with this season, and now, that I have already finished the second part, I would have been muchbetter had the two parts made up one single season, but they just had to do it.\n\r\nWhat hurt me more is the fact that the show really stood up strong with the first installment, but went for an entirely different, slowed, and rather boring plot. For starters, the whole thing felt like an oozing bite-size exposition of a much grander arc that honestly would have been better served in a more fast-paced manner. The fact that we've been stuck in the same location, doing the same things over and over again, it reminded me of the awful cringe-worthy middle part of the first season when Subaru made the same mistakes over and over again. Displaying a great deal of insignificant repetitive plotline that gets on your nerve as early as episode three.\n\r\nGone is this angelic Mary-Sue picture that season one painted over Emilia, she's been exposed as the weak, insecure dead weight to everybody around her, which is, in all honesty, a good thing for her character, a great weakness that she'll have to overcome one day. But the lack of any noticeable improvement during the entire season really takes a toll on everything, 12 episodes where you feel like nothing is happening, and everyone is stuck on a non-ending loop that promises no conclusion.\n\r\nAs I said, this part is more of a preparation for whatever comes next, and I can't help but think the business handshake that led to this decision was misled in all the wrong ways.\n"
