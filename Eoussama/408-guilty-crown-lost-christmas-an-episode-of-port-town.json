Let me just say, I was beyond thrilled when I found out that this animated short was bundled with the limited edition release of the PC game. I mean, who wouldn't want more of the hot mess that was the main series, right? But let me tell you, this short was a real game-changer.\n\r\nFirst of all, the animation was top-notch. I mean, it's not like the main series had any animation worth praising, but this short truly raised the bar. The fight scenes were intense, the character designswere fresh, and even the backgrounds were well done. It was like watching a completely different show.\n\r\nBut what really sets this short apart is the dynamic between Carol and Scrooge. These two characters had more chemistry in the short's runtime than the entire main cast did in the entire series. Their interactions were compelling and even had me feeling something (which is more than I can say for the main series).\n\r\nBut let's be real here, even with all of its improvements, it's still part of the Guilty Crown franchise. And let's face it, that franchise is beyond saving. But hey, at least we got this short as a silver lining. I mean, it's not like we'll ever get a reboot of the show with Carol and Scrooge as the main characters, but a man can dream, right?\n"
