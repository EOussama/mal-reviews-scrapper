The series takes us on a journey alongside Naruto's son, Boruto, as he navigates his way through the ninja world. The development of the next generation of shinobi is intriguing, and we get to witness the growth of familiar characters and their dynamic relationships. The action sequences are intense, the emotional moments tug at our heartstrings, and the overarching plot gradually unfolds, keeping us engaged and invested.\n\r\nThe Filler Frustration:\r\nHowever, it's impossible to ignore the elephant in the room\u2014the abundance of filler episodes that outnumber the canon content. These fillers often disrupt the pacingand dilute the overall experience. As fans eagerly anticipate the progression of the main story, they are met with seemingly endless arcs that contribute little to the overarching narrative. This excessive filler can be frustrating and lead to a sense of disappointment, leaving viewers longing for more meaningful content.\n\r\nAn Overhated Gem:\r\nDespite its flaws, Boruto has been subject to excessive criticism and hate. The comparisons to its predecessor, Naruto, are inevitable, and while it may not match the same level of intensity and depth, it offers a fresh perspective on the ninja world. It introduces new characters, explores different themes, and tackles issues that resonate with a younger audience. Boruto deserves a chance to establish its own identity rather than constantly being measured against Naruto's legacy.\n\r\nEmbracing the Potential:\r\nThe key lies in striking a balance between the canon story and the filler content. Boruto has demonstrated its potential in delivering captivating narrative arcs and character development, but it needs to find a way to prioritize these aspects over the abundance of fillers. By focusing more on the main story and utilizing fillers sparingly or creatively, Boruto could truly flourish and captivate fans both old and new.\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIn the vast world of Boruto, there is a mix of greatness and frustration. While the abundance of filler episodes may dampen the overall experience, the canon material offers compelling storytelling and character growth. Rather than dismissing Boruto entirely, it deserves a chance to prove itself as a worthy addition to the Naruto universe. By embracing its potential and striking a balance, Boruto has the opportunity to become a captivating series that stands on its own. So let's give it a fair shot and see what adventures await in the shinobi world of Boruto.\n\r\nOverall: 7.26/10.\n"
