    "content": "\n                It became a staple at this point, and I gotta say I'm glad it did. Recap episodes only increase accessibility while at the same time remaining an entirely optional approach to watching a series. But sometimes, or should I say, most of the time falls short on delivering the complete or most of the experience that watching the whole show is pron to provide. It's by no mean the best way to approach a series, but for regulars of the show, people that rewatch series often, it's a time saver many people underrate to the depth of the abyss.\n\r\nThis recap episode goes through the firstcour of SAO:A War of The Underworld which byitself was a pretty short and fast paced climax of Alicization that rendered Kirito from the Dual Wielder to the Dual Wheeler.\n"
