While browsing the seasonal chart, picking up shows that I caught my interest until I ended up with an odd number. I love my numbers, but even more so, the even ones, so Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai was the pick that balanced up my seasonal collection of the time, hoping I would grow fond of it, episodes by episode, it turned up to be even better than the shows I was especially hyped about.\r\nEventually, the season ended, and the show left a noticeable void that I was only able to overcome whenI knew about the second season's announcement, and it was in the same year. Sweet.\n\r\nBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! was just the continuation I was waiting for; a sequel that lives up to your expectation, airing relatively shortly after its prequel when the anticipation is still present, and the community is still engaging.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nThe classic Harem trope embracing, mondegreen centered waifu driven slice of life continues in a manner that does not discard its identity. It doesn't attempt to bringing anything new to the table, risking throwing off devoted fans, it does not innovate and encloses on what made it so loveable. It only gifts back what we've grown to love about it, almost as both seasons were no more than just a cour that went together back to back with no chronological shifts in-between. Naryuki's season one on the last night was the same Naryuki the next morning in season two, and so were the other girls.\r\nFollowing the direct events of the first season, Naryuki continues to help the main trio, Ogata, Furahashi, and Uruka while also keeping his acquaintance with Kirisu sensei and Kiminami.\r\nAs the school year comes to a close, and everyone is forced to make their life-changing decision, they each learn to overcome their differences and strengthen their bonds further so that the inevitable parting is never too harsh on any of them.\n\r\nThe pacing and linear plot progression kept up the semi-episodic serialization which works perfectly with the short character arcs that occupy the greater part of the series, escaping from the enclosing dead-line that was the end of the school year.\n\r\nArt (7.6/10):\r\nI would say that the premise of Harem shows lies within the characters and plot interactions rather than the visual notes. However, the power of the visual is an important aspect that gives or takes points from a Waifu candidate.\r\nBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! keeps up a generic visual facade, with clunky designs that can easily mistake the main characters from background crowds. That is if it wasn't for the clever and assertive use of vibrant colors to highlight them apart.\r\nIt's arguably the standard in the Harem blueprint that the visual quality and attention to details always shifts towards the Waifus, the main selling point of this type of shows, the protagonist always settles with probably the most generic and boring design as a way of making him or her relatable to the viewer; as the protagonist's sole purpose is to link the Waifu gang, with the Waifus themselves are there to gain the audience's praise.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nIf there was anything that stuck with me after finishing the first season, it was the opening and ending bundle it featured throughout its run. The second season inherited the same fidelity when it came to the vocals. Both the opening and ending theme songs were great, very considering to the mood and atmosphere that goes with the show.\r\nThe voice acting is as good as the first season, great audible performances that encapsulated the frequent comedic inserts so well that the tone of voices delivered alone was able to draw out some laughter.\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\r\nI've talked about this before, I'll assert it more again. Characters are the single most important aspect that makes a Harem stand out, without it, a Harem is just a sorry excuse for one. Characters with no personality or likable, relatable, or interesting traits can easily affect and downgrade everything else that the show has going for it.\r\nAnother season, more character development for everyone.\r\nWhat I really appreciate about this season over the last one is how drastically Nariyuki grows as both a mentor, a big brother, and a person as a whole, not just the main girls, but the protagonist as well shows a lot to be developed. He's no saint, he makes mistake, and he works hard to correct them and improve himself as he does helping others improving themselves as well that it goes full circle in the greater scale of things.\r\nAnother great example of good character development shows on Furuhashi's sake. I never really invested in her, I never genuinely cheered for her, but this season made me do just that without even realizing it, I went from a firm believer in the Uruka x Naryuki ship to having a respectful consideration to Furuhashi all in a couple of episodes. Sadly the Ogata bandwagon wasn't as strong in this one, and that was my first ship when I started the show, however, the Uruka ship keeps sailing, hoping that in the third season (Please give it to us) she would take the lead once again.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI knew I wanted to watch more ever since I finished the first season.\r\nThe spectacle that grew on me at the start of the year has only grown even more by the end of it, week after week following these high schoolers ' hilarious, dramatic, and emotional ordeals, cheering for different ships every now and then. Signing along with the theme songs and engaging in fan Waifu discussions. It was priceless, and only fueling my need for the third season.\n\r\nOverall (8.02/10):\r\nBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is a shining gem in a genre that has gained a toxic cult following that throws off newcomers. It is such a simple premise that gains your back tons of enjoyment, and this Anime shows that by example. Great characters, frequent hilarity, and Mary Sue Waifus. If you've already made it passed the first season and are hungry for more, don't hesitate, just WATCH!\n"
