I don't have any good punchline to end this note on.\n\r\nIt felt almost unbelievable, trying to hope in the hype bandwagon, but you're just too lazy to rewatch a whole season in order to refresh your memory on the show, and then you stumble across this.\r\n\u201cOne Punch Man 2nd Season Commemorative Special\u201d is a linear retelling of the major plot threads of the first season of the series that goes through narrating over the highlights with a very uncanny robotic host-show-like voice. I did not enjoy that as much as I wasexpecting.\r\nIt definitely didn't cover most of your favorite moments, but it was decent for what it was. Just refreshing your likely dead memory and setting some hype up for the second installment of the franchise.\n"
