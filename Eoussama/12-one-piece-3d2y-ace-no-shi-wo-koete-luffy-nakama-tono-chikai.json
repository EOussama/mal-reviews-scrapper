    "content": "\n                Well well well, The last 1.5 hour or so was considered a special but felt like a movie\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nIn a nutshell, an adventure that Luffy endures while training with Rayleigh, it took place between the 2 years gap, we got to see Luffy fight together with Boa, we had some giggles every now and then which is expected from one piece content, Luffy developed well durry this special, as we see him advancing in controlling his Haki abilities, He still showed a very sensitive spot on his brother's incident tho, but he'll overcome it an upcoming point.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThe typical One piece art, theanimation was fluid of course, Luffy's outfit looked so stylish, and the second gear's scenes where animation amazingly.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nNothing very remarkable, your very usual meal of One Piece soundtrack, the hype, and emotion remain.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nYet another One Piece spin-off, and of course other new characters, referring to the World's pirates here, they stand out for a good villains, World's backstory was convincing enough to build him up to be the way he's now, having to endure that, and being betrayed by your Nakama, spending 30 years in Impel down is no easy task, The guy just wanted revenge which is, of course, typical in those situations.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nTotally loved what I watched, would I recommend it? Most diffidently, it's such a good watch after you finish the first half of the series.\n\r\n- Overall (8/10):\r\nI really enjoyed this movie, the event weren' that rushed, It didn't contradict the main, plot that much, so I'm fine with it.\n\n\r\nFor those who skipped the ending cutscene, go see it, an awesome character 'S' made an appearance, and it was on point too, <3\n"
