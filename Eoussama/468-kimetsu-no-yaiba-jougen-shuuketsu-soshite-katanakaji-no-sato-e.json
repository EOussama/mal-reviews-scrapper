The Infinity Castle sequence was so gorgeous that it's flabbergasting how impossible to surpass what they make it look like every time. Theinclusion of the climax fight from last season was great to see on the bigger scene, but the real star was the Swordssmithing Village arc content.\n\r\nThe whole intro sequence really, was booming with talent, from animation to sound design, voice acting to pacing and cinematography. It was too good to be true at times.\n\r\nThis was the first time this show made me laugh. I found that the humor had better delivery and timing in this new ac, subtle, but way more effective. The new characters look interesting as also the newly introduced demons.\n\r\nThe opening theme at the end was very good, song and visual-wise. The whole thing was so good that it's getting boring writing anything bashful about it in this review.\n\r\nOverall: 8.46/10.\n"
