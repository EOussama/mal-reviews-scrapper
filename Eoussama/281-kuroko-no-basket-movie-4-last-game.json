    "content": "\n                NOTE: Please read with caution for this review consists of several spoilers from the movie that might affect your experience with it.\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges that writers deal with when coming up with a continuation of an already concluded story is the seamless transition between old to new content. If your characters have already had their resolution, what else to write about? But in Kurko no Basket's stead, the cannon TV series' finale already felt like an interrupted sports program, and if that did not help, Sports, in general, are about the challenge rather than the destination, so inherently, the genre of this storygives free passes for limitless spin-offs or even plot expansion on demand.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nRight after the end game of the third season, a new challenge has the Generation of Miracles bond together in order to face, a foe so formidable that the all of them were required to form a one-off team of dreams to save face and pressure a group of the world-renowned street basketball team to eat their words after humiliating and talking badly about basketball in Japan. There is really no story to recognize other than a standalone intense game of Basketball, the motive behind this felt kind of forced as though the writers were looking for the slightest excuse to force this game to make happen, but the pay-off is making for all of that.\r\nThe game did not feel dragged or longer than it should, very intense and never boring with minimal dialogue and actual play. Every player on cour got to shine and show off their skills.\r\nFast forward to the end of the movie, it becomes straight up apparent that this is less of a spin-off screening and more of a real conclusion to the story as it devolves into what happens to Kagami and Kuroko and how they are planning their separate futures.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nAs if the original TV show wasn't much of eye candy already, the art style in this one is so true and more faithful to that of the Manga.\r\nThe animation doesn't fall short on delivering also, you know the key Zone moment has to have the most fluid and organic flow from frame to frame so that it looks seamless and sells the movement and speed in a more believable manner.\r\nThe use of CGI is even better and less noticeable in this movie, as they say, good 3D is the one that blends well with 2D that it's almost as if it's nonexistent.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nI think the play of the basketball is way too powerful of a visual immerse that everything else pales in compassion. My memory is kinda hazy but a beat was present there, perhaps remixes of the OSTs from the parent show as well. The voice acting was as generic as any other episode from the TV show.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI mean, the TV show has already expanded so much on the main cast, that it leaves nothing else to discuss regarding them, but somehow, Akashi's resolution find its way into this movie, and thus his split-personality finally got a good wrap up arc that was very consistent with the mini-story that plays in-parallel to the game.\r\nThe opposing team was nothing very special, the character design was cool, to say the least, however, personality-wise, they brought nothing new to the table and felt more like a placeholder for any strong team that could shake the Generation of Miracles.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.2/10):\r\nWhat a great watch it was. Non stop blood thrilling moments one after the other, literally, a fan-service movie that fulfills all the fantasies you had about the main character and all the team-ups you've ever wanted. What's even better is the rewatchability, it's insane, I was ready to jump straight back in after finishing the movie.\n\r\nOverall (8.34):\r\nThis is the types of movies that you can safely watch or show to a friend that hasn't seen any of the parent show and still get an immense sense of enjoyment out of. It's very easy to follow, doesn't really have that spoilers either, nothing too important, and really makes you in the spirit of re-watching the series again and again.\n"
