Sure we were introduced to the rivalry at hand, set up a tournament that would span 3 seasons, but the in-between team member drama and progression were kind of left out.The characters seemed like they had a story to tell, but their voices were never heard.\r\nWith this second season, after Seirin trained hard for the entirety of the first season, finally getting the big fishes. Kuroko has seen massive growth and has had several backstories explaining his relationship with various members of the Generation of Miracles. Kagami too has finally hit the right strings, with a personal backstory that finally made sense, it set up where he was coming from and explained the motives that drove him in both seasons and onwards. The pacing was good, it could have been much better, I hoped the season would have had more games to focus on though.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nThey had me balling my eyes on this one. The first season had a fine art direction, with animation spiking only at the crucial moments and this one followed on the same principle, however, it had a lot of epic and movie-quality-animation worthy moments that get you screaming, \u201cget me a Basketball Goddamnit\u201d. Again, it fed off of the common sports Anime trope where the screen would be spammed with countless shocked reaction faces, but when they call is made, you can almost see blood pumping from the players' veins, the sweat drops beautifully reacting and the fluid moves that transition like an elegant dance.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nI would say that the first season is still crowned for its amazing first opening and good second, however, this season has its fair share of epic openings. The animation though on the first opening sequence surpasses anything else in the franchise, as far as the song goes, not so much. The second ending song, however, is the best of the best.\r\nThe voice acting was good I guess, nothing more notable. The OST was banging though. I wish they kept the suspense track from the first season's recap.\n\r\nCharacters (8.4/10):\r\nDefinitely a step up in every direction. Everything I complained about previously seemed to have been addressed in this season. Kuroko, for example, moves from being this static passing-tool to someone that fights and sweats for his team to the last drop. And Kagami from a thick-headed rushing-storm to a more down to the earth team player.\r\nI wish Kise would have had more screentime but it seems as the first season focused heavily on him and Midorima, this one delves to expand and introduce on Aomine and Murasakibara which are both great rivals and antagonists in a way.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI feel like season 2 was definitely the climax that the first season was setting up to. It was totally worth the grind through the first 24 episodes even for the people that didn't enjoy it as much as they thought they would. I adored Seirin even more, the dynamic between the members and Kuroko with the other Generation of Miracles member. I loved the concept of the Zone and the two last games were just out of this world.\n\r\nOverall (8.28/10):\r\nI would say, even to my past self, this is more than the first season alludes to. It is a tier above even its predecessor, definitely that one sequel that carries everything before it.\n"
