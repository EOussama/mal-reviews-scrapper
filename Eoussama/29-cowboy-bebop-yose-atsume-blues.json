    "content": "\n                An absolute classic, love it or hate it, Cowboy bebop has spanned across a wide audience, making millions of fans all over the world, the show may seem American on its core, but it managed to pull interest from people with different cultures, is it the animation? no, maybe the story? probably both,; or even something else, either way, all of us who watched the origin series, can relate, this one, however, is special release, that never been aired outside of TV programmes, and only made it as a Bonus episode, showing off what a portion of the audience might have missed...\n\r\n- Story (5.0/10):\r\nThere isno story backing up this animation per say, an all in one description would call this, a compilation of shots from scenes that never made it on Tokyo's TV programmes of the Cowboy series, due to excessive violence and suggestive content, all there is to it, is some philosophic commentary by the main cast, across all different the thirteen fist episodes.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nI've always admired this unique feel of the Cowboy Bebop animation, the colors and art style are just a rare type of eye candy, that seem to have extracted from modern animations, you don'\"t get unbelievably beautiful characters with exaggerated eye sizes, or explicit body anatomy, no, it's all based on realistic human anatomy and faces, most of the characters are ugly, reflective, that's what we get in real life, it's a lot more suited to works that expand on our societies.\n\r\n- Sound (5.0/10):\r\nI'm giving this one a high score just because the nostalgia I'm getting is killing me right now, and as they sauy, nostalgia is a drug, the opening and ending songs, ugh, I'm getting back those days of my first experience with the main series,  the soundtracks are just a killer in this one, but as for the voice acting, I watched the original in the english DUB, and that xwas one of thebest I've seen, I couldn't really take the most of this one, as I only stumbled accorss the SUBed version, but no more complains right?\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nWe get to see the Bebop crew all over again, not for long though, just snippets of what it seemed to be a great journey up ahead, the way how Fye sounds like a desperate young adult, that's very skeptical about her backstory, or Jet, the guy who's been stabbed many times in the past, both physicaly and emotionally, and then, we get our careless Ed, and his companion Ein, and finally, there is the cool badass dude, that acts and sound cool all the time without being so boring and predictibale, Spike, the crew does vary in personality, and as we 've seen on the priginal, they do fight moung thjemselves a lot, but something is strong keeping them all together, that strange nbond is a first for me.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nAs much as I love this series, I couldn't feel the same way I did watch the original or the movie, this was very blunt for me, probably because I got used to the English voice acting when it comes to this one? I did enjoy the philosophic talk though, whilst it kept consistent with what was going at that point in the story, it meant something more, but some others were just terrible if taken out of context, like what Ed said about following strangers, probably that's why there were so many cuts from the series huh?\n\r\n- Overall (7.0/10):\r\nI would probably not be that excited to talk about this pick or bring it up on anime related conversations, Many people do not enjoy Cowboy Bebop for the classic it is, many of which are the youngsters, and I can understand where they are coming from, but still, this episode doesn't really add much to the experience as a whole, it's only for those hardcore fans, who would like to see more of the Bebop folks, no matter it was.\n"
