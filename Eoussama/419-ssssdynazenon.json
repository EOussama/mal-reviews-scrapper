The character designs are hot, like I want a whole series around Mujina hot.\n\r\nSSSS.Dynazenon, where do I even begin? It's like Tsuburaya Productions said \"Hey, let's take the already epic SSSS.Gridman, add in some giant robots and a cast of characters that are so quirky and endearing, you'll never want them to leave.\" And that's exactly what they did. The character designs alone are enough to make you fall in love, but when you add in a storyline that's both heartwarming and bittersweet, you've gota winner.\n\r\nLet's talk about the main character, Yomogi. Normally I'd roll my eyes at a high school student being the hero, but not in this case. He's got more heart and soul than most people twice his age, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked him. And don't even get me started on Gauma, Yume, and Koyomi, the dynamic between the entire cast is just fantastic. The Eugenicists as villains may not have been the most interesting storyline, but as separate cast members, they were so full of life and personality, it was like watching fireworks go off.\n\r\nThe blend of 2D and 3D animation was just perfect, considering this is a kaiju show, and it was executed so well. I mean, it's not like I expected anything less from Tsuburaya Productions. The opening and ending songs were like SSSS.Gridman's, but in a good way. And the voice acting, oh my gosh, it was like they were born to voice these characters, they brought the key moments to life.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the character development, it was so noticeable, especially for a 12-episode-long show. It's like they took all my favorite coming-of-age stories and packed them into this little gem. I never thought I'd find myself so invested in a kaiju show, but here we are. My love for kaiju has been unexpectedly lit on fire, and I'm forever a changed man.\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for a show that's both hilarious and heartwarming, with a cast of characters that will steal your heart, look no further than SSSS.Dynazenon. Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\r\nOverall: 7.7/10.\n"
