Specifically, there are two major sides that you have to side with no matter what. Welcome to the Annie vs. Mikasa debate.\r\nAnd with no stretching up, both characters have their ups and downs. Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls made a huge contribution to this debate while it focuses on Mikasa and Annie on a deeper scale, presenting more information on their past and rendering them as human beingswith their own dreams, motivations, and fears.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nSpanning 3 episodes, Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls dedicates the first two for Annie, a character that we haven't seen much of, especially on the last seasons (2 and 3 as of now), which was a total let down. The one shot takes place the day before her exposal for the titan she is, peaking on her daily routine, and it just happens to be an interesting case where she has to look for some rich man's missing daughter. They did a great job not only showing the soft and actual human part of Annie but also gave us a glimpse of the thug life on the lawless streets of Wall Maria. It seems the world inside is even more corrupt and rotten than the other side of the walls, and having a fragile girl (as she referred to herself while fighting Eren on some training flashback) take over a case that would normally exceed the qualities of a rookie such as herself puts her at a real-world challenge, both morally and faithfully. The two first episodes flow nicely and fast until you realize you already made it to the third and last episode, which is centered about Mikasa as she pictures what it would have been like if her mother and father weren't assassinated, would she still have met Eren? would they still be that close of friends? It was a bit messy and complicated if you don't pay enough attention as they timeline conflicts can really confuse you, I didn't sign up for Steins;Gate class complicated shows, but I was shocked nevertheless.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nThe animation in Attack on Titan was always a core key, and a great one might I add. Everybody would go praising how fluid and fantastic the visuals are, but honestly, not so much with this one. And I can excuse that for there were minimal action scenes to focus on. The art style was normal, but well maintained and consistent throughout the OVA, never lazy or blunt. I would argue that the \u201cNo Regrets\u201d OVA had better flexing on the animation, but that's another talk for another day. But don't give up, the two or three satisfying punches do take a thing or two from that glorious cake of an animation.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nI really appreciate their choice of ending theme songs, the first two, there was an original ending song with both visuals and sound, focusing of course on Annie and her outsider friends. But what really added nostalgia to the mix was the return of the fantastic ending theme song of Mikasa from the first season of the parent series. The voice acting was great, again, Attack On Titan's cast was always great on this one. Unfortunately, there wasn't any opening theme song to start off the hype, but it isn't always necessary.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThis is what kept the OVA going, Annie had some great focus, the spotlight brought out the best out of her and gave us some deep insight into her life, and some sneaky peaks on her backstory. Before this, I really didn't give Annie many credits and wasn't even one of my top favorite characters in the series, but this was a rank-changer for her to me. Unfortunately, Mikasa's episode wasn't as deep as Annies, it didn't add anything special, to be honest, we already knew plenty about her, she only seemed to display even more affection to Eren.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nMost definitely, my second favorite OVA of the series after \u201cNo Regrets\u201d, I enjoyed the heck out of what Annie had to offer, but not much with Mikasa's. There are in fact few intriguing moments with Mikasa, making her as sort of having some mysterious supernatural powers, they did it before and here they are back with it strong.\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\r\nIf you're either of both characters fan (which you should be), you should give this a try, especially for you Annie lovers, it's for her, more than a just irrelevant episode because they manage to tell more about her than the entire series did so far.\n"
