It's been 17 years since that one series impacted its fans, and after what looked like an eternity, out of nowhere struck the news of getting two new adaptations. The first episode of FLCL Alternative was aired on April the 1st making a pleasant intro to remember. However, all the hype started dying after the disappointment FLCL Progressive was badly received by the fans of the original, and thus making the next upcoming entry (FLCL Alternative) in the same expectancy as well. Surprise surprise, it did better, no, I did amazingly better that Imight go as far as putting it above the original on some respect, and a lot of people disagree with me on the simple fact that it didn't start fully faithful to the core message of FLCL. And dare I say, FLCL Alternative did, in fact, embrace the same idea of FLCL but in a different way and perspective, it added some extra seasoning and made the FLCL of its own.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nA big commotion starter is how a new thing breaks the traditional way of doing a particular thing. Such is the way the two new adaptations of FLCL are in. FLCL Alternative on the other hand broke that convention and had it the other way despite what one can say, and it actually was great.\r\nMore than ever, the hidden message is no more, instead, it's presented very clear and bright, only a lacking person would miss on it. FLCL was always about growing up, and FLCL Alternative was no stranger to the idea, only had a different take on its execution.\r\nThe definition of growing up here was that things must change at some point, a student will no longer remain a student, and will have to move on to handling more complicated responsibilities than just studying. Takkun had it in FLCL, being extremely young and almost out of middle school, so naive and strange to anything grown up. FLCL Alternative stepped it up a bit, and had highschoolers going against themselves between going edgy and following an acceptable path in life, probably the hardest turn point on one's life.\r\nFriendship was a great player in spicing up controversy, having grown with a select group of people and then parting with them due to personal dreams can either shake things up or ease them. Growing up only becomes more and more clear the more you move on, and it turned up it was never a choice. Seeing adults doing adult stuff can have a lot of depth behind it, much like eating spicy food and have little to no annoyance while doing it doesn't make you a mature person, you can still eat it while enduring its spiciness or bitterness for the sole purpose of survival. It's doesn't always go your way, that was what FLCL Alternative was going for.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nImagine the abstractness of FLCL mixed with the more modern and refined technics of mainstream animation that does a better than imagined job at keeping it as FLCL as possible without throwing any turn-offs, unless you're just complaining because you were against the idea of a new take on the franchise.\r\nI'd say, the original still holds up pretty well to even score next to movie-class animations, and while FLCL Alternative doesn't go that far it still puts the rest seasonal fellows faced to a shameful corner. Aside from a minor sighting of above average CGI use, it was visually almost a full-fledged FLCL experience.\r\nOne thing I think FLCL Alternative did better though is the character design, although Haruto is still noticeably Haruko, you can't help but feel a sense of modern touch on especially her face, something about it that makes her more like a human than the alien she is.\r\nI really loved the explosion and particle effects overall, so detailed and fluid it made all the intense parts Michael-Bay-worthy.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nThe pillows did it again, never this happy to hear a familiar drop before, so nostalgic and fitting it just never gets old.\r\nAgain, no opening theme song introduced, which is perfectly fine, with FLCL the soundtracks make up for almost any mistake (No chance Progressive, no chance today). The ending theme song was just great, it suited the theme this season was going after, growing up, a very relatable topic that your ear would swear on its quality.\r\nI first experienced FLCL in its subbed form and was not exposed to the dubbed version until I gave FLCL Progressive a chance which was horrible at first (Haruko's voice was a pass for me), but it kind of gave me the initial push that had me at home with the dubbed version of FLCL Alternative, Haruko's tone had already become easier to listen to and the new cast was really amazing.\n\r\n- Character (9.5/10):\r\nMost differently, FLCL Alternative nailed its characters even more than the two previous installments did. With the series giving focus on more than just one, it never neglected the others and had them affect the story just as much. For a change, the friendly quadruples had troubles and personal issues to tend to after facing the other way from each other, it really made it feel like a shared story. A lot of slice of life aura was felt due to this, and as different as FLCL Alternative was, it really did it justice in a way.\r\nI for one found myself invested in all of those characters, I tore for them, laughed for them, and was with them till the end, all likable and offer a variety of impact on the story.\r\nThe most controversial part here was Haruko, a lot of people were turned down by the new big sister that gives advice and cares for other people, it was no longer the selfish backstabber we all grew up knowing, which in my book was a nice take from FLCL Alternative, sometimes changing the trend helps to refresh the genre.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nRight after watching the first episode I knew what I was signing up for.\r\nIn my opinion, out of the three installments, this one was the greatest, between the original whacky and loved FLCL, and the modern and badly received FLCL Progressive, FLCL Alternative took the perfect foot in between and provided the best out of both takes, it's a lot more easier to grasp than both as well, the core message it kind of painfully obvious since the first half, but it wasn't any less fun.\r\nI enjoyed the different side stories it provided a lot more so that I would pay for an extended slice of life of these individual characters, it kept consistent throughout its 6 episodes.\n\r\n- Overall (8.8/10):\r\nOne thing that you should really step in with, is an open mind, and the rest will be a short begged for enjoyment.\r\nBashing on how it's different is only a turn down that easily blindfolds the fans from experiencing a take they never asked for but would greatly appreciate otherwise.\r\nAnother side note would be, watching this before you see the first two installments won't make much of a fuss as prior knowledge of previous happenings won't take away much. In fact, it would be a great and different experience watching them all in reverse.\n"
