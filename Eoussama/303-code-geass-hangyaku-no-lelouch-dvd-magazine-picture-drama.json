There goes my sanity again.\n\r\nCode Geass is a weird one for me, first and for most, my favorite Anime, but oh God, do I hate its guts the second I watch related Picture Drama, and this time was no different. As if finding them in the first place wasn't hard enough of a task that you would expect being rewarded for only to be wooshed off in the lamest and lazy way.\n\r\nSeriously, once you've seen one, you've seen them all, but they just keep coming and I just can't keep away.\n              "
