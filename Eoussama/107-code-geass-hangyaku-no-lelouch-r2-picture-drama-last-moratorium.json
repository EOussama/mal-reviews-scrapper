    "content": "\n                Another one of those picture dramas, and when you've seen a couple, you start feeling like you've seen them all, and it's not the case, at least, not with Code Geass.\r\nCode Geass's approach to picture dramas has always focused on the group of Milly Ashford students, doing silly things and goofing around. None of them has ever asked for the life they've gotten themselves involved in, it was always around being together and doing fun stuff.\r\nOne side note to keep in mind is that there are no subbed version of this short, none that I'm aware of, and I've done extensive research to find somebut turned up disappointed.\n"
