I would constantly see people praising the hell out of it, and then reflect on myself, should I give it another chance? Yeah, maybe I should, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it when I first watched it, and thus, was the reason I never enjoyed it. A big no-no is what you get sir, this couple of OVAs reminded me on why I reallyfeel disgusted towards the show, why I think it should have never existed in the first place. Keep in mind that these couple of episodes are spoiler free, the first episode takes place after the second episode of the parent series, and the second one after the fourth episode of the parent series.\n\r\n- Story (2/10):\r\nYou know how crappy OVAs can be, but not all of them are this bad.\r\nAs if the wackiness of the parent series wasn't enough, they for so long explaining on how they all died for the sake of some dream and all, while in the same breath exploit their ability to be resurrected just to that they can put them to rest a moment later. I hated this approach of storytelling and making up excuses for bad and contradicting fourth wall breaking jokes. The story could stand out for a decent comedy if we were to remove all of the pointless death sentences and the wanna-be-sad attempts, it feels like that teenager that's confused on what to do and just want to sort their problems out, but can never decide on the right choices.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nIt's fine I guess, the art style, in general, feels very modern and holds up to this day, but what I really appreciate is the fuild animation on the fast-paced action moment, I really like the backgrounds, digital they may be, but they really look like a treasure mine for some Tumblr class wallpapers.\n\r\n- Sound (6/10):\r\nEnough to keep up with the direction of the animation, the voice acting isn't the best, but the opening and ending theme songs are one of the finest. The soundtrack was very hard to notice if there was one at all, but probably that was because of the distracting character cast that all jump into the screen, fighting desperately for a spotlight.\n\r\n- Characters (0/10):\r\nAbsolutely ridiculous, none of them make for a memorable figure. They go a long road calling the extras NPCs while they couldn't be more of hypocrites themselves, in fact, they were the NPCs with the horrible AI from a shitty Ubisoft game. For one, the main character doesn't look like a main, not in appearance not in his acts, in fact, some side characters do make up for better mains than himself.\r\nAll of the characters are just that boring with nothing to add but a desperate comic relief source, and they call it a sad show? They are nothing but a brutal punching bag for whenever they decide to murder somebody on screen for the heck of it, and did I mention that it makes up for 90% of every episode? No? Well, get this, Manhunt would be put to shame.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (2/10):\r\nI mainly enjoyed this for being an average refreshed on the direction of the show. It's been a long time since I last watched the parent series, and this special reminded me why I avoided rewatching it. This mediocre (at the very best) overrated piece of work that some people call a masterpiece was just an excuse to continuously kill off characters for the sake of amusement, how sadistic is that? I guess if there were people fetishizing on feet and sneezing, this wouldn't sound like an act weirdness. What a time to be alive.\n\r\n- Overall (3.5/10):\r\nI still feel like I was being generous with this review in favor of this OVA, I do not enjoy a similar lazy story direction, and I'm sure there are people who strongly disagree, I'm not going to call you off because of a show you like, everyone has their taste they think very high of, if you enjoy this genre, good for you, you might have found yet another show to binge, but as for me, this entire franchise is better off disposed off. Probably the trashiest work of Jun Maeda, and he's had some top tier stories under his name.\n"
