However, once a few years comes the deal breaker, that one Shounen that claims the genre in its name, but tackles things differently that one can easily mistake it for a more mature toned series that would best fit the Seinen criteria. Enter, Shounen Jump's highly praisedtitle, \u201cYakusoku no Neverland\u201d, or \u201cThe promised Neverland\u201d as a direct translation.\n\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nHaving lived every day as perfect and full of smiles as ever, eating healthy meals and playing tag on a lovely green field. Just when they least expected it, the kids at this charming and happy orphanage come into the realization that flipped their lives upside down like they never expected before, their fragile mentality naturally rampaged into devastating cries but before long, their instinct of survival awakened, and it was time for the longest game of tag in the history where winning is the only way to survival.\n\r\nProbably what kills a good adaptation is the factor of time, that fear of catching up to the source material haunts the people involved in a production level more than anyone making them steep so low to utilize stalling techniques from what ranges from filler content to dragging scenes more than they should, all as a strategic move that benefits the franchise in a business level. Being a seasonal Anime alone speaks of its quality, and that's not even referencing the studio behind it, Bones has delivered some of the greatest adaptations and \u201cThe promised Neverland\u201d is no exception.\r\nWith as much crapped up content as a seasonal production allows, fast yet cautious pacing really helps speed up through only what matters making you never yawn in boredom.\n\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nIf there was anything this adaptation does exceptionally more than anything else, is the camera positioning, no kidding, the cinematography team must have been filled with world-class talented individuals, you could have never thought how a simple movement from a camera can enhance even a still image and build suspense in unimaginable ways.\n\r\nThe art style one everything but familiar, and you can take that any way you want, but a change is never immediately bad. The character's facial features surely are odd and can be uncanny to some, having all of their features extremely centered in their face, pointy noses and neighboring eyes, well, it's animations, and an artist can take all the freedom in his or her canvas.\n\r\nOne other thing that a lot of shows lack is consistency in delivering the same visual quality, something that's very easy to slack up on. The love people put in their work is apparent, and this was no different.\n\n\r\nSound (9.5/10):\r\nVoice acting is key.\r\nIn a show that's this heavy on drama, a single syllable off can ruin an important performance, making the audience feel bad for a character can be regarded as a form of talent, it is no easy task to decide if someone should be crying or having a watery eye simply by utilizing your voice in such a way that provokes the tears, that's a magical power that we tend to sleep on usually.\r\nThe voice acting cast is a solid one, nailing every emotional scene be it in favor of sadness or joy, their tone can move you like an unworldly spell.\n\r\nLet's talk opening and ending sequence. They have already secured a definitive spot on those popular Youtube Anime songs quizzes, maybe even on a few fans' playlists, I know I got them in there.\n\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI'm not going to praise \u201cYakusoku no Neverland\u201d all that much on this one, it's got a good selection of interesting characters, and that's that.\r\nI can appreciate a well-written character that doesn't fall under your typical trashy tropes the like of a stupid big-breasted chick or a smart loli first-grader otaku head, all of the characters are portrayed in a realistic manner that makes it easier to relate to.\r\nBeing the orphanage it takes place at, it's bound to flood you with all sorts of characters that give you a hard time to remember all of their names and matching faces, but that was not the case here, they all get their respective highlights were they got some spotlights to shine unlike most of other Shounen.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThis season had some great shows that keep you begging for the next episode, so it's hard to honestly measure the hype related to this specific show but it's there. A lot of fans of the Manga praised this adaptation and what it had coming and they were right.\r\nThe cliff hangers were crazy, the build-up on every episode was almost flawless and involving, there was a great room for theorizing and feeding the community back of whatever chunk of lore you've managed to knit a theory out of.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nIs it a recommendation? Well, is that even a question, most definitely it is. I don't care if you're not on good terms with Shounen Anime, this could be the change you sought for so long, it's so different from other Shounen that it might fool you to think otherwise.\r\nI can already estimate the massive amount of fans jumping straight to reading the Manga for how excited they are to know more, and I could be on the same horde. That's just how good \u201cYakusoku no Neverland\u201d was, and you bet your boy is going to suck on the second season as well.\n"
