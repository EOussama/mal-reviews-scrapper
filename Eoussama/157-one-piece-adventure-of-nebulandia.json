    "content": "\n                With a much popular as series One Piece is, almost annually, we get all sorts of specials episodes, movies, and more, and for the most part, they tend to fall under the same reoccurring reflective plot, that goes as the Straw Hats visit a new island, then befriend the resident, and help defeat the baddies, and that's pretty much it. However, this special in particular has come up with something we don't usually see much anymore in One Piece, an element of storytelling very underrated, that we've only seen from once before, back at the formidable G8 filler arc.\r\nIt's that outstanding sense of danger thatdoesn't come from a brawn, but rather, brains this time, as we get to see the Straw Hats get overwhelmed by a seemingly superior tactical genius, getting taken down with clever decision making one by one until they realize their situation and overcome it.\r\nThe general visual production was nice, better than your average weekly releases of course, but not as soothing as a big budget movie product.\r\nThe edges were shart, the anatomy looked great, and the movement was decently fluid.\r\nCharacter-wise, this was a shocker for me. A character I never liked but never disliked either has managed to level up in my eyes like I never expected. Remember the busted Foxy? From the Davy Back fight arc, yes, he makes a come back, and this time, as a dependable ally, something I never asked for, but surprisingly welcomed with open arms.\r\nWe get to see more of him as a captain for his crew, his dynamic and the respect his crew hold towards him, it was precious.\n"
