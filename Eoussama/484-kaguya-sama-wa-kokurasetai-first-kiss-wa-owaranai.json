As a devoted fan of the series, I couldn't have asked for a better continuation of the story. The movie captured all the elements that make Kaguya-sama so special: comedy, romance, and a sprinkle of heartfelt moments.\n\r\nOne thing that stood out was the animation quality and art, which was top-notch. The characters' expressions and exaggerated reactions brought extra humor to the already funny scenes. Additionally, seeing the Ice Kaguya arc come to life was a treat, and the added touches of Chibi Kaguya and Ice Kaguya provided insightinto Kaguya's complex character.\n\r\nThe movie took us on an emotional rollercoaster, with Kaguya and Miyuki both wrestling with their insecurities and fear of rejection. It was refreshing to see their character growth, and their eventual confession and relationship development felt satisfying and heartwarming.\n\r\nHowever, while the movie was amazing, it was a bit bittersweet to see certain aspects not included. For instance, the absence of the Ishigami Christmas party and some condensed standalone chapters left me yearning for more. But I understand the constraints of adapting a manga into a movie and appreciate what was brought to the screen.\n\r\nThe humor was on point, with hilarious scenes that had the entire theater bursting into laughter. The chemistry between the characters, especially Kaguya and Miyuki, shone brightly, and their interactions were a joy to watch.\n\r\nIn terms of score, I'd rate the movie a solid 8.06/10. It was an excellent continuation of the story, and the beautiful ending gave us a sense of closure while leaving room for more adventures in the future. I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing what's next for our favorite characters, and I trust that the series will continue to captivate its audience.\n"
