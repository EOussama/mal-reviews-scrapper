Nobody wants anything to do with a bloodstained slave, somebody whose hands went greasy with all the oily bombshells they keep feeding those overused canons, a hand that's split numerous throat is something nobody wants to willingly shake nor meet its master.\n\r\nMuch like your old shoes, you either give them to somebody else to use until they completely wear off, or you throw them at the bottom of a trash can to rot with not a single sweat. But what if the orphan was given a chance in a world he/she never knew existed, aside from the smoky and dark skies, intoxicated with the deadly chemical poisons that are regarded as the work of the devil even in the most horrifying of wars, his/her young eyes never have seen. A rainbow enveloping the open blue sky at the end of every other rainy day must be nothing other than a magical myth for his/her imagination that idolized explosions and their colorful sight. For someone, who's been raised and disciplined by a strict military hand wouldn't understand why those other kids of his/her age are doing that weird expression of their face that has them stretch their mouths in a strange way across their faces with a mysterious eye squeeze while holding a grown up's hand. \u201cThat must be his master\u201d, the orphan wonders.\n\r\nClearly, stepping into a territory populated with these alien ideas must be unimaginably hard to adapt to, going nuts for not receiving any orders in a while would have drug effect-like syndromes. Converting your whole lifestyle is never easy, and so is writing down an honest letter.\n\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nIn a suspiciously Europe like land stuck in an era of conflicts, a child embodies the orphan spoken about earlier, bearing the name \u201cViolet\u201d has finally wrapped a huge chapter of her life and is forcibly introduced to a world she never asked to be in, a world where birds replaced the bullet lullaby she's grown used to in her time in the military. Flowers and vegetation took the place of minded fields, and those seemingly fallen soldiers on the ground are all somehow as lifely as one can get.\n\r\nThe narrative follows that girl Violet in her journey of converting from a war weapon to exactly the opposite of what she used to be, those stained hands that have ripped many hearts straight from their bodies are now writing letters that help carry many people's emotion to the individual they need to reach. As she accepts this duty as just another mission for an order-begging tool as what everybody used to call her in the military, she grows to be more of a human than ever.\n\r\nViolet Evergarden did a lot of things splendidly, but it was worth noting its bearable slow-paced plot that wasn't really a problem but it needed to be pointed out. As it follows Violet as an individual, it also packs up a lot of other self-contained stories that help Violet in reaching her goal while also introducing other people and expands on their problems and suffering.\r\nAnd those were all easily relatable and simple enough for everybody to follow, from a dying mother to a grieving father, all of those distant childhood friends and those famous war love stories, a million words worth of feeling can magically be put into a single piece of paper and wrapped in an envelope shaping a meaningful letter.\n\r\nWhile some stories were tear-jerking and really stand out solidly as their own self-contained arc, a handful others were kind of meh, there was a great attempt in delivering the feels that you'd expect from a show like this, but it gets over dramatic very easily it kind of gets predictable and tiring.\r\nThe concept that the story comes with however is very intriguing, while at that conflict fueled era, not a lot of educated people were crawling the streets, especially with a high dead bar as that, so a group of women with an impressive literature background and a solid number of vocabulary offers a variety of ghostwriting services, with a flashy title that spells \u201cAuto Memoir Doll Service\u201d, it encapsulates Violet especially very good with her Doll looking appearance and even contracts what she used to be viewed us, nothing more than a heartless mannequin.\n\n\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nIt's definitely something you don't see every day. At least visually speaking, Violet Evergarden stands very high on the scale. It does everything write on the visual level. And most of that is achieved mainly by its breathtaking artwork and the scalable art style.\n\r\nA lot of people call it the best-animated Anime ever, but that's where they are wrong. First and before anything. Animation is not artwork, and it's the latter what Violet Evergarden excels at. Fluid animation is something you would pair shows like Shingeki no Kyojin, One Punch Man, Space Dandy with, it's all on those lively frames, the camera movements, everything about the cinematography. But Violet masters something else, something that's neglected most of the time and only famous among big movie production, something I like to call the art of still images.\n\r\nThere is a certain beauty in every frame, you're guaranteed to take a high-quality wallpaper worthy screenshot whenever you pause the episode you're watching. I could stare at still shots from the show for a long time and there is immense satisfaction and enjoyment in doing solely that, I always find myself complaining about major flaws in character anatomy and weird facial expressions, but never with Violet Evergarden, it is certainly the best treat my eye has received consistency wise. Not even a single episode fell short on delivering the same level of quality, even movies seem to lower that at some parts. If this show was a cake, it would have been the tastiest my eyes have ever eaten.\n\r\nIt feels really weird when I have to put this into words, one obvious reason would be in my inferior writing skills compared to a world-renowned writer like Violet herself, but it makes you beg for more content so simple as another casual introduction, as she leans forward bowing her head, and the fresh breeze blows lightly her hair and every portion of the grassy ground starts dancing along with the complimentary blow of air.\r\nEven the way shiny surfaces reflect their environment or how a fallen leaf can bright so much life and peacefulness when it distorts a still and calm lake, it makes you want to leave your house and drive somewhere similar where you can appreciate nature as you please.\n\r\nThere is also the excellent alternation between bright and dark colors as they are utilized to highlight the current tone of the plot, as, of course, in the battlefield, it's all gloomy and down looking, most of the time pretty dark and horrifying, but as soon as they tone shifts off, it's suddenly all colorful and happy all around, and their pretty eyes portray that perfectly.\n\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nTalking media-wise, a sound stream is a judge between a bundle of animated frames being either a GIF or a video, while looking at a beach scene, however beautiful it may be, it wouldn't come close to an alteration of itself with a fitting collection of sound to accompany those waves.\r\nViolet Evergarden isn't just visually phenomenal, it's also vocally near that level.\n\r\nFor me at least, I wouldn't have been able to come up with a better voice acting cast to carry on this trippy journey, it needs something that standouts, this is a story that requires a handful effort to deliver the heartbreaking dialog and eye beating facial expressions and it feels that Violet Evergarden the show has been blessed with a cutting edge vocal performance of a high production value. That concerns even the most irrelevant spoken character to Violet herself (Voiced by Ishikawa Yui that also did Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin).\n\r\nDon't be surprised if you ever noticed that this show's opening and ending theme songs always make it in those popular Anime opening quizzes videos because God do they stand up.\r\nThe opening sequence starts up slowly with a delicate voice that feels like a narrator of its own story portrayed by the opening's visuals, but it's debatable whether or not it contains spoilers, it definitely prepares you mentally for the rollercoaster content in the said episode.\r\nThe end sequence is just as good, while not every episode ends on a sad notice, the ending song does worsen the mood in a good way as it only reminds you to have some more tissues ready for the next episode.\n\r\nThe soundtrack collections was just so good, it has a slight Victorian vibe to it and it works amazingly with the mood of the story, although, sometimes the music choice of certain moments wasn't the best, not that the show was lacking in fitting tracks it was just the bad timing and horrible pair between an animated scene and a soundtrack that did the scene more damage than refinement.\n\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\r\nIf there was anything Violet Evergarden lacked, it was a more interesting character cast. I'll cut the show some slack for being an episodic narration of a bigger story that most of the time involves one-time characters that we are likely to never hear from or seen ever again, but that doesn't cover the main cast, the ones that steer the series and contribute to its progression.\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Violet has had great character development, seeing her start off from scratch like a newborn baby, it made it easy to see Violet reaching a new level of enlightenment, it's always those small details, like seeing Violet spare some genuin sad tears or crack a wide smile, it felt like hitting a milestone and gives off that warm motherly feeling. You get to see her grow from more than a spectator's view.\n\r\nAside from Violet, other supporting characters have had their moments with some even having their standalone focused episodes, but what about the rest? There were a lot of great opportunities to elaboration on some love interests between other characters, some even had that protagonist look that teases you to ask for more, but you only get left off at the end with no appreciated delivery.\n\r\nThe show did a decent job when it came to the \u201cbad guy\u201d. It was never about a bad dude with a long cloak and a dramatic evil laugh, it felt more like Violet going against her past, even the supposedly bad people become more approachable and likable as the plot pealed their top skin and gave them more context, it really was a story about one girl as the show's title suggests, but it still carried on all of those side stories nevertheless.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nMy experience with Violet Evergarden could have been very different given the pace I'd take, and I believe, one's enjoyment would really vary given how they decide to watch it, go full out in one sit binging every episode like there's no tomorrow, or watching every episode individually with a break in between every episode. I went with the latter and I'm glad I did.\r\nI do believe an episode a day or every three days would be the ideal approach of watching the series as it differs a lot from most shows. It follows a strict episodic pattern, every episode is self-contained and tackles its own pace, so no need to rush in there.\n\r\nSometimes after completing an episode, you're just that invested with all of the displayed emotions, you just want to take it easy and have a break, reflect on the episode, take a deeper dive into the concepts it involves and think about all sorts of conclusions, it really helps connect with the mini-stories and characters a lot better, and also lightens the strains on your eyes, if you're easy to drop tears, don't be harsh on yourself, make yourself a favor and take your time.\n\r\nI feel like I need to express more on how amazing the visuals were, to me, that's a pretty high ceiling to be the ruler for my reviews from now on. The voice acting is sharp and on point, the pacing is a bit slow and very bearable given the eye candy that fills your screen. It's not the best re-watch worthy show out there, I'm sure it would be some time until I decide to re-watch this again, sometimes when I had forgotten most of the plot, it's never as good as when you first experience it that's for sure.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.3/10):\r\nViolet Evergarden is a great show, I wouldn't go as far as most people and call it a masterpiece, as it still has some minor flaws that could have been easily avoided, but it stands out on top of many other shows in some areas even being scored lower than them in general.\n\r\nIf you're expecting romance, you'll be left disappointed, it does tackle concepts like love, but the story's primary message was never about that.\r\nIf you do enjoy redemption stories, starting off fresh and aiming for the top, I'd highly recommend you clear out a spot every once in a while with at least two tissues next to you and a backup for last resort. Make sure however you don't watch it all in one take, it really takes off a lot from the experience, as the more you reflect on a mini-story, the more it grows on you.\n"
