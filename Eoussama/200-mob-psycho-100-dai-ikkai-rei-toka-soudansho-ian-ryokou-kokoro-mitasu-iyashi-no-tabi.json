Of course, that applies to all of those BAD shows that you are just forced to finish out of your completionist habit. But then again, there are always the shows that have you asking for more, even when they are finished, so as soon as extra content is released, you're already carving a sit through. That is of course very common with sequels and whatnot. But short animations are almost always a grind. They either have a doll anduncompelling setting, used as a cash grab marketing move, or in some rare instances like this one, is a love letter to the fans, a thank you statement appreciated only by the devoted fans that always ask for extra.\n\r\n\u201cMob Psycho 100: Dai Ikkai Rei toka Soudansho Ian Ryokou - Kokoro Mitasu Iyashi no Tabi\u201d is a self-contained story, set some time after the evens of the second season of the parent show \u201cMob Psycho 100\u201d, following Shigeo, Reigen, Ritsu, Teruki, Ekubo, and Katsuya as they head  expecting a relaxing hot spring vacation only to be involved into yet another odd Job of Reigen's expertise.\n\r\nWhat sells the OVA is how modular it is, it could easily be bundled with the second season as a sequential episode with none noticing a drop of pacing, animation, voice acting or quality, it has been clearly given the same amount of love and care the parent series got. It was truly an enjoyable watch that had the same lovable characters, used the same familiar landmark humor, welcomed back the fans, and opens its arms to the strange. All in short. Watch it!\n"
