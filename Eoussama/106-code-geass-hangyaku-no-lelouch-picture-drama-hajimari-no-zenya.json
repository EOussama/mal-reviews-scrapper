    "content": "\n                An actually 3 minutes short that managed to have something going on for it, this is a first for me, a definitive welcomed one.\r\nI really appreciated the fact that they managed to patch up a famous so-called \u201cplot hole\u201d, like \u201cHow did Lelouch know how to pilot a Knightmare?\u201d, well, it seems he's always had a secret simulator for that.\r\nIt all revolved around Lelouch quitting his Knightmare simulation session while thinking intensely what his next move would be, this looked like it might have been set before the start of the series, he was just considering running away from Britannia and taking Nannualy with him.Good prologue material.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nNot a very popular opinion, but the retro-card look of this was really good. It lacks fluid motion of course, but what good would that do this type of animation approach? It looked like any typical Picture Drama, manga panels being breath life upon.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI really liked the intensity on this, as Lelouch continued diving into what moves he should be considering, his tone of voice changed intensity as well and that was only highlighted by the phenomenal matching soundtrack in the back, really remarkable.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nNot so good on the experience, however still provided something better than nothing.\n\r\n- Overall (7/10):\r\nI would say it works really good as a prologue, and would differently recommend it for newcomers to sort of lay the foundation of what to expect, it's very light on spoilers, in fact, doesn't have any at all, making it a near perfect candidate as a first exposure to the series.\n"
