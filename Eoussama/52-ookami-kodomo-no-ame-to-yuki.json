In the midst of pills of different picks that consist of all sorts of genres that mostly span as action or fantasy titles are found as glowing gems in the floor of the ocean, could this one be a legit gem? we shall see.\r\n\u201cOokami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki\u201d, or \u201cWold Children\u201d isa tale that might appear pale and predictable in comparace to others, but has a lot more to offer, its biggest focus is treasuring family bonds no matter the hardships. And it's nice to catch a fresh breath once in a while.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nOn the surface, Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki's plot feels very predictable and not too relatable, after all, not all of us went through the same things as the portrayed characters, and yet, the story stands out surprisingly very well and feels different, not like any other. The execution was key, the calm progression pace was the lead here. Although the story focused on a slice of a select character's life that averages about 12 to 13 years, nothing felt rushed.\r\nMeet Hana, a 19 years old hardworking college student that one day meets this charming werewolf and fell in love with him. Shortly after they had two babies that both were born as werewolves too, and the story picks up from there. Hana, a girl so young suddenly was exposed to this massive harsh world with people to take care of leaving behind all of her dreams to make her abnormal children happy without risking exposing their truth to other people.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nImagine having to take a bite out of the most [insert your favorite fruit here], now Imaging you can actually taste it with your eyes, that would be the feeling you get when looking at this beautiful artwork.\r\nThe art style, like how non-CG, character faces are drawn looks very chunky and uninteresting, but it was the colors and the work that went to blend everything up together with those yet amazing lively interactive background what made it stand out to be its own thing.\r\nThis movie takes place around rural areas, for the most part, so the production team unleashed their creativity and depicted one of the most eye ammuzing drawn/animation vegetation and environment, the way leaves and grass dance with the wind and everything, just Ughh.\r\nThey also went crazy with the details in pretty much everywhere you look, the slightest raindrop has a character to it, accurately sliding properly on the given surface it lands on, and let's how to ignore how well done was those umbrellas being torn in the midst of storms. Absolutely, a sweet, sweet eye candy.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThe deal with Japanese Anime is, most of the time, wrong character voice acting is done either bad, or is just unfitting for certain characters, like how an adult or even an old lady would still have a voice that of a child, I paid extra attention to this in this movie, trying to see how distinguishable were the voices of the mother, a young adult, and her toddler kid girl. And I got to say, they knew what they were doing, the voices just fit the faces they were vocing for flawlessly, the elderly had that stuttering tone to their voice, and you could capture the clumsiness and cuteness in the kid's voices as well. Adults sounded very mature and natural on all sorts of emotions making them more believable.\r\nThe soundtracks deserve a praise of their own too, the right music hit my eardrums at the right times, portraying their intended emotions very well, and the selection of the records was great as well.\n\r\n- Character (9.8/10):\r\nThis is how character developement should be, it's almost been redefined by this exact definition.\r\nThroughout the plot progression, you get to see the change in all of the characters, how all their experiences affect them for the better, or the worse. All characters had good motives for what they do, all of them were acting realistically and relatable as well, like the little kid, Ame being so lonely and with no friends that kept complaining about how human hate wolves because he noticed how evil wolves are written in children's tales, you really get to see how they make good, no, great use of the world building here.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10.0/10):\r\nThis was one of those animations that never let me drop focus or interest in continuing watching, I never asked myself what time it was, or how much is it for the movie to finish, I just sat down expecting a clich\u00e9 story, and got more than I bargained for. This one of those movies that I ought to re-watch at least every 2 years or so with friends and family, and deffinetely recommend on so many occasions.\n\r\n- Overall (9.0/10):\r\nIf you're still questioning whether you should give this one a chance then rest assured, there's nothing top working about, this is a very wholesome family-friendly movie, with some mature content to it, like a makeout between a human and a wolf a the beginning, and even a nipple slip later on, unless you're fine with that, you have such a great story to see.\n"
