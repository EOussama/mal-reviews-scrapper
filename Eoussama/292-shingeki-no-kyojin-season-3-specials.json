    "content": "\n                If you've made it this far to AoT's specials, you already know of the infamous and overslept Chibi shorts that parody all sorts of happenings from the parent show, mocks the characters, and cracks dark jokes that feel too close to home.\n\r\nI think unless you're a completionist that wants to see everything there is or a fanatic AoT stan that just has to go through everything, you're probably not going to ever watch this, however, in both cases, nothing special might come out of this. The humor is very straight forward and 1 dimensional, even doll at times. It tries too hard to make somethingout of every scene it parodies, but at the end of the day, it's just another special to distribute along side the Blu-Ray release.\n"
