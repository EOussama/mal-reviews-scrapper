I mean, who wouldn't want to relive all the Titan-slaying action in just 15 minutes? But then I watched it and...let's just say, I was left feeling like I just got off the world's shortest rollercoaster.\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it was still cool to see all my favorite characters in one place, but it was just too fast! I mean, I knew that Season 3 wasintense, but I didn't realize just how intense until I saw it all condensed into 15 minutes.\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for a quick fix of \"Shingeki no Kyojin\" action, then this recap video is perfect for you! But if you want to really immerse yourself in the world of Titans, then you'll have to sit down for the full ride. After all, sometimes it's the journey that counts, not just the destination. You'd just think could they have made it be a better recap instead.\n"
