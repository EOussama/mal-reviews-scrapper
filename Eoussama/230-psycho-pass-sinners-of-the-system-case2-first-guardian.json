When it came back to it, I sighed. Good, it's only an hour-long, let's do this. But Oh boy was I lowering my guard way too much sarcastically.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nVery different from the first SS case movie, even in tone, it shifts its attention to more action, but actually nails it on the fingers just right enough for you toenjoy, even though, the beauty of the original was all in the subtle strategic 4D chess war between the inspectors and the suspects. At the very core, this movie was a war story, centering around the past of enforcer Teppei Sugou, handling our hands along his military days, past-forward to the prest day, a backstory I never thought I wanted until I was to sit through it.\r\nThe vibes of the movie Pearl Harbor were very thorough and strong, a beautiful friendship in the military, where one part goes missing in action and then assumed dead returns back to seek revenge and steer the action wheel.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nI might be going crazy, but I definitely think the animation team uped themselves in this one. A visual upgrade from the first SS case movie on every aspect, or perhaps, the much open and varying setting of this one helped deliver a better visual screening that the dark and gloomy closed mental facility of the first movie.\n\r\nSound (8.2/10):\r\nAgain with the vocal treatment. I just love the first opening and I really appreciate it being used yet again here. The featured ending song, however, was the second of the first season, which is also pretty amazing. More or less, the voice acting was just as on point in this movie, although I have to give more credit because, you know, Kougami, Kagari, and Masaoka. Yes, you know you gonna feel the excitement when each of them says as simple of a world as \u201cyes\u201d.\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\r\nWell well, I must say, this alone put this movie above the past one, and by miles.\r\nMasaoka received such a treatment, so glad that we got to see a movie-long screening of him, in a case that he took the golden flare in.\r\nVery surprising to see the past Ginoza though, I forgot how angry and Miku-like he was.\r\nAnd of course, Kougami and Kagari, man I just miss the OG team so much that I wish to forget all about this series and binge it again back to back.\r\nSugo received such a highlight during this one, I never personally cared much for him in the TV show, but now, he really shows so much growth from when he was still in the military and the resolution he came to at the end of the movie. The villain, however, was weak when it came to his motive, albeit, his and Sugo's friendship made up for the better part of the case.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI never expected anything to go past what the first movie set-up for, it seems, even in the past, there are exciting stories to tell in the franchise. I won't object to a similar treatment in the final movie.\n\r\nOverall (8.44/10):\r\nJust watch it, I'd even go as far as putting up with people for skipping the first movie just to see this one as eagerly as possible. It juts so purely good. Although it might be an unpopular opinion in the fandom, seeing that most people complained at the \u201cbad\u201d direction and how they don't like military stories, it manages to make a spin on that in my eyes, and to be frank, if not for the featuring of the OG team, the story is one that's mediocre at best and can have interchangeable events at any point and still won't make a difference.\n"
