I mean, what better way to market your cup noodles than to rope in two beloved characters from the massively popular Sword Art Online franchise and have them, of all things, sit down and enjoy a steaming bowl of your product? Genius! The added bonus of having the original Japanese voice actors record some new lines just takes the cake. I mean, who wouldn't want to hear Kirito and Alice wax poetic about the glories of instant noodles in their native tongue? The cherry on top has to be theinclusion of Chinese subtitles, as if the average Chinese consumer wouldn't already understand the dialogue. Bravo, He Wei Dao. Your marketing team is truly a visionary group.\n"
