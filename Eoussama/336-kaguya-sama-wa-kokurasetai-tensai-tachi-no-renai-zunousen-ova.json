    "content": "\n                If the first few seconds startled you that you had to check the website you're on, it's okay.\n\r\nAre we sure the animators did not mix up some commission papers here?\r\nThe first short story hit the wild boundaries pretty hard. Even for more ecchi shows.\n\r\nAside from the controversial short, the OVA stands strong as a classic Kaguya sitcom, it could have been included in any season and nothing would have felt off. The same jokes are cracked, but never boring, the intense monologuing is back, and of course, 7th wall breaking, at this point, me typing this review might be narrated by the narrator, and youreading this might be observed by Ishigami and Shirogane as well.\n"
