Thecolors looked washed off, very sticky to say, and not at all attractive. I don't remember the character designs to be this bland, but I guess they aged off pretty barely, even though I watch Boruto on a weekly basis and the art style shouldn't be that different.\n\r\nThe whole thing was very anti-climactic at the end as if the whole animation project was just to kick off a one-liner on how Naruto never gets to shine when people are present.\n"
