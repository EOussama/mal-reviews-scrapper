For a while now, countless fresh new shounen shows were striving to replace the old highly praised shows as the leading next-generation version (or just what Naruto tries to called its sequel; Boruto).\r\nIt's undeniable at this point that the Boku no Hero Academia is at the pinnacle of its growth, with two successful seasons, popular Manga, new upcoming games, feature movies, and I cankeep on going for long, this show is definitely a highlight for the new generation of anime. Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season continue the trend of its two previous seasons on being a seasonal show that doesn't fall short on delivering quality entertainment in all sorts of aspects, much like what Shingeki no Kyojin got us used to, crisp animation and phenomenal audio work were always a nice guy with open welcoming hands, doing a shounen feature justice for once.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nAnother season, another adventure. There is a lot to go through here, but let's just say, this season, in particular, was the most diverse in terms of story arcs, we get a field trip, an exam, an epic duel and more, what else could you ask for? This season managed to cover up the change of story in a great way, and yes, there was a great change in that respect, past this season, the world of Boku no Hero Academia is never the same, having villains cause much more pressure than before forced heroes all over the world to put into consideration plans they never accounted for. The heroes in training never thought the world could be this cruel.\r\nOne major flaw that bothered me was how linear and simplistic this season was, not entirely true for all arcs, but I could call on at least one that suffered the most from so much happening at the same time that it becomes a complete shitfest of an uninteresting mess.\r\nSeason two's tournament arc was spectacular, it made you appreciate how well and constructed the flow of events are in the story, but the tournament arc of this season was in compared to the previous one, very poorly written, it was all rushed and lazy that it felt like a filler arc.\n\r\n- Art (8.7/10):\r\nUnlike any other show, Boku no Hero Academia has a different feel to its animation, it's pretty average on parts that don't require any heavy animation works, like dialogue centered moments, flashbacks... But the battles, the battle speak for an entirely different manner. There is something to it, something that makes your muscles respond to whatever is being shown, Midoriya could be throwing one of his epic punches, and all your muscles would be mimicking it unintentionally, it all sounds very dynamic and bound to the limitless freedom of camera movements with the odd 3D-like angles.\r\nI kid you not when I say that a simple animation can put so much weight and emotions on each frame even if it was the most ordinary thing in combat, like a single punch, all it requires is moving a hand from point A to point B, and yet, Boku no Hero Academia pulls it off with the use of some unknown black magic that it smashes every bit of doubt and uncertainty.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThere hasn't been a single opening theme song that isn't included in the infamous \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d playlist on youtube, they are everywhere.\r\nBoku no Hero Academia 3rd Season makes a return with its amazing opening theme song picks, a couple of them this time around as well that remained as faithful to the quality we're used to.\r\nIf I had to choose, I'd say that this season was the greatest in terms of voice acting and soundtrack blending. One of the most emotional and epically intense moments of the series happens to take place here, and if the animation doesn't do the trick for you, the music, voice acting and everything related to audio can alone give you an experience out of this world that even a blind person would appreciate.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is house of a ridiculously huge character cast looking at the length of the series (as far as basic seasonal shows go), but, the good thing here is they are handled in an efficient way that gives to everyone a considerable amount of focus and care. Midoriya and Bakugo's relationship goes through a drastic phase, it was anticipated for the longest time now, but the way it all turned up to be was what made it special, we're ages passed the emo days of the likes of Sasuke Uchiha, this series that made everyone doubt it at the end, going as far as calling it a ripoff of other big shows is finally having it's glorious 180 turns on those people.\r\nA lot of new side characters make their debuts as well with well-established backstories and roles, talking here about both supporting characters and villains.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.0/10):\r\nNow, I enjoy my Boku no Hero Academia, and I always have, and I'd calmly even say that this was the season that made the series closer to me, undoubtedly my favorite season as for now.\r\nA lot of turnarounds happened, but they were all for a good reason, and only made the show better. I'm still having problems with the exam arc though.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nAlready a fan of the previous two seasons? Why not hop in right away then? I can at least assurte you that action-wise, this show cuts the cake easily over the previous ones. It's way more serious, emotional, and developed, and on a bigger budget as well. Just like always, mildly family friendly with some few fan service, of course, there's also mild nudity towards the end, a character that makes his debuts seem to have problems keeping on his when fighting, so you'll have to see some butt on this one.\n"
