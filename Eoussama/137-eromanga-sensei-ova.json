    "content": "\n                No words can truly put this franchise into genuine words.\r\nWhat somebody can call art, another would scream of pedophilia (I'm doing my part FBI-san).\r\nThe parent show has managed to redefine the meaning of \u201ctrash\u201d on it's time being aired, and without a doubt, after its conclusion, we all wanted a sequel despite bad-mouthing it to hell in public. And there it is again, threatening our freedom and promising a cold spot in a dark cell at the closes state prison.\r\nThe animation was really well-maintained in this one, consistency on anatomy and faces, I really appreciate the lack of CGI usage.\r\nThe same can be complimented aboutthe vocals, the light soundtracks, the quality voice acting, you just gotta love the sound of a cute tone of voice.\n\r\nI would definitely recommend watching this if you've enjoyed the parent series, it doesn't add that much except for a couple added kisses that should have been in the parent series.\n"
