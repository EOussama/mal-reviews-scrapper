For an extra edition, it sure was very lacking. That saying, I'm watching this back to back to watching the first season, so a recap was not what I was after, however I do find the extra bits quite interesting, the retrospect commentary was also good and engaging, that is, until thescreen is filled with not-so-family friendly shots, and we all know, we love to keep it family-friendly around here.\n\r\nI would say, you're definitely not missing on anything for not seeing this, you'd either be after a refresher on the first season or after some dirty-pleasure fulfillment, then you'd be welcomed because it that respect, the special has you covered.\n"
