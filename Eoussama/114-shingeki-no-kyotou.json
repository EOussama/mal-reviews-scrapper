I haven't attended it in person, I do think it would have made for such an experience to be able to.\r\nThe context was simple, a bunch of official edits of the main series with fabricated dialogue to make up for a parody of the Titans attacking the Tokyo tower, while the main characters of the series are defending it.\r\nDon't think that you've missed out on a huge thing, because all of the shots used are featured in the series in a way or another,however, they didn't have to be all related, a thus, a lot of shots from season two are being juxtaposed with the ones of the first season and order to trick you into thinking it was the same thing, and it actually worked in a pretty cheesy, but cool way.\n"
