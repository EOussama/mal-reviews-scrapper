Bundled with the limited edition of High School DxD DX.2. It tells the story of Issei helping out Phenex, a past villain into getting over his fear of dragons. With the help of Tannin, they go on a journey to the mountains with Ravel accompanying them.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nNot the proudest production inthe franchise but still watchable. The weather particles blend nicely with the night sky backgrounds. The animation, for the most part, was decent and not distracting at all.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nAgain, props the production team for reusing the old great soundtrack, also leaving out the opening and ending theme songs was just what I wanted, great songs by the way.\r\nThe voice acting was okay, and ridiculous too how the can keep screaming perverted non-sense at either other, while probably maintaining a straight face, glorious.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nI put a score as high as I can without having to break my unbiased reviewing this, we get to see the return of a probably one of the m\u00f9ost hated characters in the series, Phenex from the first season who challenged Rias to a rating game to decide whether they get married or not.\r\nThis time around, we got to see a side of Phenex we never had the pleasure to see, really cool and funny guy, dependable and powerful as well, and oddly enough, sharing the same affection as our protagonist. If anything, he could make for a great big brother to Issei.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nQuite a fun watch, I never thought I would like Phenex, I never bothered with him from the get-go, he was just another character that was destined to fade away, but not really, he proved to be a solid well-written character that has more to offer in the future.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nI would definitely recommend this over other OVAs and specials for what it offers of comedy and character development for Phenex. and before you ask, yes, there's immense fanservice as well, so warm up your seat and start the episode.\n"
