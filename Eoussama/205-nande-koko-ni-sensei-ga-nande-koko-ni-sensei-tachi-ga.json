The long-awaited OVA episode that promised to bring along the uncensored version of this shitfest of a fan-serving haven.\n\r\nI was happy, so happy to hear the opening and ending theme songs again after several months, it was strange, filling me with excitement, a bit of sadness, and a whole lot of guilty nostalgia. It was undoubtedly the best part of this OVA. However, the first frame of the uncensored goodness hit me harder than my pp wasduring my first binge-watch. \u201cThis shit is uncensored now?\u201d\n\r\nI don't know what I was expecting, but my man down there was sure happy while I stared at him in disappointment, reassuring my hands a great evening.\r\nI survived.\n\r\nIt is so refreshing hearing these voices again, having watched a lot of heavy narrative shows lately, a guilty pleasure trashy show like this was just what I needed.\n"
