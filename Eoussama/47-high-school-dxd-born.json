Sounds like every sequel ever, a lot of twists have been revealed, and secrets finally unraveled, but does it still hold up against the previous season? specifically, against the magnificent second season?!\n\r\n- Story (7.2/10):\r\nUnlike the first season, that was a pile of fanservice with minimal story progression that gave more focus to nudity and neglected the story, and the second season that had a great sense of plot and development and considerable amount of fanservice, High School DxD BorNwas just a mess that didn't know what to focus on.\r\nDon't get scared, the fanservice in here is still consistent, and highly present to the extent of ruining some great emotional or serious moments, but also, there was so much content compressed into a mere 12 episodes which made the story very fast paced and rushed that so many details were left out or unexplored enough to make any sense out of them. Throughout this season, the plot became very repetitive and highly predictable, while it expanded on other characters, it was just the same thing, character X with sad backstory gets threatened and kidnapped, let's go fellas for the rescue, over and over again.\n\r\n- Art (8.1/10):\r\nThis one was slightly better than the previous seasons, considering how successful they were to provide a better budget, and it was well invested looking back at this season. It looks like the explored universe has gone some amped up physics that only seem to work on the chest areas the most.\r\nThe transformation sequences were just beautiful, a sight worthy of seeing over and over again.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nI'm just fine with the soundtrack as it is, fabulous notes that fill you with immersive and excitement for what's going, talking specifically about the sadistic violin tone that plays on those warm moments of generous fanservice. the same applies to every other piece of music.\r\nThis season had only one opening theme song, which is a blast looking on how I was opposed to the idea of having more than one opening theme song, it was great and catchy, differently better than the past season's second opening. I'd rank it as the third going by this order;\r\nSeason 1 opening > Season 2 opening 1 > Season 3 opening > Season 2 opening 2.\r\nThe ending song was great too with a huge potential for replayability.\r\nThe voice acting I think was great, having to see Issei screaming and shouting in rampaging moments felt intense.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nI don't hate any character, but Asia still has some problems she needs to address.\r\nAl of your favorite characters make an appearance here plus new fine ones, just like the previous season that focused on Kiba and a bit on Akeno, this one was heavily around Koneko's mysterious past and Akeno's ordeal with making it up with her father, but nothing as intense as Kiba went through in my opinion, he is still to this day, the most developed character in the series in my eyes.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.6/10):\r\nI would say that I did enjoy this, but not as much as I was expecting, it was differently better than the first season, but very low on quality compared to the second season. there were those moments that make you hard on action burning with fire seeing those transformations and punches exchange, but some other time, I was just like, why? it doesn't make sense.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nIf you have already made it through the first two seasons, why not watch the third? in my opinion, it's not as good as the build-up at the end of the second season was leading to, but it did have a lot of stuff to show, like new characters, backstories, and more...\r\nDon't worry, they have got you covered with the fanservice.\n"
