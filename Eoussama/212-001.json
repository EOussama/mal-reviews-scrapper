That's what my meme-loving side would love to say, but it seems, MAL does not allow for short reviews so I'll have to stall, or write an informative, distinctive essay. Take it as you will.\n\r\nI remember back in the day, I wanted to practice my writing skills, and as I was heavy on Anime even back then, I thought I could review every Anime I watched, and thus, win both the entertainment that comes with watching an Anime and the skills that develop after writing countless reviews left and right. That was 3 to 4 years ago, and alot changed during that time. I had this ONA scheduled for a review along with several other shorts, but it seems, for some reason, I ended up sleeping on it all of these years, until now. I think I would have tried to buy as much effort as possible, milking every drop of vocabulary I had ta the time, trying to create a meaningful review that breaks beyond the shallow backgrounds of the reviewed entries, but not anymore.\n\r\n\u201c001\u201d is a shitpost. The more I look at them, the more apparent it becomes as if an aspiring animator had his practicing samples leaked by somebody, and this one in particular, while not the absolute worst, it stands for an impressive display of basic animation techniques from a beginner's stand of point, and I'm no expert, but I can tell random scribbles from a Mona Lisa.\n\r\nMaybe the artist intended to deliver some kind of hidden message in all of that pixel real estate, an unknown figure crashing into what looks like a windshield only to be washed off seconds later, having his or her skin removed layer by layer, and off he or she went with the rest of rainwater. That can stand for an analogy about life, as the dripping rainwater is the time that passes the windshield is the a strong-willed person that runs through, discarding any fake friends (The figure that comes crashing the windshield) even if it was just a reoccurring pattern that never turns for the better.\n"
