Sighs*\r\nBefore I start, is it just me or the Host's facial expressions are way creepier than the stories themselves?\n\r\nWell, my favorites if I had to make an ordered list,\r\n1. No Longer Human and Kokoro\r\nOh gosh, those 2, if only they had their own separate shows, I bet they would have made a hell of franchises, I just move the darkness and the backstories, the characters, the emotions, I just love everything about them, definitely hidden gems, a sold 10/10 score as easy as that.\n\r\n2. The Spider's Thread\r\nThe main character, he's got to be one of the best if not the bestcharacter ever created in a show, It just suited the story, and made it even more immersive, his look, ideology, and decisions, he's just unique, 9/10.\n\r\n3. Hell Screen\r\nProbably based on The Spider's Thread story, you can even say it's a continuation of the latter, a hellish society that was indeed, massacre and murder are committed publicly, and no one dares to oppose that cruel Emperor, a classic to say the least, 8/10.\n\r\n4. In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom\r\nNo, this could have been higher on the list, It had so much potential to be a masterpiece on its right, but, the forced humor kinda ruined it, if it was darker and ambiguous, It would have worked out even better, 8/10.\n\r\n5. Run, Melos!\r\nI couldn't relate to the story that much, probably it's the reason I didn't enjoy it as I was supposed to? Friendship ties that endured struggles throughout the years, between an actor and a writer, 7/10.\n\r\nOverall, this gets 8.6, I'd say 9/10 if it wasn't for some withdrawal along the way, totally a deep anime, more likely intended for a more mature audience, I'd definitively recommend it for adults who would like to get into anime, I'm glad I watched this, would never regret passing by, see you all, and good luck.\n"
