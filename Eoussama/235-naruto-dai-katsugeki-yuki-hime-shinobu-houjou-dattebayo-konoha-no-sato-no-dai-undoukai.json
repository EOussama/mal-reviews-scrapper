Not only was this special episode a shitpost, but it was also about a variation of shitting.\n\r\nThe majority of the humor or attempts at it came off as cringy or clich\u00e9 groups that try harder than they should, however, the pay off had me chuckle quite a bit. I liked the hidden references that come off as characters that would never match up with the personality they put up for them in this episode, the 11 minutes long disasterwas almost as painful as Naruto holding in his stomach puke and as good as Naruto felt when he released as it ended.\n"
