The song is so catchy and upbeat, and it perfectly captures the spirit of the show. It's one of those songs that you just can't help but sing along to, even if you don't understand the lyrics.\n\r\nThe music video for \"Bokurano\" is also really cool. It's a simple animation of Eve's character singing and dancing against a black and white background, but it's really effective. The animation is smooth and fluid, and it perfectly matches the energyof the song. It's just a really fun and visually appealing music video.\n\r\nBut let's talk about the song itself. \"Bokurano\" is a great song because it perfectly captures the themes and emotions of Boku no Hero Academia. The song is all about finding strength in yourself and in your friends, and that's what the show is all about. It's about a group of young heroes who are trying to save the world, but they can't do it alone. They need each other's help and support, and that's what makes them strong.\n\r\nThe lyrics of \"Bokurano\" are also really powerful. They're all about standing up for what you believe in, even when things are tough. The chorus of the song is especially memorable, with its refrain of \"we are not alone.\" It's a message of hope and solidarity that really resonates with the show's themes.\n\r\nOverall, I think that \"Bokurano\" is a fantastic opening for Boku no Hero Academia. It's a great song that perfectly captures the spirit of the show, and the music video is a lot of fun to watch. If you're a fan of anime music, or just a fan of Boku no Hero Academia, then you should definitely check out \"Bokurano.\" It's one of the best openings of the series, and it's definitely worth a listen.\n"
