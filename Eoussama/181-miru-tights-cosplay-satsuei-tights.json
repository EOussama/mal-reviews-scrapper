Extremely raw, straight to the point tight related fan service, the teasing is justas strong as ever, but still gets nowhere as exciting as the legendary episode 7 of the parent show.\r\nThe animation quality and the voice acting are not extinguishable from that of the Anime's, it's almost it was one pack with the rest and was only decided that it would be left out as extra for the hungry fans later.\n\r\nBut all in all, it was just another 4 minutes long scrabble with tights stretching and erotic camera angles. It could have been better if we're being honest, but never expect anything from similar shows.\n"
