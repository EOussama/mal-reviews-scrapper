The movie features the game against Murasakibara and Kise from season 2 and 3 respectively, this format is really working out good for this franchise.\n\r\nI mean, expect nothing special, if anything, these highlights are the perfect route to take if you're up for a lightweight rewatch, even for people who know nothing about the series.\n"
