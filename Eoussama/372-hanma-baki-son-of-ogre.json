The Arizona state prison, home of the unchained, it felt like a long time coming ever since the OG 2ng season of Baki, it's definitely a milestone, and it shows.\n\r\nIf there is anything this season nails on the head is the artistic direction, it feels like the Manga panels are coming alive, so little CG reliance that it's not even noticeable, and a lot of beautifully choreographed muscle play. The dialog is as hilarious as ever, and the disrespect from multiple parts has never been so humiliating and intense.\n\r\nThe doesn't even try to highlight Baki as a deep character at this point, and if you've returned just to get some of that then you're 3 seasons late into realization. However, I must say, it does not shy from spotlighting other side characters. It was definitely Oliva's season and it didn't stop there.\n\r\nBaki is as wacky as ever, if not, more so than it ever was, starting with shadow fighting, to whatever happened at the end, it is definitely loyal to Itagaki's vision on what ever orgy he's writing.\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\n"
