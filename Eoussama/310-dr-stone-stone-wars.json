    "content": "\n                It's very fortunate for us fans to have gotten a second season of Dr. Stone not long after season one ended, and man, what a season has it been, although, not of the same length, but still managed to pack so much content that it felt like a three cour season that we finally realize, unironically, the story is only started, for what these two last seasons were only the prologue of a long and complex story that stretches as far as the horizon and beyond.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nAfter the reveal of the title of the season a year ago \u201cStone Wars\u201d, many fans were worried thatthe series is heading for what it doesn't excel at the most. Warfare. After the mediocre mini-tournament arc of the first season, we all agreed that if anything the series fails at is action-centric combat, it is the perfect show that brings the nerd out of us, the type that dislikes physical conflict and craves science and intellect, so it was a natural reflex for most of it to get turned off by the title alone, fearing it's going to be one gigantic battlefield with blood and slaughter only for Boichi to dunk on us and introduce us to what's probably the best part of the show, narratively speaking.\r\nThe plot feels more fast-paced, adapting several chapters each episode which keeps you on your toes the whole episode which twists and turns especially nearing the end of the season.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nSeason one taught us it was never about industry-defining animation, and more about an onion enjoying science and building civilization, it was good enough to not such and bad enough to not stand out but it was not holding back the show, which is most important.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nIf not for the opening and ending theme songs, both seasons would have been on the same rank when it comes to sound composition, but I would be lying if I gave the win to this season, although the opening and endings were good, there were not as good as season 1's.\r\nThe voice acting was not that much different either, the same performance all way around.\n\r\nCharacters (9.2/10):\r\nI gotta give it to this season character-wise, for starters, the cast is bigger than ever but also, more intimate and varying. So many good characters are introduced and expanded upon, even Tsukasa grows as a character and shows real remorse. Development at its peak was documented this season, no complaints here.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nWatching the first season, I fear that with how much I liked it there was never going to be another season of the same show that compares, but luckily, I was proven wrong, it's just how the series works, almost an afterthought. The essence of the story remained the same, only with a bigger cast and riskier stakes.\n\r\nOverall (9.04/10):\r\nI see no reason for skipping this season, if you enjoyed the first season, you would love this one, if you didn't like the first season, you would enjoy this one, it's an upgrade through and through.\n"
