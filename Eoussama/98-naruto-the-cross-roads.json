It was all fast-paced action that Orochimaru orchestrated in order to \u201ctest Sasuke and tease later events like him switching sides.\r\nIt really felt like a painful excuse to milk an OVA out of all the build-up that lead to him joining the Akatsuki, with few references to Itachi and the Uchiha clan.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nCGI, and before you face the other side and start running away, it actually looked decent, not the best, One Piece Mugiwara Chase 3D had me pin it as one if not the best 3D adaptation for an already long-running serialization and Naruto tried holding on to the safe zone and was almost there.\r\nIt all looked more like a game cutscene rather than a normal animated episode, keeping it as close to 2D as possible differently helped lower the strangeness of it a bit. The water mechanics were cool, the smoke animation as well. However the fights despite being a lot more fluid and organic they still felt like a stranger and took away a lot of what made Naruto fights look cool.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nI really appreciate the nostalgic soundtracks and sound effects.\r\nThe voice acting was above average, nothing too jaw-dropping. A lot of room for improvement is different there, it seems so cheap for a milestone anniversary to be honest.\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\r\nDisappointed, Sasuke couldn't be less out of character here, you'd figure they would give her a moment of shine in such an important OVA like this one, she still played the bait role after all and contributed in nothing good.\r\nThe focused bad guys had terrible character designs and even worse ideology, they looked way too weak for the struggles they put team 7 at. Generally, very forgettable and interesting to say the least.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nThe main spotlight here was enjoying the hand to hand combat with minimal ninjutsu (remember when it was all about that?).\r\nProbably the coolest thing was the references to future arcs, even the ones in Shippuden. Such a waste, it had literally no re-watch value whatsoever.\n\r\n- Overall (6.4/10):\r\nI would strongly suggest avoiding this until you've watched through the first 300 episodes of Naruto Shippuden. Despite it being set on the timeline of the original series, it does deal with topics from future arcs, even going as far as showing massive spoiler clips from mid-Shippuden.\n"
