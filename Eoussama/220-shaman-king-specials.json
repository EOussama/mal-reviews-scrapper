For two major time gaps, the first, way back in my childhood, I remember playing GTA VC on our family computer, all the while glancing sideways to catch glimpses of this show that was airing at the time, bit by bit, making up the general story as I go; until I decided to rewatch the thing properly around 3 to 4 years ago, and now, this marks the time of finally sealing my experience with this show as I finish the only related piece of animation it has,(these special episodes).\n\r\nFeaturing five varying in length episodes, composed of mostly recaps of the entire show, from different perspectives of the cast member, they retell the same things mostly, but some have other pieces that the rest is missing. It's one of those specials that I would have hated to sit through back when I had just finished watching the parent show, but 3 years later, I'm having a blast remembering every other twist that engulfed throughout the serialization of the show. I got to remember the characters I liked, the characters I hated, and the characters that I may have discarded as being doll and cheezy, but just realized how funny and likable they are. It's not a mandatory special bundle that one has to see in other to claim to have watched the entire series, but one that truly reminiscent with you, the further back you've finished watching the original series.\n"
