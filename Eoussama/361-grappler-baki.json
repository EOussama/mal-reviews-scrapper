Something about this old, crusty animation felt more alive and appealing than the TV series, it was clunky but responsive, amateur but full of life, and it definitely had a distinct flair for the action.\n\r\nGiven the short airtime, I couldn't be harsher on the mediocrity of the storytelling, it was a queue of fights against some fighters that we see in the main series, one thing I should mentionthough is how better and more ominous Shinogi looks here, scarier and intimidating that on the main series. And without forgetting this version of Baki, it's honestly my favorite looking version of him.\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10,\n"
