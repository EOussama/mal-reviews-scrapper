That's how I went in, completely open to anything with a bit of disguised hesitation, but oh boy did I get rid of any faint traces of regrets during the first 10 minutes of the first episode.\n\r\nStory: (8.6/10):\r\nWe all know a good first episode is what makes the biggest impression for an entire season, a badone hurts the name of the show, and a good one no matter how awful the series gets afterward does keep up the buzz and roll-down conversations.\r\nIn Beastars' case, from the very first moments, we are already invested by being presented with a murder mystery and a setting that sounds very familiar and yet so new and refreshing with an uncanny resemblance to the real world.\r\nHighschool Anime is probably the biggest over the saturated setting in the medium, probably because of the audience target, but not every high school drama can relate to everyone no matter the age gap which makes it a hit or miss for most people, Beastars comes with its own twist, big enough to leave an impact.\r\nManifesting the characters as animals was a genius 4-head move as it only amplifies and highlights gruesome real-world problems like racism, slavery, unfair prejudice, and self-discovering. A truer than words coming of age story.\n\r\nArt: (9/10):\r\nSo we all know how unforgiving the fandom is towards CGI use in Anime, after all, it started as a 2D plain of storytelling but one cannot undertake the changes the medium knew over the years, and CGI is definitely one of the most hated and controversial techniques known to the fans, and most of the hate comes from the poor implementation of said technique, however, Beastars is here to re-evaluate this statement showing how varying CGI can bring to storytelling in Anime, being from creative lighting techniques, dynamic camera angles and artistic use of shading.\r\nThe character design was great and in sync with the voice acting, the facial expressions were very good and on point and so were the movements and all of the gestures performed by the characters, lying perfectly between human performance and its anima counterpart.\n\r\nSound: (9.2/10):\r\nBeing a Netflix show really has a special vibe attached to it, the voice acting especially sounds better than your generic highschool drama Anime. Despite being animals in human clothing, the pattern of speech and the emotion leaking with every spoken word is more human than anything else in the show.\r\nThe OSTs were great and the opening and endings were even greater.\n\r\nCharacters: (8.5/10):\r\nEvery season has that one character everyone hates and loathes, but Beastars defies the seasonal norms yet again with a lively, dramatic cast of characters with different backgrounds and hardships, unique treats, and characteristics, each with their own motives and compassion.\r\nLegoshi is a fantastic protagonist that you don't always see in similar Anime, him being a wolf, a \u201clone-wolf\u201d, if you will, really complements his loneliness and emptiness that drives his animal shell that carries his human heart and Luis is just the best playing his antagonistic role better than anyone from my recent memory with his beautiful pair of antlers that almost scratch ceilings, symbolizing the burden of the expectations and hopes that other people have for him.\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10):\r\nI hate this expression, I hate how it reads, how it sounds, and how it's grammatically composed, but ever since I finished the first two episodes it started echoing in my busy head endlessly. \u201cThis show hits different\u201d.\r\nNo, hear me out, I'm not a high schooler, and definitely not an animal, but for this to relate to me the way it did definitely says a lot of things, good things. I guess it did take a bunch of animals and a drama club for me to fulfill my long-lasted itch for a good drama. Nonstop suspense and anticipation the likes of which leave an impression for a lifetime, and now that I have finished Beastars I can finally say, \u201cI get it\u201d.\n\r\nOverall: (9.06/10)\r\nBeastars is a one in every year show, it comes off as a strange, kinky, and misleading premise that throws most people off, but at the core, it criticizes the very same stereotyping of thinking, only adding to the irony that it both surrounds and surrounded by.\n"
