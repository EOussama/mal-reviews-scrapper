The Seirin gang is chilling at the cheapest McDonald's rip-off while commenting over what happened on the first season in a very comedic way. The cream of the top really resides on the arrival of the members of the generation of miracles, the out-of-character act was precious and good of a reason to watch this 9 minutes special, the sight of Aomine acting along makes him loo so approachable unlike the main show thought us.\n\r\nUnder the cover \u201cKuroko no Basket: Oshaberi Shiyokka\u201d isjust another recap episode trying to be quirky and sneaky about it, although, I do appreciate the original content even if it made no sense canonically.\n"
