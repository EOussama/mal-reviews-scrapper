However, a recap dropped, and as the completionist I am, I had to watch it. Great, now I can rest in peace without having to worry about this horrifying show, but oh no no, they just had to announce a second season. End me.\n\r\nA two-episode special bundle was released that priors the second season, which turned out to be just sneaked up recap episodes in both freaking damn episodes. Both do nothing but repeat the samething that the recap OVA did, I still do not know the purpose behind this. To keep it short, if you are fed up with this franchise, just be at ease, there is nothing you're missing if you decided to not invest in this 16 long useless animation, just go enjoy the free time you have until the second season drops if that interests you.\n"
