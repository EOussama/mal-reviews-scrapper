    "content": "\n                \u201cYou get to a certain point when you just want to get to the meat of a review, you've already made it through a prequel, you've seen all of what the critical reviews can offer already, so just get to the point\u201d, I'm sure a good percentage of people that care about reading other people's reviews repeat this sentence even on an unnoticeable level before digging in on these type of critics and I'm no exception myself, as flat forward Dandy is, the goal of my reviews draw heavily on that, drop all the deal weight and clutter only relevant information that both praises andbashes a specific show accordingly, and I'm no judger... and no J.K Rowling either. Or else I would have already called all of you gay for reading the review and call it a day, baby.\r\nSee above \ud83d\udc46? That's how easy it is to stray out of actually reviewing something and stalling for the extra paragraph to pad your already empty piece of uncohesive sentences that don't say anything despite taking up all of your screens. See? I've done it again, baby.\r\nWith a plot-free show much like the first season basically was (although it's debatable, but that's what the general public opinion is), Space Dandy isn't tied up to the traditional methods of sculpting up a proper storyline that holds itself against other broad titles, it speaks through the humor and irony of mocking up both real life and other high and mighty nouveau-rich names that try to scale up against the odds, it doesn't need a deep character behind it or even a super relatable one that makes all of the 14-year-olds go nuts memeing on social media and giving r/im14andthisisdeep something to feed upon. But season 2 embraced that change along with its loved and praised own made up way of developing a plot and throws you into a mix between both world's finest that you're left to appreciate the \u201cupgrade\u201d that you know a lot of people hate because change is something bad apparently. But this is how Space Dandy gives the middle finger to that, baby.\n\n\r\nStory (9.5/10):\r\nI can't say this for the majority of the first season, it was freaking amazing on its own way, but let's be honest, episodes that threw hints on what actually was going on were always there, and before you question in agony \u201cwait, this show has a plot?\u201d; yes it does, and always had since episode 1 season 1. Remember the two empires that were always warring? All fo those dimension-crossing jokes that get thrown around every single episode? All of those become relevant, so relevant in fact it makes Tube Simulator not relevant a single bit. And no, I don't want Pyramides (Only a 9-year-old would get the past references), baby.\r\nThere is a sense of immense satisfaction when finally when you've made it to the last episode and starting to link everything together, \u201choly shrimp, that makes a lot of sense\u201d is your catchphrase for the rest of the day after you finish watching the end-game. It's always been there, genuinely hidden it makes you chuckle all the time when you're on a re-watch. which you should totally do, baby.\n\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nTalk about astonishing and consistency as a duo that never fall short to keep up the same pace, there hasn't been a single episode that lacked the same quality content, visually speaking. Probably because of how varying it was. Remember how the previous season had all of those \u201cdifferent\u201d episodes that tackle different themes, arching from sad to goofy, yes takes it to a whole other level that it also packs up its own unique art style and animation, I could have sworn some of the episodes was so freaking visually wondering that I would mistake them for a world-class piece of painting, baby.\n\n\r\nSound (10/10):\r\nDisney, you should welcome a new competitor to your game, and yes, I'm talking about that legendary musical episode, how can an episode get even more divine each moment it continues until it gives you the south eargasm you've been leaning forward to but never expected to get in such a show? Leave it to Dandy I guess, baby.\r\nSo glad they kept the opening and ending sequences from the past season, and even introduced episode specials when they had to, and they were just as good (exclusive to the ending by the way), baby.\r\nI'm just going say, that, yeah, I'm making small paused, because, it's an important acknowledgment for me to make. Space Dandy has the best English dub I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. No, it's just, there is no contest, Space Cowboy held that title for so long it's time to let a new face sit on that thrown, baby.\n\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\r\nWho said a character had to have a complicated backstory to be up there with the big names? Just name it Dandy and there you go, you've just created an icon. But seriously, how can you hate on this refined legend?\r\nDandy, the man that needs no introduction, with as much dandiness a man could ever ask for is finally getting some booty, or should I say almost, either way, it's for you to interpret, finally given some closure on why it's only him, what makes him so special, and it seems with that many episodes around him, you kind of get why, but not really, turned out there was a deeper sense behind him all along. Let's just say, he's that thing you never want to mess with or you'll end up messing up the whole universe, baby.\r\nIt looked like QT and Meow got enough recognition from the first season as they had entire episodes centered around them, I wish there was more to uncover on them, but it was all dedicated for Dandy and his \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but you can always enjoy the goodness it gave us concerning Scarlet and Honey, even Dr. Gel had some great screening along with a specific character called Johhny who praise will require me to write a separate review on how cool a character he is, he didn't drop the line \u201chere comes Johnny\u201d for nothing, baby.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nIt takes a lot for me to let down from this perfect score, but considering the satisfaction, I got out of this show? If it can be converted to raw energy I'll be an oil mine to start world war 3, baby.\r\nI loved the gags, the fourth wall breaking jokes slammed the walls harder than ever, and the characters and theme discussed were some of my favorites, it has everything from death, love, relationships... baby.\r\nThis season had some of my all-time favorite episodes, along with the first season, of course, those were some of the most intense and genuin laughs I've ever got, baby.\r\nBut that's not all of it, it really walks you through a lot of different scenarios, it shows you the man Dandy really is, how much mystery he held inside of him all along, it's so was beautiful it can inspire you to do things, baby.\n\n\r\nOverall (9.6/10):\r\nHonestly, even if I was trying not to recommend this series, this season, in particular, makes it a confirmed yes from me, I would probably go rewatch the first season just so I can rewatch this one alone, and when they say they don't come up with shows like these lately, they are not joking at the very least. But each one has their cup of tea I guess, I still get that people don't actually like this series at all for how blunt and goofy it is, but it's the premise all along, it's about the comedy primarily, and the hidden depth secondarily. and I learned that slowly as I've always wondered why was this season way more praised than the first one even those the latter was beautiful, but I guess it's up for the mood too to decide. At least for now, all I can see is, see you Space Dandy...\n"
