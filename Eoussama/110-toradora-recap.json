Portable\u201d, is a recap episode exclusive to the PSP game of the same title, it goes in the same direction as any recap episode out there. The pacing, in general, was good, they covered only the important stuff and looked like they jumped through a lot of other non-mentioned thins, but as far as a recap goes, it felt like it told everything it needed to.\r\nHaving not seen the parent show in a long time, this was definitely a refresher to the series although it didn't cover up the very last portion of the show and stopped somewhere at the Chrismas.\r\nTheonly issue with this is the lack of English subs if there are any at all.\n"
