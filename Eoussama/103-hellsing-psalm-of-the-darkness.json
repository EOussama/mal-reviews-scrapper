    "content": "\n                To think I told myself so many times that I've reviewed enough weird abominations that dare call themselves Anime to be able to call off the bullshit on spot feels very naive from old me. But then again, I can never predict what I'll watch in the next 5 minutes, but for now, I'm having this as the downfall of it all.\r\nIt felt rather like those old ambitious but crappy AMV from the old youtube poop background, with no matching music or purpose but to transition from random shots of the series, be them relevant or not, they looked badass, so why not?\n\r\n- Art (4/10):\r\nTheoriginal series (which is what this short is based upon) didn't have the greatest art style and/or animation out there, however, the quality never suffered despite that. It was beautiful in its own way. \u201cHellsing: Psalm of Darkness\u201d includes various shots from the series, however, the bad context and flashy swift transition don't leave room for the old not-so-fluid animation to breath, if anything, that sudden switch only makes the image kind of blur and drops from its quality.\n\r\n- Sound (2/10):\r\nYep, not a single thing to praise. Voice acting wasn't it here, very few snippets from various contexts all over the parent series with no particular juxtaposition, not one that's painfully obvious that is.\r\nThe music wasn't that good either, should I even call it music? A bunch of random noises trying to make some sense.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (5/10):\r\nI'm very picky when it comes to short duration guilty pleasure. And \u201cHellsing: Psalm of Darkness\u201d reminded me of the reason why. I loved Hellsing, both the original and the remake, watched all the other OVAs and what not and had no complaint, biot not until I fall upon watching this, and there I was, staring at this pile of disappointment and bashing an ignorant eye on it as if it never happened. Perhaps that was the right thing to do from the start. One thing, however, there was a distinguishable sequencial event from what appear to be respecting the same order as the parent show, where it really helped serve a great refresher on the big plot points of the earlier adaptation for that I'm thankful.\n\r\n- Overall (3.6/10):\r\nEven for 3 minutes, it was a huge waste of time and energy, a pathetic insult to the great franchise of Hellsing. The mere idea of having this kind of low-quality trash as a standalone release is just so infuriating and disappointing at the same time.\n"
