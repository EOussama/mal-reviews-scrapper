It's like the perfected form of Recap episodes mixed with new content and parody while remaining extremely short and heavy on comedy.\r\nIt's so fun to see characters acting out of characters once in a while, bringing together some of the highlights of the show and making a spin on them in man ways.\r\nOf course, not all of the episodes were on par but some were gold. I hope the later seasons also have bloopers because it's something we really need more of. Gotta appreciate the people in chargeof thinking of this. More content of something you love. It's a win no matter you look at it.\n"
