If you've never seen it in HD, this is a great opportunity to rewatch it in the new Wano animation, if not, it's still a great time. You can never go wrong with Romance Dawn.\n\r\nThe beginning of the episode includes a sneak peek of the beginning of Film Red, teases up some stuff, and then switches on to full recap mode. Also, Uta sings more greatness.\n\r\nMaybe having already seen Film Red when it premiered is makingme more biased but even without that, the recap portion was truly good, early One Piece had a certain charm to it and this recap showcases that.\n"
