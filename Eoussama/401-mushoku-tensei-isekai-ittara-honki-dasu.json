But, upon its airing, Mushoku Tensei proved to be a force to be reckoned with, an anime that was impossible to ignore. The fanfare surrounding it was palpable, with many hailing it as \"the forefather of modern Isekai\" and \"the genesis of the genre\". But, as is my wont, I prefer to form my own opinions, rather than be swayed by the hype. And I am glad I did so with this show.\n\r\nMushoku Tensei is a fantasticand refreshing take on the Isekai genre. The show's pacing, world-building, and character development are top-notch, making it a true standout in the crowded field of fantasy anime.\n\r\nI shall not be a sycophantic NPC, blindly praising the show despite its many merits. It began with an invented language, which, when you consider the premise of the story, makes perfect sense. The pacing is another aspect that I found to be exceptional - it was brisk, yet not overly so. The frequent use of time skips served to further the narrative and the character development was superb, with the protagonist, in particular, being a complex and nuanced character with many redeeming qualities. And, speaking of pacing, the show made clever use of its limited 23 minutes of airtime by interspersing shots of landscapes and characters in their everyday lives during the openings, building up the world in a subtle and effective manner. I found this to be a delightful quirk of the show.\n\r\nBut, as with any work of fiction, there were aspects that I found to be less than satisfactory. The protagonist, for one, was at times both creepy and disturbingly off-putting. The show seemed to revel in depicting his past life as a scumbag, with instances of child grooming, rape, and sexual assault being depicted in graphic detail. It felt gratuitous and unnecessary and detracted from the overall narrative. And then there is the animation, which, while being visually stunning at times, was too good to be true. Especially for an Isekai, this level of animation is rare, and I hope it becomes the norm. The fantasy worlds depicted in the genre have the potential to be so much more than what we are used to seeing, and Mushoku Tensei truly hit the jackpot in this regard.\n\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of Mushoku Tensei was its ability to seamlessly blend slice-of-life elements with fantasy and adventure. The first half of the series was especially effective in this regard, as it delved into the daily lives of its characters and their struggles to adapt to their new world. The show was able to create a sense of immersion and relatability that was truly captivating and made it easy for the audience to become invested in the story and its characters.\n\r\nHowever, as the series progressed, it began to shift away from its slice-of-life roots and increasingly focused on action and adventure. While these elements were certainly exciting, they felt somewhat out of place and disconnected from the more grounded and relatable first half of the series. The show began to feel like just another generic Isekai, and it became increasingly difficult to stay engaged with the story as it progressed.\n\r\nIn particular, the second half of the series felt oversaturated with the typical tropes and cliches of the Isekai genre and failed to bring anything new or unique to the table. The pacing became slower, the plot became more convoluted and less focused, and the characters were less well-developed. Ultimately, it felt like the show was trying too hard to appeal to the typical Isekai audience, and lost sight of what made it so special in the first place.\n\r\nAll in all, Mushoku Tensei was a show that had the potential to be truly great, but ultimately fell short of its potential. It was at its best when it was focused on slice-of-life elements, but as it shifted towards action and adventure, it became bogged down by the over-saturation of the genre and lost its charm. It is still a show that is worth watching, but it is important to keep in mind that it's not as great as it could have been.\n\r\nOverall: 8.1/10.\n"
