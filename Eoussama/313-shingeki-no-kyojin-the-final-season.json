Attack on Titan has been the talk of the hour for years, but now, more than ever. So Here's one that won't offend anyone.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nAttack on Titan might have started its fame because of the action and hype-driven battles, but that shifted bit by bit till it became the classic literal masterpiece that everyone likes to claim it to be.\r\nThe final season started from the get-go on amuch darker tone than we used to, more mature and with higher stakes than ever. It's no longer a tale about the boy that wants to slaughter Titans, as every insignificant move can result in a worldwide conflict, the politics got more involved and an essential part of the story, even more so than season three, the revelations from the past season did not only impact the characters, but also the world and the passage of events.\r\nSeason by season, Attack on Titan only got more deserving of rewatches, as every season lead you to restart the series from season one episode one in fear that more things might have gone past you with little context or clue, the show has almost become a metaphor of its former self, heroes are not villains and vice versa, trust no one even the characters you empathized with for three earlier season.\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nThis is a controversial one. It's either Mappa's efforts into utilizing CGI more were a big mess or Wit studio put the bar higher than what Mappa could deliver on. What the series was famously praised on in the earlier season was the phenomenal use of dynamic 3D  cameras and the blend of 2D and 3D animation to the point of being impossibly noticeable is all gone, all that remains are grotesque and ugly 3D models used for the environment and Titan models, calling it ugly in this circumstance doesn't necessarily mean bad, it was decent 3D animation, far from bad, however, not as good as the three earlier seasons spoiled us about. I guess no matter how big production is, a studio change leaves grave marks.\r\nThe character designs are closer to the Manga's so that's a plus for Mappa, however, Wit did a flawless job on that that the Anime became so many people's headcanon.\r\nThe animation was the weakest part of this season, but not as bad as something that would ruin the experience, this season has more focus on the plot than action so it can easily be overlooked as it did not hinder what's important. The story. \n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nAnother controversial aspect of the show, I don't want to call out an entire fandom, but some people are just as mad as to send death threats to the show's staff just because they did not put their favorite OST on a certain moment, guys, grow up.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs followed the show's trend of actually keeping up the quality. The opening was something very, very different from what we're used to which I thought reflected perfectly the hellish atmosphere that engulfs this entire section of the story.\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\r\nThe best thing about a time-skip season is seeing how much the characters changed, Attack on Titan hit the nail so hard on this one that the cast is practically different people with the same names.\r\nTake these three characters as an example, Eren, Zeke, and Reiner.\r\nEren has definitely grown so much in the past three seasons but that did not come close to what he has become. Entire mood and charisma change, he really reflected the burden the entire island's expectations on him, he is no longer someone who wants to slaughter the Titans because of what they robbed him of, he is the key and hope of everyone that has been living on Paradise since ay one, thus making him an unstoppable force that won't fudge in front of anything and anyone who's holding him back. Taking a look at Zeke, the bastard hated the bad guy who did so much damage to the protagonists and their cause, cursed by so many fans has won back a great deal of following by showing a growth unmatched by most characters ending up as a non-shallow fellow who also has dreams and aspirations worthy of respect. The same goes for Reiner, the traitor backstabber that appears to be like the sweetest most loving big brother figure and mentor, he grew through his struggles and is still suffering from them as he shifts between both sides of living and death, he's had enough, but to what end.\r\nAnd it does not stop at that three characters,s every single character introduce earlier even for a split of a second got time to shine and show how much it has progressed. Other than the familiar faces we grew to hate and love, so many new characters were introduced, and even moments after their introduction felt like fellas that we knew since day one, perhaps due to the parallel similarities in the case of Eran and Gabi for example, but that's a discussion for another day.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nIt's apparent, anyone watching four seasons of a show loves it enough to give it as many chances like that. Season four was a breed of its own, quite symbolic that everything changes even the story shifts as the production studio changed, signaling a metaphorical end to an era and the beginning of a new one. A round every conversation's conclusion lies a shocking revelation or a story changing confession, things changed faster than most people can keep up and it's a point of strength in Attack on Titan's case as it was made from the ground up to make more and more sense as you keep rewatching it over and over again.\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10):\r\nA good show gives, but a great show keeps on giving, Attack on Titan doesn't o that by the seasons but by the episode, no wonder it got to the place it's now. It's almost Attack on Titan IS the Anime fandom at this point, everyone is talking about it, every conversation is revolving around it, it's almost as anyone not into it is not even in the Anime fandom, to begin with. I know that's a toxic thought to share, I don't believe in it but everyone makes it out to be the absolute truth. This season is a wild card, it's either liked or loved, nothing in between, people who adore the previous season may detest it, and people who disliked all earlier seasons might fall in love with it, that's how different everything was about this season.\n"
