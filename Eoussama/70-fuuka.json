Not forgetting the incest references, of course, showing several naked scenes than necessary, so keep up your family distance on this one. A show that's been accused of having the wrong protagonist, and honestly, childhood friends have had enough of this, and Fuuka doesn't go easy a bit. But that doesn't exclude people from claiming it to be one of their favorites, going as far as paring it with the fantastic\u201cClannad\u201d, that's where I draw a thick line folks, and I'm about to clear the reason about that in this review.\n\r\n- Story (5/10):\r\nAkitsuki Fuuka (wow how original of the show's title), a clumsy go-lucky highschool girl (the daughter of Akitsuki Yamato and Asahina Suzuka, the protagonists of the indirect prequel of this show, \u201cSuzuka\u201d) is at a very relatable stage of her life, that one hard-to-knock-off-wall that goes about having students decide what they are going to do next. In the other side, you have your typical silent unsocial male protagonist, Haruna Yuu, that has an extreme obsession about sharing every bit of detail about his life on Twitter. The two happen to meet each other, and right from the first episode already manage to get as close as one can call a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And with that, the flaws of the show start to mercilessly attack every sense of logic remaining. I still can't grasp how could an individual (Yuu, the protagonist) join a band with no talent or prior knowledge to music, only being there because some random girl he met told him to. The show at first gives a really focused view on Yuu and Fuuka, I've seen this strategy before, making the viewers ship the heck out of them until we get mercilessly stabbed at the heart by the introduction of this childhood friend that apparently has always had a crush on Yuu. Meet Hinashi Koyuki, both a member of this little love triangle and overall a very famous idol that the other side of the triangle (Fuuka) is a big fan of. \u201cThat is some seriously interesting setup\u201d, said old naive me that had more expectations on this show than it actually delivered upon. Right after she's introduced she goes through causing misfortune between the two only for her to get hurt by the end of the story and the two obvious pair get back along again. Now try to picture that turn of events, but in the most terrible way you can, that's what Fuuka, and extremely below average show in terms of love stories is. And that's excluding the other side characters, like this one girl, Iwami Sara, a girl that showed hostile behavior towards the protagonist at first to only make a complete 180\u00b0 split in personality for no apparent reason going as far as threatening their modest love triangle to becoming a square. I feel that the show could have been better if they focused more about the actual band's growth and them realizing their dreams, but of course, with them having the right qualifications.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nMost definitely the only good thing this show did right, yeah, give me more of them crispy looking animations, those oddly-ordered lines make for such a relaxing view for my eyes. And honestly, without this, the show would have never stand on its feet.\r\nThe color palette was so diverse and colorful, taking a non-realistic art style that really suited this show for being the genre it is. One of the many things I appreciate about Fuuka (rare of me to say) was the sense of fashion, the characters looked as if they were staging for some world-class clothing magazine, all looked very tidy and elegant, and I'm backing this up for you, hips out there. One thing that really left a bad taste on my memory was that adults, kids, and teenagers, all looked similar with no signs of aging gaps, I'm talking about parents looking as young if not younger than their kids, it was ridiculous.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nBeing a show heavily centered on music, that is if we don't count the childish drama. Those were some really good songs, to be honest, I didn't give the opening theme song credits at first, but it grew on me as far as making me want to clap for them when they decided to feature it as one of their hits on some episodes. The voice acting was decent but could have been better if not for the painfully cringy dialogue they put the actors through. And then again, there is the classic Engrish, one of the strongest, in fact. I really have to emphasize more on how good the music was or else I'm not going to get this unlucky feeling off that I'm getting right now.\n\r\n- Character (6/10):\r\n\u201cNext please\u201d, that would have been my quote of the day if I was in charge of recruiting actors for a live action and replicas of the show's characters happened to be involved. There was no single memorable character that brought something new with it. You had your friendship above all types of people, and there was also the selfish bastard that goes about ruining everything the show built upon for 10 episodes. 10!!!!! are you kidding me?\r\nShipping was really intense at first, but then, it was like, why even bother, just let this end quickly I don't wanna get rid of my dropped-shows-virginity yet. I can give the protagonist credit at least for curing his addiction to Twitter, but that was it. And to this day, I don't think I'll even know how could someone with no talent in a medium perform that well in it, and in such a short time, it really goes as far as contradicting the philosophical meaning of a \u201cTalent\u201d.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nIt's very odd to have animals like pigs that eat practically anything that they can swallow, but what's even more mindblowing is how could one enjoy something they criticise this bad. I'm not going to lie on myself, I did have a bit of guilty pleasure watching Fuuka, not because of some deep plot points, not because of the revolutionary characters, but rather how decent it served as a time killer. At least it didn't put me to sleep at night or made me count how many times I yawned every 3 minutes. I had my fair share of rooting, shipping and cheering, but towards the end, it dropped massively.\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\r\nFuuka is a type of show I'm going to be very careful about calling it a good show out loud, there is no way in hell I'll recommend this as a solid romance experience for how bratty and unfunny the drama turned out to be. As for me, seeing that many shows already makes me realize how low in scale this appears next to greater franchises, but for you out there who are planning to have this as one of their first takes on the romance genre, please don't, it would end up affecting your tastes in a bad way.\n"
