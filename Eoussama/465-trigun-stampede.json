As a long-time fan of the original Trigun series, I approached this remake with skepticism. But to my pleasant surprise, it exceeded my expectations and left me with a nostalgic feeling that I haven't felt in a long time.\n\r\nThe show starts with Meryl Stryfe and Roberto De Niro, two reporters on the hunt for Vash, a notorious outlaw. What they find instead is a man who couldn't be more different from the one they were expecting. Vash is peaceful and beloved by the residents ofthe town he resides in. His reputation as a violent terrorist is actually the result of his evil twin brother's actions. Vash's past and his brother's looming presence set the stage for an action-packed and thrilling adventure.\n\r\nThe use of CGI animation in Trigun Stampede might make some viewers wary, but the series completely shattered my doubts. The 3D animation was beautifully done and conveyed the story with a cinematic flair that I've never seen before. It was artistic, polished, and fit the futuristic world of Trigun perfectly.\n\r\nThe remake is a solid reimagining of the original series, with new characters that fit in perfectly with the old ones. Roberto, in particular, was a standout character for me. His enthusiasm and loyalty to Vash were infectious, and I found myself rooting for him throughout the show.\n\r\nBut it's the OG cameos that really hit home for me. Seeing characters like Wolfwood and Milly again after so many years was a nostalgic and heartwarming experience. The show also did a fantastic job of incorporating familiar themes from the original series, such as Vash's quest for peace and the idea that there's always hope, even in the darkest of times.\n\r\nOverall, Trigun Stampede was a fantastic anime that exceeded my expectations. It was a nostalgic journey that reminded me why I fell in love with the original Trigun series in the first place. The stunning visuals, excellent storyline, and memorable characters make it a must-watch for any fan of the franchise.\n\r\nOverall: 8.62/10.\n"
