This OVA was released at a questionable state, with 6 months of time between the two episodes.\r\nThe OVA discards whatever the series had of \u201cplot\u201d, leaving you only with a couple of wholesome episodes that provide more of the fan-service and comedy level. It steers the current on the fandom ships quite hard, leaving none disappointed.\n\r\nIt is the type of OVA that leaves you wanting though. A season 3 might not be enough bythis point, heck, have it serialize on a weekly basis, and no one is complaining.\n"
