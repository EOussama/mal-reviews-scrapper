Fear that it might not deliver on the Psycho-Pass hype I was accumulating for all of these years, but in the end, it came back to it. I watched the first SS Case, it was average I'd say, and then I watched the second one, which succeeded in reassuring me. The final torch was handed to the third and last movie, I wanted it to be good, I wanted it to be more than just the last one, and fortunately, it surpassed even my expectations.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nThemovie at hand is both a sequel to the last movie, but even more so, a direct sequel to the first Psycho-Pass movie \u201cPsycho-Pass: The Movie\u201d that follows Kougami in his journey that covers how he sets up his fourth coming into the third season. And mind you, I haven't seen the third season yet, but it's a telling from the conclusion of this movie.\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of the prequel, the plot is very action-based, it's motivated by the overdramatic shooting, epic drone battles and of course, the fascinating hand to hand combat.\r\nAlthough perhaps the whole movie was pushing the franchise to hopefully go back to its roots, that is, a mystery detective thriller, it did so little of that than meets the eye.\n\r\nArt (9.2/10):\r\nThe visuals in this one, oh my God.\r\nI thought the last one improved on that from the first SS case movie, but this one just blows everything out of the water. I can't believe I'm praising CGI now, the way those bags were swinging in the raging winds of the Himalaya looked so eye batting. The colors were vibrant, I mean, it's India we're talking about here and the characters were poping, you can easily distinguish them from the yet gorgeous backgrounds with no problems.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nMore Kougami = more music to the ear.\r\nSome people forget why Kougami is so good, it's not just because he is a well-written character, but also the seiyuu behind him does such an incredible job at conveying the dialogs he part-takes in.\r\nAgain, with the first opening theme song, it's just so good, I keep burning in nostalgia as soon as the first note hits me. And of course, the OSTs, adding even more delicious topping to an already delicious cake.\n\r\nCharacter (8.5/10):\r\nI guess you know it already, the fan-favorite Kougami takes the stage, what else? Character-wise, this was a fan service fest that everybody loved. The setting that focused on linking Kougami back to the main plotline added some restrictions of any attempts at character development, but you could argue that him deciding to go back home at the end is development in on itself.\r\nThe main villain I'd argue was the weakest character in this movie; he didn't really manage to catch you and have you notice him much, in fact, some lesser impactful characters easily took off his highlight for themselves.\r\nFrederica, in the last movie, struck me with a fishy unwelcoming attire, you could tell something about her was just dangerous and unlikeable, however, surprisingly enough, this movie flips that upside down without any warning.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nGreat movie. I did not expect much but I was proven wrong, and I like when that happens, I guess more budget was thrown into this project than the other two for a reason.\r\nI really enjoyed this one, it felt like an unreleased portion of the very first Psycho-Pass movie that we're finally getting to see. \r\nI enjoyed the whole sit through, it felt like a standard Anime episode whilst in reality spanning over an hour, ending up on the perfect note with enough hype and excitement for the third season.\n\r\nOverall (8.64/10):\r\nWatch it. Seriously, even if you have to skip the first two movies, which I still think are great on their own, especially the second one, this one however just blows them out of the water.\r\nIf you're a Psycho-Pass fan, check. If you love your crispy animation, super check. If you love your Kougami, I mean, watch it, jus- just watch it.\n"
