It makes sense now.\r\nThe pistol trailer felt like saying something, but it lacked the ability to speak, but this one felt more like the complete version of the previous one.\n\r\nThe addition of colors was a massive help, and the music was also bombing. The dialogue this time made sense with the addition of the lead female voice, it finally alluded to something. Although I gotta say, it made for a better standing as a trailer for some upcoming show than as the trailer for the game it was doomed to represent.\n              "
