This is not a sequel or a prequel but rather just extra content that you may insert at some point from watching the series, so the order doesn't really matter that much, at least watchthis after the beach episodes. Masamune-kun no Revenge was a series that hasn't aged well in my memory aside from its plot idea of revenge, I couldn't recall any character names or chronological order to keep up along, but it didn't stop me from enjoying this short.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nThe OVA follows three different stories with different contexts resolving around friends and family.\r\nThe first was looking at Masamune meeting his Aunt that looks exactly like his loli mother, and that has a daughter that's just as prominent as her. The trio goes as far as annoying the heck out of the protagonist giving him a hard time telling them apart.\r\nThen came the second snapshot that focused on his female classmates going on a beach vacation without him, having fun at the beach, trying swimsuits (there is always room for fanservice) and doing some girly stuff.\r\nThe third and the last was, in my opinion, the most deserving out of the bunch, it follows Yoshino probably for the first time dressing and having a princess makeup, she goes through a monologue for the most part on why she feels so empty and lonely most of the time.\r\nThose where some pretty basic side stories to get to know the characters more, probably setting up for a near sequel.\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\r\nI've never had problems with the art in this franchise, the girls look cute, the anatomy isn't dragged on and the movements feel normal.\r\nI like the details the put on the characters' eyes, they give way more personality to them and even back up the statement \u201cThe eyes are mirrors of the soul\u201d pretty well. The use of vibrant colors is never disappointing if used right.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nI never lose it when talking about sound acting in shows like this, the more pitches a loli voice gets the more transparent it becomes to me to take seriously. The only thing I really feel nostalgic about is the opening theme song, I don't know why the ending one never clicked to me though.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nIt was nice to see a buildup for characters, especially Yushino, they all feel like they went through a massive change from what I can remember, it's stories like these that level up characters, giving us their motives really helps. But then again, the cast is not a small one, and not everybody is having the same treatment, I'd say at most it's always Masamune, Aki, and Yoshino.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nThe ride was all... Meh. I didn't expect more to be honest, but it was enough to stop me from sighing from boredom. I don't consider myself as a hardcore fan of the series, or even the genre, but I still had a catch from watching this, and I only expect people that like this sort of stuff to love this, but still it's not mandatory to see. The shorts do not contribute to the main plot so it all feels like a select of fillers disguised under a 23 minutes OVA.\n\r\n- Overall (6.9/10):\r\nI don't see this aging any better than the main franchise, I feel like the trend has toned down quite a bit so this might not be as prominent as it may have been a year ago. I nonetheless had my share of swimsuit sighting for the day, so I beg your pardon.\n"
