The fandom is mostly quote, and has been ever since the movie was out, but then, the trilogy SS Case movies were announced, and season 3 announcement followed shortly.\n\r\nSeason 2 left quite the bad taste in our tongue, and as much as we all wanted more of Psycho-Pass, we saw the trilogy as a filter fan service that we're not that much afraid ofto further taint the reputation of the franchise, but then, the third season just confirmed a canonical follow up to the story. The fans were afraid that it would suck, worst-case scenario, more than season two even did, but hopefully, it did not.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nTo a barebone level, Psycho-Pass 3 tackles the same action detective thriller that makes up the identity of the franchise. It tries to apt-up the stakes to new grounds, it expands on everything presented on the earlier entries, however, it felt like it overwhelmed itself in its own lore and complex world that it's visible on the confused pacing it runs on. At times, it feels like the slowest slice of life out there with convoluted dialogue and boring background, but in other times it's head-on a sonic incarnation, lots of stuff happening and constant cut-outs to different places and times, it definitely requires more attention and effort to follow than it makes for an enjoyable watch. It feels like a chore.\r\nAlso, the whole supernatural telekinesis wizardry was a big cheat no-no for me.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nPsycho-Pass has always had a consistent delivery when it came to the visuals, I mean, the studio behind it is a pretty capable one.\n\r\nI feel like with this third season, it only reaffirmed how consistent it is visually, while it added nothing new to the formula, I would say it's just as good as it's ever looked. I guess the art style they go with doesn't allow for much, the realistic depiction of anatomy and environment is probably it's biggest quirk and restriction at the same time.\n\r\nCGI has been utilized so much in the series that sometimes, the drawings would make up no more than 30% of the scene's composition, however, while not the best, it never looks too horrible, aside from the city-opened environment.\n\r\nSound (8.8/10):\r\nAgain, hitting us with an absolute party banger for an opening, the song is classy, and the visuals couldn't be more faithful to what we're used to.\r\nThe ending theme song is also just as good, very emotional, and nostalgic in a way.\r\nThe voice acting is, good. I wouldn't say spectacular just because talents like Seki Tomokazu, Sakurai Takahiro, Arimoto Kinryuu, and Hanazawa Kana were barely present if at all.\r\nThe OG OST makes frequent returns which us always a plus in my book.\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\r\nLet's just agree that the first season, in both protagonists and antagonists, set up a skyscraping standard no just for its franchise but in the industry. Unfortunately, season two could not live up to that hype, and probably that was its biggest weakness, however, season three, along with the prequel trilogy did hammer it down to a decent degree.\n\r\nArata and Kei are a good addition to the rooster, however, they lack something. Arata is a fun character, very easy-going, and looks very approachable, with Kei being more of a \u201cmeh\u201d mannequin, at least for the first half of the show until he receives proper focus and development.\n\r\nThe appearance of Kougami and Akane felt more like fanservice cameos than functioning members of the plot that can alter the events at display.\r\nI would say Mika has found some redemption, not as close to being dislikable as she was in the second season, but maybe because she had minimal screentime herself.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.2/10):\r\nIf it weren't for the cherry experience, man, this would have been closed the first season. Not until the last 3 or so episodes, it did not have that defining Psycho-Pass mark, so the overwhelming majority of it felt very far from home. Another drawback, or at least for me, is the length of the episodes, I would have had an easier time if it followed the generic 24 minutes episode, because man does it become crazy and hard to follow given its 45 minutes length.  And then there is the ending.\n\r\nOverall (7.6/10):\r\nWell, I guess, we did ask for more, I would say if you have the same mindset, go for it. However, I would also say, it is more difficult to follow and complex compared to what we're used to from the franchise, maybe because it's one giant case all through, unlike the \u201cmini-cases that turn out to be related\u201d kind of progression.\r\nI mean, Kougami, there you go. Although, don't expect a full-on fashion screening from him.\n"
