    "content": "\n                This epilogue felt like a good send-off for the side characters and island in general introduced in the second MHA movie. Basically, a picture drama cycling through all of those Goodbyes, giving us a peek at the aftermath of what happened on the island.\n\r\nIt was a bit hard, I don't know how they do it, but My Hero Academia is really good at selling you off these arc-tied characters, even for the 2 hours length we spent with them, Mahoro and get brother really felt like they were there to stay.\n\r\nAll in all could have been better, presentation-wise, I'm not the biggest fan of picturedramas, but I have seen some better ones for sure. For anyone wondering, think of picture dramas as slideshows with voiceover.\n"
