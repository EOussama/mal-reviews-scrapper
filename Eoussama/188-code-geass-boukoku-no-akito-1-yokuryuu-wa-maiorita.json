One of if not the most delayed movies I had on my to-watch list, so unreal that it's almost if not already 4 years since I set myself to watch it, and today it was the day.\r\nMarathoning through the OVA/ONA/Specials/Movies/Spin-offs/etc of shows that I had watched before, making sure I don't miss on anything, I was so happy that it was finally the Akito movies who were standing in the queue line.\r\nNow, I have watched a few of the OVAs that connect to the story of Code Geass before diving in, which only filled me with more excitement afterremembering and refreshing my memory on the plotline. Akito came just in time to offer even more of an expansion on the world that surrounded the main story.\n\r\nI dove in almost blind, which was surprising for me when I found out that Lelouch is probably not going to take part in any of those, but who knows, he may make a cameo appearance, and God, please let that happen, along with a few if not all of the major characters from the parent series. If I understand correctly, this is set in the time frame that took place in between season 1 and season 2. Lelouch is probably now held captive, and thus, Akito an Eleven that sparks Lelouch and Suzaku vibes is taking the main lead. Along with his commander Leila (A Britanian aristocrat), and a few other Eleven.\r\nWithout putting too many credits on Akito, he does not scale to the complexity that both Lelouch and Suzaku display, but it's also worth noting that this is one the first entry out of 5 movies in total, so it might be still too early to judge his character indefinitely.\n\r\nThe action that made a great part of Code Geass was present, luckily. I forgot how fast-paced and intense the fights were. It's so blooded thrilling to see an exchange of raw mecha punches, gigantic swords waving left and right, and bursts of lethal firearms that hit at all directions. And even when the pilots leave off their nightmares, they can certainly impress with they fast and precise hand-to-hand combat mastery. It's very safe to say that this movie does not disappoint from an Animation stand of point.\n\r\nThe music was also good, the voice acting left nothing to be desired, you know something is good and working as it should when you don't feel the need to bash on it. While not phenomenal, it delivered an enjoyable deal of vocal fun. That was a weird way to phrase it.\n\r\nDefinitely excited to see more of this. Of course, it's not yet on the level of the parent show, but it could go either way, it's still only an opening for a greater plot, and I shall only see for myself when it all ends.\n"
