    "content": "\n                Sukuwareru Ramiris,\" was a fun and enjoyable watch for fans of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken. Clocking in at just 2 minutes per episode, it packs a lot of content into a small package. The focus on Ramiris training the kids with Rimuru was a nice change of pace from the main series, as it gave us a chance to see the lovable Ramiris in a different light.\n\r\nThe animation quality was on par with the main series, with bright and colorful visuals that were easy on the eyes. The voice acting was also top-notch, with the actors bringing their characters to life in a waythat was true to the source material.\n"
