Not going to lie, before watching the series, and before reading the synopsis even, all I had was its cheesy cover art screaming of JRPG with nothing appealing to it on the surface, a mediocre poster at best, but why does it have such a dope name I wonder, asked silly past me. Something that's close to this that I'm familiar with was the movie \u201cInception\u201d, I remembered how itblew my mind back in the day and was hoping for something similar, but not until I spot the \u201charem\u201d tag on the genre board. Of course, it's a harem with JRPG setting, could it be just another one of those Isekai we get tons of each season? But then I read the synopsis and everything changed...\n\r\nStory (2/10):\r\nLet's start like every other Isekai, Itsuki, and Mahiru, two cousins get dragged away into this magical looking world in the middle of a serious confession and put into a quest of saving the world. Pretty basic, and I would argue that a lot of readers' minds autocompleted that by something like \u201cthe typical protagonist will have to train harder and become more powerful in order to defeat the big baddy in an intense fight to the death\u201d, No. nothing of that. He actually has to bang 12 maidens and get them to bear his children in order to save the world, sounds unpractical on paper, but believe me, they made it work.\r\nThe story itself has no sense of development and relies more on comedy and erotic interactions (exactly what you'd expect from a harem), there were some cool concepts (Conception? I know it's not funny, I'll stop) like referencing the zodiac signs, it really helped expand the lore a certain bit.\r\nIt took me personally ages to get that I even had to rant over why he named one of his children \u201ccancer\u201d, my mind willingly took the more controversial road on that one.\r\nI don't think there was any serious-worthy moment in the show as occasionally, you can notice the sudden change of tone to a mildly interesting and sad perspective while explaining some of the character's backstories, only for them to discard every effort they put to sell them out and end up ruining not only those characters but entire episodes, something I hated the most about Conception. Add to that the questionable choice of characters that come in all shapes and sizes, makes you question the ethics of watching this Anime, and keep in mind, that he has to bang all of theme.\r\nFrom a sexy nurse to an equally hot secretary, the keep going on a solid preference list until they hit the no-go-land by introducing some as underaged girls that probably have no idea what's their role going to be in the show. And let's add to that the incest figure that it Itsuki's cousin, they're really going all out here, or did I forget the gay-ish paring as well, where he has to temporarily check out some guys to hook with for some reason? and let's not forget the part where he screws a raccoon for all of those furry fans' sake, screw this show.\n\r\nArt (6/10):\r\nSpeaking of the animation, as in, the animated frames, quality of movements and everything that takes part in producing \u201csolid\u201d movements. I wouldn't call this a strong point of Conception, it really looks like the product of not a very high budget but still holds enough to get you staring at the screen.\r\nWhat I really appreciate, however, are the character designs, so we have those two individuals who arrived from a world that's supposed to be the real world we're living at. They look pretty much painfully averagely looking people, they don't stand out too much from the crowd nor do they have your typical main character visual treats, I bet you'd mistake them being mains from other characters in the background, that's how averagely looking they are. But what Conception did great was the designs of these maidens from the new magical world, they do autocomplete their origins and on their own have some of the greatest character designs I've seen this season, however, that's not speaking of them all but still the majority of them.\n\r\nSound (7/10):\r\nAt least they went easy on your ears. Some of the cast (not all) have great voice actors behind them looking at how mildly big the cast is, you're bound to found some of your favorites here, I know I was pleased with Reone's voice actress (Yamaguchi Yuriko, the same actress behind Robin from One Piece).\r\nI really enjoyed both the opening and theme songs, speaking a whole lot about the opening, but not so much for the soundtrack, if they were there in the first place, it seems I've spent a lot of my watch time facepalming than focusing of the plot of the series.\n\r\nCharacters (4/10):\r\nIt really is a shame for great character designs to fall under such blunt characters, characters that don't bring anything new to the table rather than being there to look cute and make for waifu material, and without a doubt, some of them do make for great waifus, but no amount of waifu-ism can save an adaptation this bad.\r\nItsuki a character that's hardly relatable, even though one of the selling points of most of the harem shows is making the protagonist relatable to most of the audience in a way, I probably got his name just because I'm writing this review only minutes later after watching the last episode of the show, that should be forgotten by the end of the day no doubt. There was this character I liked with yellow hair, he had great design and cheerful karma around him, so disappointed he was put to the side.\r\nAside from great characters, there was an individual who unbelievably reeks of annoyance, a cursed talking raccoon that more perverted than him my eyes have never seen who doesn't shut up on explaining obvious jokes and spams sexual references like a Vietnam machinegun, it really starts out very annoying and ends out even more annoying. Like man, screw Mana to death.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nThere it is, and I'm not ashamed of it, it seems as trashy this Anime is, and I'm fully aware of how truly bad it is, I just couldn't seem to act like I never enjoyed it, horrible storytelling aside, I really feel like the show itself was pretty self-aware of how bad it sucked, it even kept throwing fourth-wall breaking jokes in the aim of roasting itself, for me, it was more of a semi-cringy comedy serialization with harem elements to it, having \u201csex\u201d as its only selling point, a lot of people hate it just for that and never bother giving it a chance.\r\nI do believe it's got the most stupid and awful ending ever, I've never seen such a horrible way to end a series before, but it remains as a decent comedy stand up, if only they focused more on that and ignored the shallow plot they set up at first.\n\r\nOverall (5.4/10):\r\nWithout a doubt, not my proudest watch, but also not my worst. I'm confident enough that I'll be rewatching this abomination, not for the plot this time, but more for the giggles in the future, yes it's trash, but if only people gave it a chance as a not so serious comedy series and spared all the fuss about the plot's inconsistency they would genuinely get some fun time, it's filled with fanservice of course, to the point you'd think this was way better off released on a site like HentaiHeaven or something, Highschool DxD has set off a record to what defines an Icchi and what's straight out Hentai, and Conception was near that fine line.\n"
