    "content": "\n                Bleach is a weird series, it has so many fans and way too little content, especially compared to the rest of the big three. Out of the only three OVA episodes, this one had it the most with the most boring and convoluted villain of the week that gets both introduced and nerfed in the same episode, somewhat, an analogy of what every unnecessarily long filler arc in the series should have been. Looking at you \u201cThe New Captain Amagai\u201d arc.\n\r\nThe animation was inconsistent with what the quality of the art offered, the music is good but utilized badly, sometimes not matching the tone ofthe scenes they were layered on top of. However the comedy was nailed, Renji handling a shotgun at the beginning is now one of the comedic highlights of the entire series.\n"
