With this out of the way, let me expand on this more.\n\r\nI, unlike many people, fell off early on the first season, the content was just that generic at best to me, the characters did not interest me in theslightest and the power system, while pretty, did not tingly anything inside of me, and the biggest miss was the finale of the first season, we get introduced to so many new characters that even the ones we spent an entire season with didn't even warm up to me for me to care about any new faces, HOWEVER, Mugan Train changed everything.\n\r\nThis arc was sort of a re-introduction to the whole series, I got to appreciate Tanjiro and the trio more for what they arc, not only that, but Rengoku went from a nobody to one of if not the best characters in the show in the span of one arc.\n\r\nAs this was basically a chopped-off version of the movie, the animation and how breathtakingly glorious it was persisted its quality, with some new direction changes introduced as additional camera angles and slight touches here and there, it did not fall out of the place. If the second season segmented this franchise as an eye cake, this sequel added more topping.\r\nI must also talk about the opening and ending theme songs, never disappoint Ufotable, never disappoint.\n\r\nOverall: 8.2/10\n"
