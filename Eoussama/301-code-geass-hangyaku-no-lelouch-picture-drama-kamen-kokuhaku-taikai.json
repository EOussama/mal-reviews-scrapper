    "content": "\n                I don't know what's with Code Geass and cheap non-ending picture drama, calling it that at this point is just a sorry excuse at promoting slideshows.\n\r\nJust when you think you've seen it now, MAL promotes you with yet another one to sink time into watching, but fine, it's Code Geass, the majority of the characters are likable enough to bear watching repetitively.\n\r\nNothing worth noting happens in this one, the folks tease Lelouch about exposing his Zero persona, and of course, love declarations left and rights accompanied with screaming and steering.\r\nThe art was nice enough to keep along, the sort of stuff you'd see on abootleg One Piece Treasure Cruise ripoff, I wish some recognizable OSTs from the main series were used, other than that, there's nothing more to say.\n"
