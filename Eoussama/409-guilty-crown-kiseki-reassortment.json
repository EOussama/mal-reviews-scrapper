I mean, I'll give credit where credit is due, the first 11 episodes of Guilty Crown were actually pretty decent. But then again, so was the first season of Dexter. And we all know how that turned out.\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, the Kiseki - Reassortment special was a nice reminder of the good old days when the story was still somewhat coherent and the characters had actual depth and development. It's a shame that the rest of the show couldn't liveup to the promise of these early episodes. But hey, at least we have this one-hour special to remind us of what could have been.\n"
