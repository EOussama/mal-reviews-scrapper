    "content": "\n                This week's episode of One Piece was a recap of the epic clash between King and Zoro, one of the most anticipated fights of the Wano arc. The episode showed us once again how badass Zoro is, as he sliced through King's fire attacks and even managed to cut his mask off, almost revealing his face for the first time. We also got to see some flashbacks of Zoro's bond with his swords. The episode was narrated by Sanji and Chopper, the latter was the only one who didn't get drawn in a cute chibi style like the rest of the narrators. Maybe it's becausehe's already too adorable, or maybe it's because he's a doctor and needs to be serious. Either way, he did a great job of explaining the details of the fight and hyping us up for the next episode. The episode ended with a cliffhanger, as Zoro prepared to unleash his ultimate attack on King, who was still determined to stop him. Next week, we will finally see the conclusion of this epic battle, and I can't wait to witness Zoro's victory. I'm ready to feast on his glory. This episode was a great reminder of why Zoro is one of the best characters in One Piece, and why we love him so much. I hope it's adapted at least as half-good as last week's episode. We Wanji fans feasted like kings.\n"
