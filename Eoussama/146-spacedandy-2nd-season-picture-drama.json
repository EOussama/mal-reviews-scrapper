    "content": "\n                Well, we can all at least agree that one can not simply get enough Dandy, and picture dramas are just there to fulfill your demands, while not on the same quality production-wise, it does make for a great topping for the parent series, if you're a true fan, you'd appreciate the abstract bizarre irony that is Dandy.\r\nThese 6 minutes long pieces of animation that mainly consisted of slideshows of still figures from the parent show with a surprisingly decent voice acting (Too bad no DUB for us, probably never) that fills the cake. The art direction wasn't nearly as good as we're used to, butit serves the goal of the special.\n"
