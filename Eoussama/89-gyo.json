I've watched a good one hour of this stinky crap so you don't have to, everything I dislike about a show was packed in here like an old tuna tin, especially the core idea. The thing is, Anime can be random, so random, in fact, that anything you can think of has already been animated and made into its own thing. But random doesn't always mean bad, however, Gyo was so random and stupid it might be the worst thing I've ever put interest into. Gore and excessive sexualreferences don't make a bad show better, other more important aspects do, but then again, it neither rains gold nor do fish walk on land... or do they? enter Gyo.\n\r\n- Story (2/10):\r\nIt starts up like any other chich\u00e9 low budget copy-past horror show ever. The university graduates set off for a vacation in other to celebrate their graduation, until, of course, \u201cthe bad guy\u201d triggers the suspense sound effects and have the roll harder than your ears can bear. But this time around, it's not your average serial killer clown or a ghost of any respect, and please quote me on this, \u201cJapan never disappoints\u201d, it's a walking fish! Never have I face-palmed that hard before. A fish peeping on the girls making a stalky expression, and it olay gets weirder that's it's not a fish, no no no, bitconneeee--, sorry, got carried away there. You also get cows, dogs, and all sorts of animals, humans included, on mechanical legs crawling the spider way. They later throw at you some world war II lore in a desperate excuse to make up for the stupid sight of seeing sea creature violating humans on land (of course there is room for your typical octopus tentacle sexual strangling). It's hard to buy that, given the stupidity you get exposed to the entirety of the movie. The only positive thing for me was the pacing, the focus alternates simultaneously between both parties, showing a lot of either side, plus, I can always appreciate a flow that is nimble and efficient on what it presents no matter how bad it is, that's what we call \u201ccalm and classy\u201d.\n\r\n- Art (4.5/10):\r\nI reconsidered my rating on this one a lot. The thing is, among the 2D Anime art style, it was one of the best I've seen. You get reasonable human anatomy for once, people's faces are a lot more like real people's. The gory stuff felt-like gore!! They've put so much work into that, however, the horrible CGI struck hard.\r\nIt was almost some kind of visual torture. Not only the 3D animations are whacky and out of place, but the shading was also just as bad. Having the camera shift around and zoom constantly on the yet horrible 3D models made they low-resolution textures feel a lot painful to look at, I could swear I was able to count the pixels in front of me comfortably.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nSurprisingly enough, my ears haven't complained as much as my eyes did. From what I ranted about, you can tell how clich\u00e9 and stupid my experience was, but as for the audio work, it was in a whole separate dimension parallel to that of the rest of the movie. The sound effects were very classic and dramatic, they made for the perfect seasoning for this abomination. The entire movie was an insult to the excellent voice acting and involving soundtracks.\n\r\n- Character (3/10):\r\nHypothetically speaking (because spiting of this words, I might end up in some mental facility before I know it), if those characters were to exists in real life, they would have a lower survival rate than the average toddler. Not only are they cursed by the fate of continuously tripping down and making bad decisions in the times of panic, but are so stupid that they decided to sleep at the house that they have commented so many times to be smelling of dead bodies, and even seeing a walking fish didn't switch their logical gates once. But then again, that's far from being reality, \u201cwalking fish\u201d am I right?!!\r\nA quick loop over the main characters would print the following; A screaming \u201cI'm a main\u201d (Kaori), your perfect university graduate, with good health and good manners, has a fianc\u00e9 and looks the most successful out of the bunch, too naive to the story she leads. You have an unconfident overweight minority (Aki), she's the type that gets bullied for every bit of air she breaths. And lastly, a horrible friend that f*** every moving body she spots (Erika). Only stating those had me overheat my head from frustration.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (4/10):\r\nA big NOPE for me, I remember seeing clips of the movie back in the day and laughing off how stupid walking fish looked, I never thought I'd ever spend an hour looking at the same clips only getting way more awkward. I can safely say, this hasn't been a pleasant experience for me, the whole walking fish (sharks roaming the cities) was hard to take seriously as it took a lot of immersion from my experience. I would still confess though that I was a bit interested in hearing an explanation behind this nonsense, but was severely disappointed and betrayed to the core.\n\r\n- Overall (4.3/10):\r\nI would never recommend this for people who demand something of true enjoyment, a contest of the worst movies out there? why not. Watching this out of curiosity would be pointless and won't resolve anything, the ending is both oblivious and solves nothing. If you cherish your time and hate to waste it on nothing, please avoid watching this, for watching it come doom and regret. I would be willing to see this with close friends whom I'd rather make fun and criticize this out of the heck of it but as a solid piece of storytelling? It's anything but that.\n"
