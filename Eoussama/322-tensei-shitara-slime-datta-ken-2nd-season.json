The series has always left dark hints here and there but the wholesome slimy boy made us easily overlook them and think of the portrayed world as a magical haven where many laughs and goofs are shared and the evil is only an exaggerated form of a coping mechanism for the opposing sides, however, the nail has been hit so perfectly in the midst of suspense that the series solidifies its dark reach and grasp of its own story, no afraid of shifting the mood and vibes it made us comfortable with for a season and a half.\n\r\nCharacterization was a big part of what made Tensura 2 great, Rimumru, for instance, received a massive upgrade/change to what we've been seeing him as, so great that it overshadows everything else. A character development that feels like someone snapping out after many attempts of calming down and thinking logically, a very realistic reaction for what led it to happen. But without leading into any spoilers, let's leave it at that.\n\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (8.2/10)\r\nSound (8/10)\r\nCharacters (8/10)\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\r\nOverall (8.24/10)\n"
