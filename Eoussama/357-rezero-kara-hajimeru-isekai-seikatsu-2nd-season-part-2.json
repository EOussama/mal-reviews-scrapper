Although, not as bad as the first party was, and also not as good as season one.\n\r\nHHad both parts made up one collection season, I have a feeling that it would have been received better with more entertainment and joy to deliver. A huge reason for this is how this part lacked a lot of build-ups that depended on the previous part while the latter lacked any sort of sensible resolution.\n\r\nMultiple characters had a resolution to their personal inner conflicts, it brought about peace and tranquility and help clear up the fuzzy image that the series hadsince it started, now, the finish line is clearer, and the goal is undistracted and ready for more exposition.\n\r\nWhat really made this part stand out, even more than season one, is how all beneficial were side/supporting characters that achieved development to the highest degrees, while Subaru stood on the sideline and kept watch, not to say he did not develop himself, but compared to how much he was able to upgrade his flaws by an amount of time, this time, it was overshadowed by how great everyone else shined.\n\r\nReally, I can't stress enough how great of a care everyone got, fan favorites, underrated characters, it didn't matter how important they were, they are now a better version of themselves.\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10\n"
