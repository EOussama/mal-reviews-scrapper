The show has been in the dark for decades before a continuation was announced, yes, you heard it, this is a sequel to a two seasons series from the early 2000s, the dated animation might scare some people away, but please, give it a chance before proceeding to watch this season.\n\r\nThat aside, if you just wanna jump in to get a better grasp of the memes, then knock yourself out, this show is a minefield for memes, almost every line ofdialogue mocks common sense in all sorts of metrics until you realize you're watching Baki, a show that invites you to open your head, grab your brain out, seat it next to you and shares a bowl of popcorn over a streamline of episodes, it is that simple and unassuming.\n\r\nFrom a personal telescope, it appears that Baki, as a character, loses a lot of character that you see him develop in the earlier two seasons, he's a walking empty sell, hungry for fights and lacking principle, slowly falling under the emo trend that carries no special depth, which is a shame considering the character development he received up until this point, it's almost as a soft reboot for his character.\n\r\nWhat's better than Baki though, is the return of all of the loved familiar faces, characters we thought were one-offs make a comeback and fill you with joy and excitement every time they are on screen, making you sheer for them and care about them more so than you'd do about the main character. In addition to that, some of the newly introduced characters make for some of the best ones in the entire series, it's shocking how a show that doesn't take itself seriously like Baki is able to flip the switch in an instance and present a rooster full of strongly willed, interestingly conflicted characters that waver between good and evil, making it easy for the viewers to sympathize and like them.\n\r\nProbably the most visible enhancement from this sequel is undoubtedly the animation, although the arc looked a tad weird coming from the older seasons, they still pay a huge deal of loyalty to the original art of the Manga. Although I'm still raising an eyebrow over some questionable CGI placements, that brought about nightmarish memories of that opening from the older seasons.\n\r\nIt's very known that Baki is not the type of show that might have you reflecting upon life, praise for masterful writing, or make examples out of, and even if it was, no judging you, but one can't deny how entertaining this airhead of a show can really be most of the times. Which all of its drawbacks, it hosts some of the most hype fights in anime, and this is no overstatement.\n\r\nOverall: 7.9\n"
