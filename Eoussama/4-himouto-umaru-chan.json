I really was expecting some fan service but we were clean after all, I'm actually glad they didn't include such emphasis, and hey, let's move to the bigger picture now.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nWhile not exceptional, it really holds up to this kind of shows, the animation is not bad by any means. the character designs were on point, no excessive use of still imagery, so that'sa plus.\n\r\n- Characters (7.5/10):\r\nThere aren't so many characters, to be honest, but for this short show, it does have some excuses, but, the characters that we have do differ a great deal, their personalities and even design is enough to distinguish them apart, but weirdly enough, there was a lack of character development for the main cast, in the other hand, side characters did change throughout the story, the likes of Ebina and Kirie.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nAbsolutely nothing remarkable, vague even for a slice of life anime, the story doesn't progress, but then again it shouldn't, the score would have been much lower if it weren't for some serious moments every now and then, like the past between Taihei and that girl from his work...etc.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nYes, if there is something I absolutely adore in this show, is the adorable itself soundtracks, those little symphonies that play in the background ahhhh, man, it really adds in a big difference.\r\nThe opening is very, very good, I can also say that it was one of the reasons I even stuck to this show in the first place, The ending while not very bad, does get familiar.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI've had this on my to-watch-list for a very long tile now, and as any of the shows that are still collecting dust there to this very day, I was afraid that it would turn into a complete disappointment, but NO!!\r\nLiterally, a very cheerful comedy slice of life, I mainly enjoyed the huge among of references, especially the \u201cOne Piece\u201d ones.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nWould I recommend this? Not for everyone, It's for those people who had watched enough anime, read enough manga to be able to get that cheer among of references because honestly, the good part of the comedy in this show comes from the crazy references to other works.\n"
