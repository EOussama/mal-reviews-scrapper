Gangsta. Recap; also called episode 9.5, came with the mindset of acting against those claims and making it a bit easier on the memory to process everything that has happened so far. Just like what \u201c91 Days\u201d did, it was a brief look on the first 9 episodes of the main series to give more clarification on certaincharacters, and explain their connection in a more narrative way.\n\r\n- Story (6.5/10):\r\nTalking here about how the recap handled the retelling of the story, and not on the main strong progression. This honestly felt like a very short episode although sharing the same length with the others, the information presented kept consistent, in a more linear way, they went from introducing every character out there to presenting each faction's motives and hinting at their intentions. In term of the story itself, there wasn't much to praise, I would actually argue this was more of a character centered episode than showing actual events.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nHow I love the art style in this one, it suits the crime genre a whole lot, the gore was just on point, you don't see people splashing fountains of blood when cut or anything. The fight scenes are always very exciting even if they are not major battles. I just love the anatomy and faces expressions. 95% of the animations where clips reused from older episodes, but why I'm going to complain when they looked so good either way.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nThe voice acting was just spot on, Nicolas deprecated voice sounds so realistic and in character, Alex actually sounds like a desperate ex-prostitute with more on her mind than she actually lets out. The ending and opening theme songs that they kept from the main story were above average to very good.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nThe main trio are all likable in their own way, Nicolas, as a deaf ice-cold killing machine that has gone through a lot than my tears can hold for was always a source of sympathy, the lost soul of Alex, as someone who has nowhere to go made it easier for us, the viewers, to understand her sadness. And then there is the guy who ties them all up together, Worick, a guy too kind for their cruel world. In this recap, they went through reminding us of the major plot points consisting those three, and even went ahead and talked about the cop duo, Dr. Theo and his assistance, all of the known four fathers members and leaders, and even the Tabacco shop clerk, the granny and her granddaughter. I feel like they should have gone deeper with the characters and picking on stuff in their past, but looking at the limited length of the episode, I can close an eye on that.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nFor me as someone who didn't binge watch this show, the recap was a vital decision that refreshed a whole lot of information that I either slept off on or forgot. Seeing how we're closing to the end of the series, it would be good to have as much awareness of the story as possible.\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\r\nIf you're already fully concentrated and following the story with a great face, being it a binge watch or not, you won't really miss out much on this recap, but in case you really are lost and confused about all sort of aspects of the show, this one was just a splendid reminder of so many things, like going as far as redefining what a Twilight means, what's the Celebrer drug and so on.\n"
