    "content": "\n                For a movie with such a vulgar title, you'd think it belongs to the infamous Isekai trash light-novel circlejerk of adaptations that we nowadays see a bunch of, every single season, but as Bunny Girl Senpai taught us, a title is merely clickbait for what can be an amazing rollercoaster of a story.\n\r\nThe story plays like a typical slice-of-life drama with a generic set of characters that feel like inanimate theater props, however, the heartfelt story being told breaths enough life into them, making them true to their-selves and life-like characters that one can relate to.\n\r\nThe animations weren't necessarily on par with what you'd expectfrom a modern big-screen release, but it was levels beyond what your typical TV series can deliver on a consistent pace. The colors were a tad bit washed out, but they highlighted the sickly nature and desperation that the characters were going through.\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, real, and genuine, the slightest voice crack could force a stream of tears out of you, the faintest tingle from the OST's notes can send shivers down every pore from your body, it was simply an experience in and of its own.\n\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (8.5/10)\r\nSound (8/10)\r\nCharacters (7/10)\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10)\r\nOverall (8/10)\n"
