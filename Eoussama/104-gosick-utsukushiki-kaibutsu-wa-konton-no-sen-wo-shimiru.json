Regarded sometimes as the 10.5 episode that goes midway in the show.\n\r\nThe first half was all animation from the parent show, recapping the first half with minor but crucial details, so a lot of spoilers are expected forthat matter, while at the end teasing what's coming up ahead, so it's still a dangerous territory even then, and probably the best time to watching this is after finishing the series.\n\r\nThe second half of the episode introduced some of the key voice actresses and actors, featuring them in a miniature game of questions in a fun and engaging atmosphere.\n\r\nIt wasn't that great in the bigger picture, but it was still better than nothing.\r\nIn case you were anxious to find the episode somewhere to find, just google \u201cGosick Recap\u201d and go fetch it on the video tab. The biggest problem there is the lack of reliable subs if at all. Or simply go with the harder option of switching the Youtube's auto-generated English subs, the ones that gave me a hard time throwing at me all of those vague translations the lakes of \u201cI am a boys and not Vikutoriko boobie\u201d, that's genuinely the line and exactly how it was spelled. Youtube, please fix.\n"
