Hot canned curry and Zombies, why would you ask for anything else, right? Maybe that was the point behind another genius marketing ploy that goes unnoticed anyways, the sights of seeing the rotten girls bloom instantly into their idol fashioned after a mere interaction with the soup is a promising feat, but seeing ho clip baiting has evolved with time, it can't be helped but maintain the natural frown of disappointment tat fills you as soon as you give up on an advertised product.\n\r\nIt is stuff like this thatbrings joy to fans of a certain show, making you believe that more content is incoming as a marketing department won't simply approach any other show to associate their brand with. Zombieland Saga has certainly left its mark in the industry, and with the coming for the second season, it would even grow more popular, probably mirroring te ^popularity of the main characters in their world.\n"
