Running my fingers across the keyboard, dramatically sliding my index from one side to the other while magically still type down a comprehensible sentence as my intense sweat evaporates into sparkles. Writing has never looked so intense before, such is the wonder of this majestic OST, and the latter is only a fragment from what the masterpiece called \u201cDeath Note\u201d can offer.\r\nIt's undeniable that the show at review is probably one of the founding pillars of mainstream Anime, it has almost becomea rule of thumb among the classics such as Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, and Trigun that every Anime fan should at least give a chance to. Those shows specifically always infiltrate discussions that goe about saying that older shows are the supreme, and the new Isekai/Shounen trashy guilty pleasure is what your typical \u201cnormie\u201d would be into. And that's a terrible form of gatekeeping.\n\r\nRecaps come in all shapes and forms, mostly ending up being horrendously bad and unfaithful to the original, but never have I seen better-executed processing of recapping in the Anime medium, that I was so eager to dive in as soon as it was ReWiNd TiMe.\r\nThe OST in death note is one of the best, and have not seen the show in ages, probably what approximate to 3 to 4 years now, it was a shame that it was beginning to fade away from my memory, so much so that hearing it again for the first time triggered massive nostalgia and thriller to being back again, and don't get me started on the phenomenal voice acting too, the characters are so much felt, those of a presence that tells a genuine story, carry strong emotion, and their fear of death resonates with even your own.\n\r\nFor some reason, the visual credibility of the original show had me in constant fear of there being a great deal of age, after all, I only got to experience it for the first time in probably crappy 480p, potato sound output and horrible latency. But now that I have managed to lay my fingers on this almost remaster-felt pie, I appreciated more the fact that it came from no other than the fantastic folks over at MadHouse, it really shows even with over a decade from it first being serialized.\n\r\nOne of the most controversial parts in the fandom is the fight over which the superior part of the series was best, the L arc, or L's successors' arc. I would personally go always for L's arc and this recap shows it clearly to me again. Both episodes were solid retrospective re-telling of the story, but the first one had me head over heels in awes.\r\nA total gem that's 100% worthy of many rewatches. Although it does not justify skipping over the parent show as you could only fit so much in a 3-something hours total of recap material.\n"
