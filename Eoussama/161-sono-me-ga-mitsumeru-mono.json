Just money hungry 15 seconds long commercial for some eye drop of some sort, I did no research prior to this, but I still can't get the reasoning behind choosing a franchise like One Piece to associate with some eye drop product.\r\nI thought the animation was kind of weird, except for Usopp, the rest had a dumb look on their face and it almost was intentional.\r\nYou'd at least ask for a more original commercial, it felt lazy and greedy for what it was.\n              "
