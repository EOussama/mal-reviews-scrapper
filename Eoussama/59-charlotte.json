The world is full of bullshit, the government isn't the least interested in planting micro cameras on your pets to spy on you while doing your creepy weeby shit, but hey, this is Anime. A medium that always entrust the greatest powers to characters in their puberty, the world could never be safer am I right? While the adults are laying on their backs it's alwaysthe kids that save humanity, but hey, speaking of conspiracy theories again, the cartoon \"kids next door\" might as well be a message from those who are aware of the dark truth, I'm going off of topic here, enough spilling bullshit and let's actually talk about Charlotte.\r\nA series that not surprisingly enough relates to what I was just saying, an original work by studio P.A Works that gets a huge praise from the fans going as far as calling it a masterpiece, and hold on, that's a title very rarely to be obtained by modern works for how repetitive they can get. But does Charlotte fall into that same case? Here we're pealing off the fans' claims, dissecting this series and exposing it for what it is. Buckle up, get comfy, and let's hit the keyboard for some words.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nFirst and before anything, this is a story by Jun Maeda, the creator of the both critically acclaimed well established and praised series, Angel Beats and Clannad. Just so you know what you're in for, I for one didn't enjoy Angel Beats at all however digged Clannad so much that I consider the series to be a life changer for me, goes to show that one can only do so much, not all works of an author can be equal, and Charlotte is no exception here.\r\nIn a world very similar to our own, some people through their adolescent obtain superhuman powers, like pyrokinesis, telekinesis, teleportation and so on. Otosaka Yuu, the protagonist was living his life like a big fish in a small pot, thinking he was the chosen one and the lone in the world to have powers until he gets exposed to the truth of the world, kids all over the worlds are blessed with very useful abilities, and now he's charged with the help of the student council members that also have powers to try and capture the ones that use their abilities for mischief. A very generic story structure right there.\r\nIt does start very slice of life natured and slow, with a lot of focus on comedy until the feel train hits you like a damn \"Gamu Gamu no King Kong Gun\" when you least expect it, and let's be honest, Clannad and Angel Beats have made that very clear, I'm about to spill some spoilers for Angel Beats here so keep notice and skip the next few lines; there are even theories out there that the protagonist of Angel Beats is the protagonist in Charlotte after he was reincarnated for what they both hold in similarities.\r\nAs I was saying, the story was very uninteresting for me for the most part, the score could have been even lower here if it weren't for that humongous plot twist nearing the final episodes, my God, I don't think I've ever been so skeptical and at the same time opening my mouth as a garage door from confusion and astonishment since I last saw the plot twist at the end of Mirai Nikki, shit can get pretty intense at the end, but it still doesn't make up for the poor start, that's where most people drop the series. But it does fill you with satisfaction when you start noticing the hints that were all over the initial episodes that led up to the big bang at the end, for that, I give my props.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nBecause Charlotte is another sibling to Angel Beats, Clannad, (and to drag on the list; Little Busters, Kanon and more...) they adopted a very similar art style in design only in a more modern quality and detail. I'm not a big fan on the massive eyes that take most of the face on the author's older series, but this at least was acceptable, not dragged way too much it's noticeable.\r\nThe animation was beautiful, I can't complain about anything, but it was still nothing memorable, interesting enough to keep you visually interested in the story.\r\nI would say that their focus here was on the male cast, the female characters weren't too flashy looking aside from probably a trio that has a lot of screen time, but the males were straight up from a model factory, sorry if that sounded a bit too dark but seriously, everyone looks at least like they could have a harem series with them as the protagonist, going as far as taking the spotlights from the protagonist himself. I surprisingly did enjoy the CGI scenarios in here, I'm glad they didn't over do it, it was very short and that was the charm of it.\n\r\n- Sound (7.7/10):\r\nThe voice acting was okay, with some annoying voices here and there, so glad those ones didn't have too much screentime or my ears would have started bleeding. The only thing I enjoyed was the opening theme song, I wasn't a big fan of the ending theme song but the opening one really did it for me, I know I have extra ammo for my conversation now *wink*. The soundtrack, well, it was too unexciting for me to remember, even the music, the story was a bit heavily focused on music and yet it still didn't hit the spot, even the terrible (Just my opinion) Angel Beats' music were good, at least I can spit that truth out.\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\r\nAt the start of the series I was set to giving this aspect of the show a 3, probably a 4 if I felt generous. The characters were too shallow for me, nothing actually stood out from them aside from the flashy character designs, but I ain't letting any colors fool me.\r\nI went through the whole show and I can barely remember 2 names aside from the protagonist's who himself gave me a hard time to remember his name as well, until I made it to the 10th episode or something, yes, that's how uninteresting the cast was, probably the story could have been even better with better characters.\r\nBut hey, how did this rise up to 6/10 you ask? well, the protagonist went through a sigh to be seen of a development, I would show you clips from him at the beginning and him near the end and you wouldn't believe me if I told you they were the same person, the change was so massive and noticeable, but it didn't happen overnight which I appreciate. I don't think their names would survive for another day in my head though, the pacing has really dropped since Clannad.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI was questioning myself when I got midway through the series as nothing special had already happened, but before I realized it, a certain happening occurred, character development started flowing, and a lot of plot points were explained which made the wait worth it. I honestly went from not being interested at all, something very frustrating that this could have been worse than Angel Beats for me, but the twists at the end made me interested yet again in the neck of time, this is something that I would definitely rewatch one of those days.\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\r\nWell, before anything, please don't let my nagging about how bad I found Angel Beats or my praise on how good Clannad was for me deceive you or give you a clear image on both series if you haven't watched them already, remember those were only my experiences with them, who know, probably I just didn't watch Angel Beats in its respective mood or something, but this is an entirely different series with its own ups and downs. I can't guarantee that you will enjoy at least the first 6 episodes, I know I didn't, but if you could just hang out there at least till past the first six episodes you will have quite the payoff.\n"
