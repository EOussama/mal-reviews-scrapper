    "content": "\n                As much as I hate to say it, this was a new low for the series. We heard so many excuses about season 5 and all that concerns the pacing and budget, \"The movie is taking up a lot of resources ... etc\", so we had an optimistic take on it and wished for the best. However, for the movie to turn out the way it did, all was for naught.\n\r\nThis was the most mediocre movie experience for a running show ever. The plot was already in motion as soon as the opening scene kicked in, the villain was blanc and uninteresting, his motive wasjust, MEH, and the fights felt more like filler pushovers than anything.\n\r\nAuxiliary characters were very weak. Of course, Midoriya had to have his child/princess character to lead and rescue, and man, Rody was not IT. He just did not fit the part at all.\n\r\nSingle-handedly killed my excitement for the show.\n\r\nOverall: 5.6/10.\n"
