We're talking about an obsession with social media, Anime styled games, and of course, likes his fair share of boobies. And finally and more importantly, the dandiest man in space, space dandy, with his marvelous Elvis-influenced hairstyle and his unique taste in clothing, a respected slave of the booty and a regular at the galactic restaurant called \u201cBoobies\u201d, along they spend their days hunting down rare alien species for a living, baby.\n\r\nIt sounds simple enough, but don't let that fool you into thinking that they have one definitive goal at the end of the day, yes, they may be alien hunters (That sounds badass), but they are not tied to an end goal, all they want is to drop by \u201cBoobies\u201d and have a sweet glass of beer at the end of a hard hunting day, nothing like saving the world or delivering on a prophecy matters here, baby.\n\r\nThere were some unfortunate drawbacks on its episodic serialization, while some episodes were just phenomenal, you could almost flesh out an entire seasonal series out of that amazing 24 minutes of content into its own standalone plotline if you wanted to. Some other episodes (Only one to be more precise) were a bit bad directed, their concept was just amazing, no, probably one of the best concepts presented in this series, but it just didn't have the best direction and storyboarding to compliment it. And let me tell you, some episodes were the best I've seen in any entertainment medium, baby.\n\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nThere is something mysterious that always scream of \u201cAmerican\u201d when you put space and Elvis into a mix, not only on paper but they managed to carry on that ideology on the artwork as well, I believe that I had trained my eyes enough for it to confidently tell an Anime and a cartoon apart, and I still can't spot anything that tells me this show was not some ordinary American cartoon aside from it being labeled as an Anime. Which is not a bad thing, baby.\n\r\nDuring the fast-paced action-packed scenes, the animation looked surreal, so fluid and tasty to the eye you would beg for your eyes to be stuck on an eternal loop on that same exact scene, to think that this degree of amazing Saguka would work with an art style like this and with a perfect juxtaposition too, baby.\n\n\r\nSound (9.5/10):\r\nNow, before we get controversial, I've watched the DUB version and let me tell you, and I have taken a closer look to both versions, but the DUB here blows the SUB by a large margin, I mean, it's not even close.\r\nThe SUB version is decent, on the same level of every other SUBed show, however, the DUB was just godly, and you can only feel the animation look more solid being handled by an English voice acting, it just works so well.\r\nMost of the jokes have a strange western vibe to them so it only feels more natural to hear them in DUB rather than to read them as subtitles, baby.\n\r\nThe soundtracks were phenomenal, those buttle fluid frames? Oh, they look even better when you layer the soundtrack on top of them, it's like the same thing with Cowboy Bebop all over again, something so retro about them that make them work in this setting, and oh boy do they vary, there are the hyperactive ones for action moments, the sad ones for the gloomy moments, I mean, there are even ones that sound flirty by nature that go so well with Dandy's pickup lines, baby.\n\r\nNot to be harsh on the opening and ending sequences as they are only being spoken about this late. I can't stress this enough.\r\nThe DUBed version of the show had two opening sequences due to some strange reason, the original opening sequence was only used until halfway through the series, as the first one was never used in the subbed version, and that's where I have to stack up for my boys, both of them were amazing. They sounded so simplistic and boy do they put you in the spirit, baby.\n\n\r\nCharacter (8.5/10):\r\nObviously, this isn't a character heavy plot that relies on edge cutting character development or anything of that nature. There are some guys that honestly relate to most of the audience despite being from a distant future were memes actually still a thing (Confirmed by QT), this is a show about the gags and the jokes, and those guys are supposed to be like those guys you want to hang out with, they are likable and that was the point.\r\nDespite the trio being so incompatible with one another, they always find some way to interact like buddies to give you the impression that they mean more than family to each other where they are most of the time ready to kiss each other goodbye for good on life-threatening moments, baby.\n\r\nSomething that really set this show apart from anything I've watched, is that even the narrator felt more of the main character than most of the off-screened naruto characters from the hidden leaf. The dude sounded so chill, often broke the fourth wall and even contributed in steering down the action in the show, and it was glorious, baby.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nThere is a lot to like about this series, and too little to hate unless you just want to nitpick every mico-sized flaw there is.\r\nA lot of people would complain about the bad pacing of the series or at sometimes, the lack of action, but really, not every episode is going to be about skyscraper-sized robots exchanging epic blows, the varying mini-stories were just the best, from referencing the astronaut doggo Laika to a very wholesome family-centered episode with Meow. It just felt home being in front from the screen while watching the Aloha Oe (The name of their spaceship) crew rocking it up, baby.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nFirst of all, sorry about the excessive use of \u201cbaby\u201d to end every paragraph, that was just my tribute to the series, and will probably do the same when I review the second season.\r\nThis was one show that I never knew would make me beg for more, and to my luck, there is already a second season. A really underrated comedy centered Anime series, it really is heavy on satire and ridicule it definitely deserves the time of every comedy fanatic out there, even if they weren't into Anime, baby.\n"
