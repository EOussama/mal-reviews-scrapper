These masterpieces of hilarity clock in at a whopping one minute each, making them the perfect distraction for those moments when you just need a break from the mind-numbing story and animation of the main series.\n\r\nBut don't let the short runtime fool you, these gems pack a punch. They're like doodles come to life, complete with all the charm and sophistication of a kindergartener's notebook. The animation is so budget-friendly, it's almost as if they didn't even try.\n\r\nBut the real selling point of these mini-episodesis the humor. It's so bad, it's good. Or maybe it's just bad. I can't quite decide. But either way, it's a welcome respite from the dreariness of the main series.\n\r\nIn short, if you're a fan of 'Guilty Crown' and want to see more of the same, but worse, then this is the perfect addition to your collection. But if you're looking for something that will actually make you laugh, you might want to look elsewhere\n"
