It sorts of reminds me of WIT's art style more than it does MAPPA's. Maybe it's that spark or nostalgic familiarity that made this so endearing to me.\n\r\nVisuals aside, the jokes delivered on every episode were a batch of hilarious parody commentaryon what was otherwise a pretty brutal and harsh portion of the story, it made a well-put comedy picture of the whole thing and I couldn't help but grin the entirely of time watching this.\n"
