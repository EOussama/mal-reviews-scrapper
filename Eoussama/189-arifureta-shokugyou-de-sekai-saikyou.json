I was just lurking around the comment section praising some Anime I was watching (Probably Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari) when someone recommended to me an upcoming (at the time) series by the name Arifureta, as he/she/she called it. An immersive take on the Isekai genre that will leave me disgusted at Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari for not scaling up to the latter's amazing and original storytelling. I can't even take myself seriously while I force these words down my keyboard. I apologize. However, noteven apologizing saves this miserable, godforsaken show from being criticized, in fact, praising it is shall grant you recognition and label you like the trash you are along with you weird taste in Anime, but then again, all Anime is trash, and so are all of us. Anime was a mistake, ASO is the best show to bless us on this earth, and that goes without saying.\n\r\nStory (3/10):\r\n\tSigh, straight up, the biggest disappointment of this year's Anime for me, probably because I loved the potential it had, I wanted to like this Anime, I really did, but it crippled me so hard I began to question my very first thought of wanting to watch the show. That first brain cell who initiated all of this, why do you hate me so much? Or should I say DID because you're already long dead and what a pitiful death serving me this trash?\r\n\tYour typical Isekai might settle with an edgy/nerdy (mostly) male character into a magical world full of waifu pairing combinations, BUT, this chad of a show throws in the entire class and their teacher in our typical Isekai might settle with an edgy/nerdy (mostly) male character into a magical world full of waifu pairing. Hajime is your typical nerdy shy underdog, no very attractive nor any stronger than an ant probably that suddenly pulls up a major Kaneki on us without any warning, and then it goes downhill into a cursed realm of pervy dragon humanoid that likes sticking rods her alone. A playboy inspired rabbit girl and a lewd loli vampire that takes dangerous kisses from the main character occasionally. If this did not scare you enough you probably are a bold one for sure.\r\n\tMost of the plot is build on Hajime's confrontation with his old teammate from whom he seemed to have cut ties to them giving him an underdog's gaze, his power that surpassed all of them combined carries all the hype, and it really is very predictable that not only it is an Isekai that embraces all the clich\u00e9 tropes they usually come with, but its name is literally translated to \u201cArifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest\u201d, making this dude a perfect mix between Rimuru (Tensei Shitara Datta Ken) and Naofumi (Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari). But not even that raised the story on the tracks.\r\n\tThe pacing is very wacky, all over the place, the timeline is kind of confusing and the wide selection of key characters (The entire class and the teacher along with some head commanders that represent the world they are in) makes it very hard to fit all of them in the limited time frame of the show.\n\r\nArt (2/10):\r\n\tYikes, where do I even start shitting on this. Is it the worst visually produced Anime I watched? I'm not too sure (I do have a horrible record when it comes to that) but this could probably take the crown for it, it is utterly unacceptable for a show on 2019 to look this bad, I mean what even are your excuses, Even I used to make foldable animations when I was in elementary school that had more frames than an entire 5 minutes of every episode. The anatomy was off, the colors felt very artificial and blant and the CGI, OMG don't even get me started on that one, and I though Fairy Gone had the worst CGI of 2019 in the bag, this is just another level of trash, unbearable that I stopped caring somewhere in the first episode.\n\r\nSound (4/10):\r\n\tThe opening and ending theme songs are probably the only good things I can get behind when it comes to the vocals. The voice acting was average at best, it's probably was more due to the pointless dialogue, but the execution did not make it any better. The soundtracks were so forgettable that I never paid attention to any of them if they even were there, to begin with.\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\r\n\tI've honestly seen more interesting wooden planks in the construction site besides my house. Other than Hajime and Yue, nobody is worthy of remembering, not that those two are, and for all the wrong reasons. Hajime felt more like a China rip-off of Kaneki done wrong anyway, he was an empty shell of a character, probably on some extreme emo-edge lord pills ever since a certain incident, and Yue is the typical loli heroin that falls under the dangerous jail-bait category. Yes, kisses were fired, and passionately while at that.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\n\tDespite its many flaws, no, despite being flawed in every way, it stood for a time-killing guilty pleasure, I'm definitely not proud by picking it up and the fact that the second season was already confirmed makes me even more depressed that I will have to sit through another 12 episodes of the same trash unless it was good this time around, one can only hope.\r\n\tI really liked the music (opening and ending theme songs), I liked my fair share of clich\u00e9 and loaned for the crappy old build-ups it attempted to cramp in its serialization, it was the show I can just sit and watch whenever without having to worry about devoting a single brain cell in the process.\n\r\nOverall (3.7/10):\r\n\tJust stay away before you're done dirty the way I was. If I could rewind time I would certainly refrain from falling for the hype this show had around following it when it was first announced. However, I'm sure that even I can't say if it's the worst Isekai out there, so if you know your way around your Isekai, then sure. You've been warned.\n"
