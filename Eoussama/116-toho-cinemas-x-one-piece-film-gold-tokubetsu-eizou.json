    "content": "\n                TOHO cinema, that's a reoccurring name for Anime movies, they do a lot of collaborations with big names in order to promote their features, so you know they are a big deal. This, of course, and as the title suggests a promotion for the One Piece movie, Film Gold (fantastic movie by the way).\r\nIt was the type of concise and short commercials that tell a lot without having to steal any of your valuable time and in a great way.\r\nFor once, you don't get the reused animation from the product itself, they had this really cool animated sketch drawings of the straw hats kicking aball from one to another while they all lined up in a straight quadratic formation piercing you in the eye, saying, be the first to watch us on screen.\n"
