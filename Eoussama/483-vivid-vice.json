The song's energy and powerful vocals perfectly complement the intense visuals, creating an electrifying experience that sets the tone for the action-packed series. However, it's worth noting that the opening's appeal may vary depending on the translation of the subtitles. A less-than-stellar translation might have dulled the impact of the song for some viewers, leaving them feeling underwhelmed.\n\r\nWhile the opening may not have resonated with everyone on a musical level, the animation and visuals are certainly noteworthy. The nice animations throughoutthe sequence offer a mix of traditional and 3D CGI scenes. Personally, I found the 3D CGI elements to be a highlight, adding a unique and modern touch to the overall presentation.\n\r\nIt's clear that the opening of Jujutsu Kaisen (TV) is a mixed bag for different viewers. The song's catchy beats and stunning visuals made it a favorite for some, while others found it lacking the desired impact. Nevertheless, the animation team deserves praise for the creativity and skill put into the visuals, which managed to impress many, including myself.\n\r\nIn the end, whether you loved it or found it flat, the opening remains an integral part of the Jujutsu Kaisen experience. It's a testament to the diverse range of tastes and preferences in the anime community. So, give it a watch and see how the opening resonates with you\u2014its energy and style may just grow on you with each viewing!\n"
