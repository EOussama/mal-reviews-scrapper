The premise seemed a bit too familiar and the promotional materials didn't exactly scream \"originality.\" But boy, was I in for a surprise.\n\r\nFirst off, the animation is top-notch. The CGI is seamless and really adds to the overall aesthetic of the show. It's clear that a lot of care and attention was put into the animation, and it really pays off. But let's be real, what really makes or breaks an anime is the story, and \"Ajin\" delivers in spades. From the very first episode, I was hooked. Theplot is full of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.\n\r\nThe characters are also a highlight of the show. At first, they may seem a bit uninspired, but as the story progresses, they really start to come into their own. Each character has their own unique backstory and motivations, and watching them grow and change throughout the series was a real treat.\n\r\nBut what really sets \"Ajin\" apart from other anime in the same genre is the way it tackles the themes of identity and humanity. The show raises some thought-provoking questions about what it means to be human, and how society reacts to those who are different. It's a subject that's been explored in other anime before, but \"Ajin\" manages to bring a fresh perspective to the table.\n\r\nWith all that said, I highly recommend \"Ajin: Demi-Human\" to anyone looking for a well-animated, thought-provoking anime with a great story and well-developed characters. It's a show that exceeded my expectations and left me wanting more. And with Netflix streaming the show globally, it's easier than ever to give it a watch and see for yourself.\n\r\nOverall: 7.86/10.\n"
