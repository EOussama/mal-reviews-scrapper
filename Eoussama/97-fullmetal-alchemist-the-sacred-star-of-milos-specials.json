    "content": "\n                It has almost become a ritual for successful Anime movies based on a serialization to include some form of extra shorts to play afterward, and the majority of them are just bad in a way that could only make a decent movie worse.\n\r\n- Art (2/10):\r\nJust a bunch of Chibi figures doing stuff in a very bad animation. And the bad part isn't being Chibi, in fact, there are a lot of amazing quality works following the same approach. \u201cFullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos Specials\u201d did it in such a horrible way that made the expected cute little characters look very ugly and off-putting.Mayne fans criticized the animation of the parent movie despite it being good, but this one lowered the production value way down the pit, it was no longer funny.\n\r\n- Sound (6/10):\r\nI'm going to come up straight and say it, the audio and vocal work, in general, was a total sh*tshow. It's like a bunch of inexperienced voice actors took the roles while being as high as they can. No enjoyable background soundtracks, no slick performance and nothing to praise at all.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (1/10):\r\nThe whole time I was just waiting for the shorts to end, they were unnecessarily lengthy and with no specific goal rather than to desperately crack lame jokes that couldn't have me flinch a bit.\n\r\n- Overall (3/10):\r\nOverall, this was just one big waste of time, 4 episodes with over 4 minutes of content each, 16 minutes of pointlessness, I'd rather watch a Youtube rant than re-experience this all over again.\n"
