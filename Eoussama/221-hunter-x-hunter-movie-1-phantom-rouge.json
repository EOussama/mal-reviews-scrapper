Like any great show, even between itself, it tries to up itself for how ridiculously high expectations it sets, and the praise this series gets only re-affirms that. But that is the kind of bittersweet drug that more than often leads to disappointment, but I was too blinded, waytoo excited to dive into something that unfortunately did not live up to my fantasies.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nIt took me a second to realize how rushed and forced the setting of the movie was. Looking at the fast pacing of the parent show, you wouldn't even decide for a suitable moment to base an entire movie story and having it make sense without any skepticism from the viewers, but unfortunately, this movie was anything but that.\r\nThe movie suffered from having an overloaded cast of characters, so much so, it didn't manage to properly focus on them all, like you'd have your selling figures, Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika. Aside from Kurapipa being the trigger that started the whole story of the movie, Gon and Killua were the \u201ccameramen\u201d that guided us through this journey, having them butt in the business of a former Phantom Troup member which later has the members of the Spider involved in one way or another.\r\nThe story was as simple as having the kids explore the town around, make a friend along the way, struggle against the villain, and then come back with a win on their second confrontation, pretty basic storytelling.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nHunter x Hunter's selling point was never in its visual. To say the least, Hunter x Hunter had a very consistent and eye resting animation that never strains the eye. However, for a movie, this wasn't all that captivating, I would argue the parent show looked better some times, I probably can point up to two scenes at most in this movie, where my jaw was leaning to drop in aww. Movies have been stereotyped to feature world-class animations, especially coming from both a big series, and a recognized animation studio, but this was just not it.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nHunter x Hunter will always go down as one of the best vocal auditions I've ever heard in Anime, I love hearing the main characters, Gon and Killua to be exact while arguing all the time, they are just that good, and that's only speaking of the goofs, as when more serious characters partake in a conversation, it's audibly tingling on many neural levels.\r\nI thought the classic OST remixes from the parent shows were a great come back too.\n\r\nCharacter (7/10);\r\nHunter x Hunter for me, in terms of its characters, main or side they were, that's always a guaranteed 10/10. But it would be a bit too biased to stamp the 10/10 mark on this one just because it has the hunter name on it (very hard to not stamp it though), for now, we'll only focus on the movie original characters, specifically, the villain dude, and the friend that Gon and Killua made. And to be frank, I thought the weird hole-filled dude from the phantom troupes had me more interested in him than these two combined. They just didn't feel like characters from the same plane of existence as the rest of the cast.\r\nPoorly written characters that live off a chlich\u00e9 troupe that east from the plate of revenge, that's almost for the sake of just that.\r\nIt was nice to see the Phantom Troupes make camera appearances, Hisoka and Chrollo too, glimpses of other characters like Kite and Ging at the end as well.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nNot going to lie, as soon as I noticed myself constantly checking the time towards the end of the movie, I knew it let my hopes down.\r\nIt was cool and exciting at the start, but it grew dull nearing the end. Lesson learned for the next and last Hunter x Hunter movie.\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10):\r\nWelp, at least I learned to tame my expectations, but seriously though. I could have made it just fine without seeing the movie, it didn't add anything new to the Hunter x Hunter experience, it felt like a totally different series, no related vibes whatsoever were felt.\n"
