    "content": "\n                The Ajin Part 2 OVA was a delight, and it was definitely worth the trouble (to track and find)! With a limited edition tenth manga volume, fans of the series were in for a treat. The OVA focuses on the backstory of the infamous Satou, and how he discovered that he was an Ajin.\n\r\nFrom the first scene, you can see that Satou has always been a bit of a loose cannon. He captured the first-ever Ajin in Africa and was set on his path of destruction. The lengths that he went through just to have some fun are a little unsettling, but it's what makeshim such a captivating character.\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the episode was the scene when Satou realized that he was an Ajin. The evil laugh that he let out was a bit over the top, but it was still a great moment. The final line was also pretty badass.\n\r\nSatou is a comical by-the-book villain and a great one at that. He is a bona fide psycho and he only did that U-turn because he was bored and wanted some excitement. He isn't apologetic about his actions and he never begs for compassion from the viewer. The scene where he had a rocket launcher indoors is proof that he's a high-level antagonist.\n\r\nFans of Ajin are in for a treat with this OVA. It's an amazing look into the character of Satou and how he became the madman we all know and love. The idea that you won't know if you're an Ajin or not until you die is a little humorous, as it means that Ajin could be anywhere as long as people haven't killed themselves.\n\r\nIn conclusion, this OVA is a great addition to the Ajin franchise and is highly recommended for fans of the series. Whether you're a fan of Satou or not, you won't be disappointed by the backstory that this OVA provides.\n"
