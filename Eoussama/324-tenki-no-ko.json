A very controversial take of me indeed, as you'd see a big part of the fandom saying otherwise. This new movie has a destructive cult following, so much so that people bash on his previous works and praise this one just because the former has gotten its root deeply into the mainstream.\n\r\nAside from cameos of characters from past Shinkai films, the main cast had an impression that was there to stay, no matter how badwe bash them now, I'm sure seeing them in future works would feel just as nostalgic and hitting as the former.\r\nThe starring roles went to fairly young kids but still retained a special touch of realism for the adult audience to relate to, and if not, the movie was generous enough to highlight some of the side characters and giving them a perspective that enabled them to impact the cursor of the story as well.\n\r\nThe movie is yet again a marveling proof of Shinkai's artistic direction, but even more than that, the feature musical score felt like an experience in and of itself. Add to that the world-class acting performance that does shy from invoking heartfelt emotions by the simplest voice crack or tone shift.\n\r\nI'm not sure about the \u201cShinkai's best\u201d statement regarding this movie, but it solidified itself as one of his best achievements no doubt, a feat that he keeps enforcing time and time again.\n\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (9.9/10)\r\nSound (9/10)\r\nCharacters (8.5/10)\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\r\nOverall (8.88/10)\n"
