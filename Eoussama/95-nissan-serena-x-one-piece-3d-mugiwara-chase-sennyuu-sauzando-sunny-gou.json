    "content": "\n                This was one terrible waste of time and effort.\r\nBrooks goes ahead introducing parts of the Sunny while Luffy freaks out about his hat and agony. Of course, you have your insertive too, but nothing that screams of One Piece was really worth it here.\n\r\nIt's just another propaganda hidden type of advertisement for the upcoming (at the time) One Piece Mugiwara Chase 3D movie and Toriko's 3D movie too, with some references to car brand Nissan.\n\r\nNothing remarkable overall, average voice acting, and the soundtrack playing in the background was from the movie of the spotlights. Long story short, this was nothing worth the watch at all,it was just one train wreck that didn't know what to focus on, the Sunny introduction, the Toriko teases, the movie's production glimpse, kind of?! Well, my point is, fear it.\n"
