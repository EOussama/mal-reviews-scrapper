The backgrounds and landscapes are beautifully crafted with unmatched atmospherical vibes almost radiating out.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nAlong with the groundbreaking visuals that Ghibli Studio seems to outdo themselves in with every movie release, the sound design is one of the best. There is a specific caliber of OST mastery that can enhance a fantasy story like My Neighbor Totoro.\r\nThe voice acting was superb, even for something produced 32 years ago, it felt seamless and on par with the stuff we get today.\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\r\nMany people would start wars declaring that either Mei or Totoro is the real main character, but I'd argue that it was the sense of the word itself, the invisible part of the world that only Mei and her sister seem to interact with. Without it, there would be nothing happening in the movie.\r\nThe entire cast of characters is, each plays their role and it shows on the grand scale of things likable, the father, the granny, and even the neighboring kid.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.2/10):\r\nWhat a time travel this was.\r\nBetween the humor, the drama, and the adventure, my mind was sunk into the whole thing like I'm no longer chilling on my bed, staring at a flat-screen, totally immersed in the two children's lives, equally excited to when they see Totoro next.\r\nIt's staggering how a movie obviously made for children and still appeal to an adult audience, goes to show how no matter we get old, there is always going to be a twerpy little child inside all of us. The stakes were balanced well between not being too serious for a kids' adventure and not too carefree that nothing really matters.\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nAll in all, Totoro was an experience. I may be too old to see the movie, but Ghibli Studio always has something for everyone in their movies.\r\nFor a movie, the transition between the calm and the storm is really felt throughout, you feel like spending time with the character, for a movie that spans just about an hour and a half to feel like an entire lifetime spent with the characters and the world is staggering, but also not surprising for Studio Ghibli.\r\nA final word of truth, sitting through the entire thing was very enjoyable but also not as rewarding. It's always great to go back and see what the past has labeled as a masterpiece and what it looks like when compared to today's releases, and again, Studio Ghibli delivers, breaking the strains of time and expectations. Truly a good family-friendly watch, suitable for all ages and demographics.\n"
