And that was no overstatement.\n\r\nIt's hard to comprehend how the creators of this show thought that adding a picture drama was a good idea. It's almost as if they were intentionally trying to make the viewer's experience worse. I mean, who in their right mind would want to sit through more of this nonsense? It's like they were trying to see how much punishment their audience could take before completely giving up on the show altogether.\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the fact that theseepisodes were a minute each. If they were any longer, I would have seriously considered seeking professional help. It's like they were teasing us with just a taste of the unbearable torture that awaited us in the main show.\n\r\nHonestly, even masochism has its limits, and this show definitely pushed me to the brink of my tolerance. If I had to sit through any more of this mind-numbing drivel, I think I would have ended up causing myself some serious harm. So, thank you, creators, of this show, for sparing us a little bit of agony with these one-minute episodes.\n"
