Please note that the R+ rating is not just sitting there, so if you're younger than you're supposed to be, do not attempt to watch this, this might sound very polite for the age, or maybe too optimistic for me to think that people would go by my advice and call off their planned watch, believe me, you don't want to sacrifice your numbered days of innocenceon something so simple. For the people who don't like extreme adult content, this is a definitive pass. We're talking partial nudity, curse words, genitalia references, live sex, and more badass (this is not a smoking promotion, DO NOT SMOKE), people chewing cigarettes.\r\nFor some unfamiliar newcomers, you might be stepping into the weird territory, so if you're more familiar/comfortable with mainstream shows like the fate series, this one is by no means similar, not in the storytelling, art style, or choice of music, I'm trying as hard to phrase this review in a manner that doesn't scare people away because it's always good to appreciate both the mainstream, underrated, and weird anime junk, and sometimes gems can be found deep under the pills of stinking trash, you just have to throw the rode and hope for a big catch, and that's what I did until I hit my head into this obscure hyperactive Emerald, wait, I think it's still too early to call it that, let's decide at the end of the review.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nDead Leaves, released early 2004 shares a lot with the shows of the era, with a basic and very simplistic (semi-futuristic) story that can be made on the fly by any 10 years old kid with as much pop culture references on his/her head as he/she can fit, but not everything made by 10 year olds is a hoax, today's kids of that same age are hosting science conferences and taking it like a sweet lollipop, and the \u201cpop\u201d in there was no accident.\r\nWoke up on planet earth, Retro a guy with a yellow 80's TV for a head, and a sexy stereotypical hip of the era, both naked and with no memories, more clueless than the folks in \u201cThe Hangover\u201d series get sent to a special jail called \u201cDead Leaves\u201d residing on the last crispy piece left of the moon after they caused some major GTA-like chaos. The twist being that Dead Leaves is a private experimentation facility disguised as a prison that runs mutation tests in order to create strong mutants and sell them to the army. And now it's to our protagonists to lead on one of the craziest prison breaks out there.\r\nThe story follows a pretty linear storytelling board with extremely limited flashbacks consisted of few still images that flash faster than a lazy douche's blink. It remains very fast paced throughout the whole 50-ish minutes, all action, that keeps on going non-stop. This could be one major action game commercial with so many killstreaks than Ninja and Ali-A combined using the most sophisticated hacks there are. *insert Ali-A's distorted intro here*.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nNo exaggeration here, this was one of the most original art styles I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. If I had to put it all on one word it would be \u201cWacky\u201d. This is very different than the traditional Anime art styles you get to see more often, it's closer to being cartoony, like that childhood show \u201cEd, Edd, and Eddy\u201d, it looks very 80's in nature and contains the theme it presents wonderfully. The use of vibrant colors was only the tip of the iceberg, especially focusing on the yellow tint the most as there are more explosions here than what \u201cThe Slow Mo Guys\u201d can fit in their channel for 20 years. The shotting is just so crazy with the wacky camera angles and constant shaking and movements, I could almost swear they had the cameraman/camerawoman twerk with the camera being attached to his/her butt, but it didn't look any less cool.\r\nThe movie really left me hungry for more similar animation works, I hope there are more of this kind, it just works so well. For such an action centered movie, the colors and animation really made it look and feel more energetic and fun, it's almost as having a really sweet dream that you don't want to wake up from.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nAs if the visuals weren't stunning and superactive on their own, the music only made the action more intense and engaging it made me wanna launch a first-person shooter game and go on a killstreak, I can never get enough of that base dropping. If our dreams had soundtracks, this movie should make us a favor and smack our ear drums off, cause that shit will make you pull off dance moves while asleep.\r\nThe voice acting was also well fit in the characters, it was so well paced too that the sex scenes didn't feel a bit cringy or not in place. And remember, put on some headphones or lower the voice while watching, you never know who might hear the moaning behind those walls.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nTalking about Comedy, the characters were funny not only personality-wise, but also physically. And I thought One Piece had some of the greatest wacky character designs (still love the shit out of them though), Dead Leaves took this to a whole other level. And seeing how it took a very cartoonish style of animation, it made it a lot easier to go overboard and explore new stuff. I mean there is a zombie figure guy that has a drill for a penis, and it's functional as well. The protagonist Retro (Usopp's voice actor in One Piece) as well is a very likable person, and Pandy as well. Both are very sexual characters but with more personality than lust, that's right Retro, restrain yourself. I also took a liking to side characters, something that's rarely ever to happen seeing how most shows put more emphasis on the protagonists and leave the sidekicks out of the spotlights.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nDead Leaves is to be a movie like no other, not the best I've seen for sure but managed to go beyond my expectations. Now, I'm one to check the hour every now and then as I watched my shows, wanting the ordeal to end to move to the next task, but not with Dead Leaves, my eyeballs almost popped out, like a kid staring at that very sweet lollipop at a candy store, for me at least, this is a definitive annual rewatch for now on. This whole ride was like going to an amusement park at age 5 and getting to try out everything that you want, why wouldn't you come back more occasionally, right?\r\nIt's always good for us adults too to get to feel that kid feeling that we have and have always restrained, bringing the child in all of us can be a blast, we must never betray our childish side.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nNot everybody has the same interests and tastes and take my word in this. For action fans, this is a very close one to being a must-see, just be tolerant of the art style as it's very rare to see something like this. This is one of those movies that you would want to see with close friends while having something to drink, like a power drink or soda for how much dirty jokes gets spilled all over the place.\n"
