It would be advised that you skip this review as I'm gonna hint at some tidbits from Film Red.\n\r\nThis song compared to the rest doesn't feel all that special but man, with Film Red's context in mind, I just love how it was utilized to make a statement, and that's hard to dismiss.\n\r\nThe song, in a standalone context, can be viewed as OK, but even paired with the video it was released with, it's a hard slap, come on. The aesthetic and choice of color only deserve a medal, it looks like an animated picturebook. I also how the visuals hint at some details with Uta as a character too. You can nearly understand the struggle and the motive behind her actions in the movie better.\n"
