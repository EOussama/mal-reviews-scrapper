I'm happy it got an entry on MAL so I can justify dropping a phat score on it.\n\r\nSomething about this song fills me with sadness and regret about a childhood I never had, it makes me feel nostalgic and homesick somehow, it connects me to Uta in a way I never knew I found relatable.\n\r\nI love how the visuals show the innocence of the young, and also the despair of loneliness and the lack of ameaningful link.\n"
