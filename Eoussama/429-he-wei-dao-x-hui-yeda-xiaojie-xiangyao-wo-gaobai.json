I mean, who wouldn't want to see Kaguya and Miyuki awkwardly eating cup noodles together? It's like a match made in heaven. I do have to give He Wei Dao some credit for at least making the ad episodic, but let's be real here, the humor of the original anime was already dry enough. Adding in the humorless context of an instant noodle ad just takes things to a whole new level of awkward. It just goes to show, evenwith all the water that goes into a cup noodle bottle, Kaguya is still as try-hard as ever.\n"
