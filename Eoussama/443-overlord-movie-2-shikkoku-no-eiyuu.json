    "content": "\n                The Overlord movies, \"Fushisha no Ou\" and \"Shikkoku no Eiyuu,\" are the first two recap films in the Overlord franchise. These movies aim to condense and summarize the events of the original anime series into two, more easily digestible packages. \"Fushisha no Ou\" covers the first half of the story, while \"Shikkoku no Eiyuu\" covers the second half.\n\r\nWhile recap movies can be a great way for fans to revisit their favorite stories, they also have the potential to be unsatisfying for those who have already watched the original series. This is because the recapping format often requires a significant amount of content to be leftout or condensed. However, for those who are new to the Overlord franchise, these movies provide an excellent way to get a quick overview of the story without having to invest the time required to watch the entire series. Additionally, the release of the Overlord movies on Blu-ray and DVD provides fans with a high-quality and convenient way to watch these recap films.\n"
