Not that I'm complaining but this feels like it should have been one season along with art one.\n\r\nYou can say that part 1 was a setup, a build-up for what to come, however, the way things carried away, with a painfully slow start for the better first half of the season onwards to the third to last episode, I'd say it would have killed the enjoyment had they been one packaged season.\n\r\nThis is, as some people would say, Attack on Titan's season three-part one of the series, a lot of politicsand dialogue, putting things aside and listing a huge checkmark to what to be done in the future, it expands the world further and introduces many characters that finally close the circle of void confusion that was always there at the beginning of the show. All major players got introduced making you think where it could go from here.\n\r\nAs all action was reserved for the final 4 to 3 episodes, not much can be said about the animation, but for the parts that required it, it was fantastic. The sound design though is just, *chef's kiss*.\n\r\nIt was one of those seasons that get you to sleep the night while at the same time shows you why you fell in love with the show in the first place. It makes you beg for more and appreciates the content that you already have, it's very rewatchable and easily binge-able.\n"
