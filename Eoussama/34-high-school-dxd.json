The one thing I'm sure of is that there is a fine line between Ichi Anime, and straight up Hentai, and High School DxD could be one of the rare fewthat lie upright on that line.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nI really can't milk anything out of this, spaghetti piece of fiction, the plot revolves around conflicts between Demons, Angles, and Fallen angels but with a twist being that 90% of the cast are naked erotic girls, with the majority being underaged which is dangerous on its own.\r\nOur main character is the typical pervert protagonist, whose only care in the world is to build a Harem of his own, and I'd dare every 13 years old teen to not want the same!\r\nOur Protagonist, Issei is on the demons side, blessed with a powerful gear that all the others thrive to possess, but of course it couldn't be in the possession of anybody else rather than a typical never-give-up teen who can't think of anything innocent in a straight time without several perverted thought breaks every 10 seconds.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nUnlike the hardly engaging plot, the animation is at least decent to amazing, the focus, of course, goes to the erotic female anatomy, and half of the budget is gone into animating those jiggly breast movements that appeared to be strongly defying the law of basic physics every friction of muscle magic, next time they are going to be in accordance of one's blinking, I can see that coming at least.\r\nThe animation is mostly fine, I can go for long without being bored looking at those amazing swordfights, and let's be real here, I'm a normal guy, so the \u201cNATURAL\u201d jiggly reactions on \u201cCERTAIN\u201c body parts are provoking as well.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nProbably the only memorable aspect of this, I could go for long periods of time and still recall this amazing overwhelming soundtrack, and I can already feel the nostalgia of it, I don't know, there is just something  about the smooth violin notes that tingle me, giving me goosebumps every so often, or so that the action displayed on the screen itself.\r\nThe Opening them song was okay, nothing to praise or anything, but it's the OST where the glory is at.\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\r\nSadly, I couldn't find characters that click to me, characters whom I care about, and pray to not get harmed or killed, everybody is a comic relief punching bag especially the protagonist, there are absolutely no noticeable traits to remember rather than the yet erotic body bumps on the female cast. You could literally make a fortune out of somebody pillows here.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nDespite its many downfalls, I would be a lier if I said I hated this show, I genuinely had fun watching this, and I'm coming straight up, no, not because of the plot, not because of the characters either, while the OST was phenomenal, excuse my vulgar language, the fanservice was what kept me going, I'm not a creep, and I don't get boners from watching 2D characters, but this one had me rooting for the main character, a simpleton that lost his way to the order of the baldy twins, something about him that's relatable.\n\r\n- Overall (7.0/10):\r\nI would never recommend watching this with family, only close friends, this is no way family friendly, and honestly, sometimes it's more of another hentai than the Anime it was meant to be, or maybe, it's just not the hentai it was meant to be.\r\nUnless you're in for some fanservice, and lighthearted comedy, do not breach into this expecting a masterpiece or a story to remember.\n"
