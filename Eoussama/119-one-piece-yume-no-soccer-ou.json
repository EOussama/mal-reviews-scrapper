Your favorite characters having a competitive football match (yeah, it's call football Americans, not soccer, get your facts right).\r\nA lot of key characters appear you get Vivi, Koby, and Hellmempo, along with some memorable villains like Bon Clay and Buggy.\r\nSanji manages to prove his kick is continent crossing, typical. It feels like the type of specials that really needs a remake with newer character and updated animation, it would really make for an amazing standalone release if done right, as this one seemed a lot on the rushed side and needs more direction.\n              "
