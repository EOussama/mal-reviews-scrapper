Well, let me tell you about my flavor of ERASED.\r\nHaving not been on the seasonal fest show back when ERASED was being aired, it is hard to put a definitive finger on what was the talked-about gem and what was just another underlines bootleg attempt of marketing a two-paragraph titled visual novel, but ERASED easily falls under the popular side and having people still praise and bring up the show even 4 yearslater only re-enforce this statement for furthermore.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nA very popular trend in the 2010's Anime was the fresh improvisations that come out from fusing two different genres or aspects of said genres to produce a new church-selling show that quite more than often end up working and causing a buzz in the fandom, such as the deal with ERASED and it's detective thriller and fantasy elements.\r\nFujinuma Satoru, a Manga artist in his late twenties framed for the murder of his mother, gets tangled into a complex paradoxical detective mystery that has him jump timelines back and forth, trying to alter events and play them for the sake of saving his childhood friends and later, his mother.\r\nThe show plays out in a very interesting pace that shows two sides of the same story, from two completely different mentalities that share the same consciousness. The 29 years old Satoru is the same bratty version of himself, although, still attaining the whole 18 years of wisdom and rationality, so you could say, a supernatural kid ruining the plans of a self-praising criminal. That must have been frustrating.\r\nSomething I really liked with the show is how it changes tones and setup almost entirely mid-way of the season, right after the sixth episode, it goes from an elementary school slice of life drama fuel with some elements of phycological terror filled with mystery to a much more complex and mature clear image of what's ERASED is really about. As the first half consists mostly of events from the past, and the second half of what became Satoru in the later years, almost a puberty-level transition between the two sides of Satoru's mind.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nIn terms of the visual fidelity of the show, ERASED pulls no strings, it does what it does decently, nothing eye droppingly crispy as the type of the story it delivers requires no Sakuga but a dim and depressing palette to highlight the hardships it uncovers in the lives of the key characters.\r\nThe character designs, at least, compared to what we get from the Manga are far superior, very appealing and loveable, very expressive and believable.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nAnother thing that goes peer to peer with the assertive visuals is the adaptive voice acting, it emphasizes the visual expressions in a melody of raw Seiyuu talent.\r\nOne thing I religiously listen to even after finishing the show, and not \r\nonly that, but even before I started watching it is the fantastical catchy opening theme song, but I also was so surprised to find how good the ending theme song really is.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nERASED for me was one of those rare shows that features a rich key character cast that doesn't fall into the trap of overwhelmingly focusing on one and ending up neglecting the other characters making them undeveloped and out of the league when a certain moment the required their blossom is calling for action. In ERASED, the protagonist doesn't overwhelm the other lesser important character, quite the contrary they act as both a motivation for him and a development curve that he undergoes. Never have I felt annoyed by a certain character per se, even if there was a slight annoyance or disgust I had towards some of them, it was their role to play to make me feel that way, making them only more devoted and in-character than makes me want to bash, that even includes the big baddy, a certain person that we all suspected from the very start, which was putting off the mystery and decreasing the shock factor that we might have gotten from the end reveal, but it still didn't affect the intensity and progression that really matters. One very interesting theme that's only apparent at the very episodes of the show is the inverse Stokholm syndrome that the victim (Satoru) and the convict have between them. In normal airs, it is the victim that might soften towards the convict, but here we discover that it was the exact opposite, where the convict was the one to lean, embed his very existence to the very annoying worm that was trying to expose him all the way from the very beginning.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nWhen I had hopped into the ERASED bandwagon, I had a strong sense of confidence that I would end up loving the show and that was no over-exaggeration, the hype my friends and the people who recommended the show to me only increased when binging episodes back to back. I really loved and related to a lot of people on the show, I laughed with them, I cheered them up, and I felt their despair all throughout.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nEven before I decided to watch ERASED, I knew it was one of those inviting shows that everyone can watch and enjoy, it sits in middle of the most popular and highly praised mainstream shows and actually stands up even among the popular picks individually, perhaps it's the short length of 12 episodes that has the initial appeal to newcomers, or perhaps it's the fame that precedes its name. No matter what, it is the type of show that you'll find yourself going back to for a rewatch, feeling the characters and reliving the struggles that satisfyingly get overcome at the end.\n"
