Beastars changed something in what I expected from a show, the saying \u201cdon't judge a book by its cover\u201d was never this relatable for me. I praised the first season and to this day I keep recommending and annoying my friends about watching it, I thought it tingled the pinnacle of what it set out to be, and then the second season was released. The landscape had changed a lot since then,but a solid show always manages its footing.\n\r\nMuch like season one. Beastars 2nd season was as abrupt, as direct, and as bold in its start. It folds in the story as if the seasons were released back to back, no time wasted on pointless recaps, no primary school explaining of this, and then, we already know the characters, we already know the risks. But the destination is still as grim, mysterious, and unknown as ever. A case could be made for how the second season is an upgraded version of a yet amazing first season, but some tenacities could be brought up about the controversial ending, but that's more subjective than anything else.\n\r\nThe plotline feels more faithful and on the line of how the first season started, the murder case is more in the spotlight than ever, the characters feel more intimate and open to the audience, more so that personal strakes encompass the overarching world that outside forces seem so insignificant in the greater picture.\n\r\nThe art continues on being outstanding. It feels like an upgraded, more confident version of what was a shy attempt at exploring a medium, so risky and with no reputation in the Anime industry. 3D is always the center of heated conversations in the fandom, but Beastars feels like one of the first pillars that will eventually correct this outdated view. The versatility of 3D cinematography that CGi allows is something simply unachievable in orthodox 2d animation, it's a tool that's gone misused for so long, but in recent years, a promising future could be seen for this. Much like how some games like FarCry 1 feel like tech demos for what the future of gaming will be like, Beastars really is more than a story-based show, it's a case study on what good CGi is like. The stuff of dreams.\n\r\nOne thing that's always felt more like a highlight especially compared to conservative Anime is the sheer quality that can be felt from inspecting the audible production of the show. Season one affirmed how strong the voice acting in charge of personification the characters really are. A 3D model may look more alive than your typical 2D strokes, but it's the genuine cries that carry all the emotions are that gives character and real substance to these fictional anchors, so to say, the voice acting is the human touch that brings in life to a non-existing exaggeration of reality.\r\nThe musical score is magical, it felt like a grand scale universal production at heart. Music notes so faint sometimes, they tingle your emotion at the perfect wavelength it's insane. And don't get me started on how amazing both the opening and ending songs are, more so, the ending song, what a masterpiece.\n\r\nThe true heart of the series really lies in the characters. Often in fiction, sentient animals that talk and think are this stuff of children books, but Beastars really puts that innocent stereotype and rolls it on its head, this is no longer a savage world ruled by the rules of the forest, this is a savage world LIMITED by the rules of the forest. Beastars has got to be my favorite spin on modern society with how much it can depict the grim nature of humanity in animals, the struggle is present even in fur-covered bodies. Legos might be listed as the main character along with a few others, but we all know the real protagonists are the concepts of carnivores and herbivores all along.\n\r\nEven more so than the first season, this one managed to keep me not on my feet, but on my nails, truly a sight that makes the best of ballerinas jealous.\r\nI want to say that every episode delivered a punch so strong it hooks you in stronger, but really, each line of dialogue delivered has the same impact. You'd expect a mystery show like this would beat on the dead body of \u201cshock value\u201d to bring about a memorable legacy, but it's much stronger than that. Characters that end up on the other line of the spectrum are able to draw you in just as much as the protagonists, the line between good and evil is blurred to naught, and yet, the second-hand inner conflict you feel which watching these characters interact is an experience in and of itself.\n\r\nBeastars is that franchise that often goes unnoticed due to the feeble mentality of \u201cfurries, it must be bad\u201d. The best experiences can be found when you break out of your conform zone, not to say that Beastars tailors to the simple-minded \u201cfurry\u201d concept, it's really is a realistic outlook on society, carried out by everyday humans covered in fur, made to look like animals.\n\r\nOverall: 9.2/10\n"
