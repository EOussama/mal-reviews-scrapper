It's no surprise to anyone that Fairy Gone has had quite the hype following before it was released, with a great premise and appealing artwork, but it was for the worse, a lot of fans were left disappointed, me included that I decided to forget it ever existed, but of course they went ahead and announced a second cour that's airing this fall, more of a pain to me than anything.\n\r\nBut that talk is behind us now, however, it did strike my mind again when I decidedI was finally watching these shorts that stole funds that could have been put into making Free less of a useless character, and oh well.\r\nThe art style that helps the parent show together is absent, the music is almost non-existent, and the jokes were all lame and as confusing as the entirety of the plot.\r\nThe last episode though had a great lullaby song playing it made you long for a fairy inspired slice of life.\n"
