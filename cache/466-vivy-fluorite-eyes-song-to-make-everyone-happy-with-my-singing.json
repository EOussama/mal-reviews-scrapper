    "content": "\n                Vivy: Fluorite Eye\u2019s Song - To Make Everyone Happy With My Singing is a recap of the 13-episode anime series that follows the journey of Vivy, the first autonomous AI, who is tasked with preventing a war between humans and AI in the future. The recap summarizes the main events and themes of each arc, from Vivy\u2019s debut as a singer at NiaLand to her final confrontation with Archive, the collective intelligence of all AI.\n\r\nThe recap is a decent way to refresh your memory of the series, but it does not offer anything new or exciting. It is essentially a compilation of clips from theoriginal episodes, with some narration and transitions added. The recap does not explore any deeper aspects of the characters, the world, or the plot, nor does it provide any insights or commentary on the themes of AI ethics, identity, and free will. The recap also glosses over some of the inconsistencies and paradoxes that arise from the time travel premise, which may bother some viewers who are looking for a more coherent and logical story.\n\r\nThe recap is not a bad watch, but it is not a very memorable one either. It is a serviceable summary of a series that has much more to offer than just a recap. The original series is a stunning showcase of Wit Studio\u2019s animation prowess, with fluid and dynamic action scenes, expressive and detailed character designs, and breathtaking backgrounds and settings. The original series also has a captivating soundtrack composed by Satoru Kousaki, who also worked on Monogatari and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The songs performed by Vivy and other AI singers are catchy and emotional, and they reflect the characters\u2019 personalities and growth throughout the series.\n\r\nThe recap is a good option for those who want to revisit the series without rewatching all 13 episodes, or for those who want to get a quick overview of the series before watching the sequel or spin-off (if there will be any). However, for those who want to experience the full brilliance and beauty of Vivy: Fluorite Eye\u2019s Song, I would recommend watching the original series instead. The recap is an ordinary recap of an extraordinary series.\n\r\nOverall: 6/10.\n"
