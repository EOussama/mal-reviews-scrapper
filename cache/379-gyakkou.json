    "content": "\n                This song is a weird case, even in the movie. It plays out as a Carly Rae Jepsen son before it seamlessly translates into a heavy metallic and punk hybrid. It sounds like Uta is making a statement while she screams her throat out.\n\r\nAdo really is a talented singer and this song more than any other shows how incredibly wide the range is, you never know where her voice is trying to reach until she flips her whole resonance making you think you just clicked at a different genre song. The stuff of talent.\n\r\nThe music video was spot on, stop motion and cinematic scrolling werejust the right move here to materialize those raw emotions.\n"
