    "content": "\n                This is some sort of promotional animation of the exhibition \u201cArtPatrh 2011\u201d, no matter how I would look at it, it doesn't stand for a one-shot storytelling of any sort, just made for some blunt publication, one other note tho, in the information section of this short, it says that it's suitable for all ages, but no, it has some significant adult content spaning for several frames, we're talking NSFW materials.\n\r\n- Story (3/10):\r\nThe story, well, where is it to begin with? we could sit here all day and analyze this frame by frame and it would be a very vague panoramical experience, for instance, thecamera moves across what it looks like a crowd of people on a very stereotypical house party, you get to see a lot of background characters interacting like normal people at a teenage party would, you got you sneaky couple exchanging kisses, people bathing in beer, you really get to see their amusement, and how energetic they are.\r\nIn the meanwhile, the crowd seems to be counting down from ten, -hence the name of the animation- which of course again, referring to the ArtPath 2011 exhibit.\n\r\n- Art (6.0/10):\r\nNothing more than random silhouettes of a crowd partying, but I really enjoy those transitions, no color spread or anything, but you still get what's going on in the screen, it really helps your imagination to auto-colorize the blank parts, which then again, is the state of the whole canvas.\n\r\n- Story (3/10):\r\nThere is the stereotypical jazz background music going on, with some ambient sound effects while the camera moves around, it really felt short on the voice acting tho, you can easily notice how fewer people are screaming the countdown are compared to the ones shown partying, felt so out of sync for me at least.\n\r\n- Character (2.0/10):\r\nThere is no focus on a single entity whatsoever, but rather, the whole cast is regarded as one entity, probably it's the cameraman, who knows.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (3.0/10):\r\nI didn't really feel like anything innovative, being shorter than your typical Youtube ads even, the time feels even faster than a normal 36 seconds would, but times goes by anyways right?\n\r\n- Overall (3.6/10):\r\nI wouldn't recommend this for anyone, or else they will think I'm some kind of weirdo idolizing this type of animations, I would probably have this long forgotten in minutes to come, so it really isn't something to brag about, well, should you watch it? I don't know, if you had time to spare reading this review, you would most likely have the time to watch this short, which is 36 seconds long by the way.\n"
