It's a ruthless seinen show left and right, it shares thesame genre as Kingdom and Berserk, but we know how pitiful those two's adaptations were; just a sight of pain and suffering.\r\nOf course, the casual devoted fan would be afraid that the reputation of a sorry excuse for an adaptation would only ruin the might of a masterpiece, but it turned out, people complain either way!\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nVinland Saga is at the very core a revenge story, or at least, this first season was; It is so good at directing multiple plot threads, efficiently multi-tasking several threads at once, with a story so complicated and somewhat of a historical accuracy, it manages to flesh out a prologue 24 episodes long, full of devoted plot discussion of its own, and what a prologue that was.\r\nThe last time I probably praised a revenge story was when I finished \u201c91 Days\u201d, and what can I say, that show had some problems to address, problems very popular in revenge stories, however, Vinland Saga remains a stranger in the faces of those as it likes to handle things differently than the traditional way. It is innovative, and for a story this old, it even breaks through its dated origin and still presents the familiar in a unique manner than makes you almost smell the fresh smell of a newly bought book. It was refreshing.\n\r\nVinland Saga has too much realism than it has fantasy, something we don't get to see too often in Anime, mainly thanks to its historical settings. In an era where Vikings had a fearsome standing, Thorfinn, a young, easy-going boy swears revenge of the pirate Askeladd after he killed his father, resulting in an awkward situation of Thorfinn joining his target's ranks while the targeted party is full knowledge of the kid's attention, spending the good and the bad with them for years until you're left, the viewer wonder if the time they spent together could polish that anger into a pure intention of love and nostalgia.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nA reassuring fact about the show when it was first announced is the reveal of the studio that was behind it. The amazing guys at Wit Studio, the same folks that gave us Attack on Titan, and boy did they keep their touch with Vinland Saga.\r\nThe artwork of the show has somewhat of an Attack on Titan vibe which I would say was a brilliant plot to have it be animated by Wit Studios because they know how to handle a pale, bloody and tactical show as they demonstrated before.\r\nThe first thing that strikes the mind visually is how anatomically realistic the characters look. No gigantic alien-looking eyes that alone have seven levels of rainbow glitter to them and no pointy noses either. All you get is dead-inside eyes that faded after so many bloodsheds, stunning backgrounds and shiny blood that's itching to be spilled around. Finally, the subtle use of CGI; see? It's doable. So well blent with the scenes and characters, with matching shading, that's a praise show on its own.\n\r\nSound (9.2/10):\r\nWell, we have an opening of the year winner ladies and gentlemen.\r\nVinland Saga rocks and it has quite the vocal collection to match that.\r\nThe first opening alone makes the \u201dGuess the Anime Opening\u201d charts from the first episode; the second opening too stands out as an absolute party banger to be remembered and brought up for years and decades. And of course, the ending theme songs, this show does not disappoint, both absolute eargasm initiators.\r\nThe voice acting did not fall off the lines in front of that the rest of the audible goodies, no, it must have been an award-winning spectacle.\n\r\nCharacter (9.5/10):\r\nIt's so had to come up with a cast that catches your heart, and Vinland Saga did more than that. The show is really good at writing great, no, fantastic characters with impactful backstories and mind-blowing character development that works so well it leaves you on their side no matter what. Check Askeladd as an example. The man is a total piece of trash, he killed innocent lives, murdered thousands, raped his victims, tortured the weak, stool from the poor, so on and so forth; but you know what? Despite knowing full well how horrible he is, you can't help but appreciate how well interacted and utilized as a plot changer of a character, leaving you cheering for him most of the time. And that was just one example.\r\nOn the other note, the feminine looking, weak-hearted crybaby, prince Canute, as presented, walks the way with doom and fear, facing death and humiliation that in the end helps sculpt a clever, wise man and a fearsome leading figure that even an ogre-like Thorkell bows to.\n\r\nIn a tragic plotline such as Vinland Saga's, even your so-called secondary characters pose an important value as heavy players in a way that even the main character doesn't, making it a moving, breathing world that can exist without Thorfinn, all the while his story is used to relate to many different ones.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nI have heard about the Manga Vinland Saga a couple of times before I showed interest in watching the Anime, well, popular screening of a highly praised Manga, plus I needed to keep up with my seasonal Anime so what's the less? On the contrary, the real loss would have been passing on it.\r\nFor an unpredictable show like Vinland Saga, a show that breaks through the clich\u00e9 seasonal norm, genuinely keeping you on the edge of your seat week after week, or should I say, episode after episode, for you binge-watchers, always in anticipation. There was never a dull or boring part, and I had to watch it on a weekly schedule, it really shows the quality and care that went into making this adaptation.\n\r\nOverall (9.34/10):\r\nI would say that even having been aired in late 2019, it had already secured its place among the classics of the 2010's decade. Yes, for a Seinen show, Vinland Saga stands as a must-watch entry that I would absolutely recommend on the fly to any fan, OG or new to Anime. Take your pick.\n"
