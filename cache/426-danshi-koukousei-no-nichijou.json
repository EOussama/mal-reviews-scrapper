I don't know why I thought it would be different, given that it's just another typical anime. But I was pleasantly surprised... not.\n\r\nI stumbled upon this show thanks to some hilarious YouTube clips, but boy did it fall short of my expectations. It's a shame, I was really hoping for something that would blow my mind. But hey, what can you do?\n\r\nI'll tell you one thing, trying to relate to these characters at my advanced age is a lost cause. I mean, high school was a lifetime agofor me. But for some reason, this show managed to hit a few nostalgic notes. I suppose that's something.\n\r\nWhat I did appreciate about this show was its willingness to make fun of the common anime tropes. It was refreshing to see a show that didn't take itself too seriously and was able to break the fourth wall. It was bittersweet at times, as it reminded me of how much I miss those carefree high school days. But, as a comedy show, it fell a bit short.\n\r\nAll in all, \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" was a fun and enjoyable watch, but don't expect too much from it. Just sit back, relax, and remember the good old days. Or, you know, don't. Your call.\n\r\nOverall: 6.9/10.\n"
