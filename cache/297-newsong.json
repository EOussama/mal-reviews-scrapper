I guess one of the aspects that makes an opening stick out is what surrounds it of memories from the days of watching said episode, be itsomething important and a turn event of the story or something that goes beyond the 4th wall dealing with your day to a daily life situation.\n\r\nNewsong misses all the checkboxes, and by a land slide.\n"
