The fact that it's serializing on TV, and the fact that it's PG-13 as rated on MyAnimeList shows how little hope is left for humanity. This is a show that will teach you to live in hiding, get you into wearing camo and talk with a kirmit-ty voice, this is a show straight of a rubbish bin, withno polish and no care to it, because they knew pretty well we will dig it nonetheless, and so we did. I'm so proud of this community.\n\r\n- Story (4/10):\r\nThere was definitely potential, but it swiftly faded away to naught just like the capsize of most of the featured girls.\r\nNobunaga Oda, a very specific name for a protagonist that's directly related to \u201cthe\u201d Japanese daimy\u014d Nobunaga Oda is blessed (or cursed, depending on how you see it, for me it was definitely blursed) with the ability to mysteriously bring back people who were attached to the original Nobunaga Oda from the past and resurrect them in his timeline, way back from when the age of consent didn't matter in marriage, and it just happened to be that the protagonist is your typical weeb creep that's very obsessed with loli's and steps quite often, on those dangerous areas trying to bait you into a dark cell as well. As he keeps gathering multiple chicks and a damn trap in his little harem.\r\nMy biggest problem with the show was the context, it's easily stripped way which only goes to show how relying it is on fan service the kind of fanservice that can get you into trouble, I guess it's my fault for not having a VPN but God, do they push it until the very limit, it turns into a game of just how far can you take it and still get away with it. this season was so weird.\n\r\n- Art (3/10):\r\nI've peeled better-looking potatoes than this, and my performance in the kitchen is not even that good.\r\nNot only does it stand for a trashy mislabeled Hentai, but its production is just like one. It gives off the same feeling every other Hentai does, all blurry and kind of foggy making you feel like way back when 360p was the shit.\r\nThe character designs look very generic and outdated compared to what we've had to in the past decade, I remember the original Hellsing looking better than this, and that's a series from 2002.\n\r\n- Sound (6/10):\r\nYou can't tell me those weren't Hentai voice actors they cast, I'm way too lazy to check the staff-list for that, but I'm calling it.\r\nThe show lacked everything that  calls for talented voice actors, so their performance wasn't really much of a hassle, mainly because of the average uninteresting dialogue that made up 20% of the vocal value of the show, with the other 80% all erotic moans.\r\nI at least got out a decent opening and ending songs out of this, so I guess it's a win-lose situation for me.\n\r\n- Characters (2/10):\r\nThat's as generous as I can get with this show. Seriously, all painted from the same brush, and that might be technically true, very blunt and attention-unworthy. In similar shows, the protagonist is almost always the less interesting character, a technic widely used so that the harem gets to shine and hopeful start a fan cult around each member of it, but not with this one. Not only their design was as generic as it gets, but they lacked every personality treat that might make them memorable for a while, the only visible difference was their capsize, but maybe that's what the show was trying to sell all along.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nI guess I would have enjoyed this one a bit more if it wasn't for the frequent questionable topics it touched upon, you know, I don't want to get locked into a cell and then be known as the guy who was imprisoned for watching an Anime, big guy Jos\u00e9 wouldn't like that I'm sure.\r\nSome moment were funny, but that's about as good as it was. Probably the most enjoyment I got was when the end credits were rolling up, knowing that I have finally flipped this chapter's cover, and hopefully will never get involved with this show ever again, please don't let there be another season of this, don't do this to me.\n\r\n- Overall (4.2/10):\r\nThis is exactly the kind of trash I never want to recommend, wherein doing so lies a great trap of exposing a crime publically. Nobody wants that. Just please stay away, or proceed with caution.\n"
