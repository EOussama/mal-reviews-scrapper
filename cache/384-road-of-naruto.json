Reanimating the highlights of the series under new spotlights, and slapping on top of some of the most iconic Anime openings in the process is a nostalgic dream coming true. I must say, AMV makers are striking a goldmine of content from this for years to come.\n\r\nI must say though, some of the shots weren't as sharp or as appealing compared with whatwe got in the series, especially on early Naruto, it had that special kind of atmospheric 2000s Sakuga that can't be topped.\n\r\nAll in all, a huge thank you to Kishimoto and all the talented editors, directors, and animators that were involved in making this franchise, it's truly part of pop culture at this point.\n"
