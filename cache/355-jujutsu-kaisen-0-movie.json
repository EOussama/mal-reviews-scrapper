Yeah, it had spectacular animation and sound design, the pacing was amazing and the characters were lovable, but my experience with it in a weekly fashion took a big tollon my enjoyment of the show. Long story short, until I do a proper binge-rewatch, excuse my saltiness.\n\r\nWith that said, watching this movie as soon as possible was the best thing I could do to drag me back to the whole Jujutsu Kaisen fan bubble.\n\r\nThis movie is a prequel that focuses on an entirely different character, Yuta, a name that's been referenced in the Anime but with not much detail, but this movie leaves you wanting more of this magnificent character. Weirdly enough, and even more than Itadori, Yuta really feels like the legitimate protagonist of this universe, everything from his design to philosophy screams of main character energy.\r\nA huge plus was how the movie put some spotlight on currently established characters, and with what we know right now, it really helped the experience of seeing a slightly past version of what they were like, as well as tie in some narrative knots that were left unclean in the Anime.\n\r\nNormally, I wouldn't advocate too much for a movie, however, if not for anything, the animation alone is good of a reason to watch this movie in the highest quality possible. You'll see me bloat on how breathtaking Demon Slayer's entertainment arc animation was, but when it came to it, this movie had me suffer from jaw problems for the next two days. It was truly a fan service extravaganza for Sakuga lovers of all shapes and magnitudes.\n\r\nOverall: (9/10).\n"
