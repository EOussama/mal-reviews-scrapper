I could never catch up with it now\u201d, \u201cThat show whose protagonist's ultimate trump card is a one-on-one talk with the villain? That does not sit quite rightwith me!\u201d, \u201cThat show where the power scaling makes no sense? Well, me watching it might as well make little as much sense\u201d. You hear them, you debate them (or not), these are the common complaints you'd hear from people who are being recommended any of the major players in the Shounen game, however, it goes entirely the other way when you specify the Anime at hand.\r\nHunter x Hunter seems like that show that has figured out the formula. Action-packed, dark-toned Shounen that spans a reasonable amoung of episodes, steaming with modern-day production values from what goes for its visual and vocal fidelity, adding to that the backing up of its source material that the fans love to swear by, that is a successful packaged deal that has been sought the moment the decisive business handshake was made.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nWhen I think Shounen, I think the journey. The journey a young character has to go through in order to achieve a certain childhood dream, that is, the core definition in which by the majority of shows follow word by word, something that makes all of those shows almost look like a bootleg indie mobile game that's embarrassingly a reskin of a formula that works. The definitive template for your generic Shounen, if you will.\r\nA formula that works is an attraction for mass production, you've got a template, and you have an idea, just reskin the rest and you have a popular Shounen of a respectable fan base. Of course, the pillar of the genre are the ones who embrace the formula and introduce new takes to it, sometimes even altering the original blueprint by wich other shows in the future follow, and we've seen a lot of that from the likes of Dragon Ball and the Big Three.\r\nWith pride and compassion, Hunter X Hunter's identity as a Shounen couldn't be any less obvious, like a packaging print on the forehead, the likes you'd see behind agent 47's neck (from the Hitman series), and unfortunately, just like the latter, gets by unnoticed. With a defining linear timeline, it clunches to the goal it sets by at the beginning of the series and work its way through several interconnected arcs until it hits the sought out deadline, and then expands on the vast, mysterious world it takes place in.\n\r\nA weird and enticing flavor that the 2011 recut has going for it, that none of the highly glorified Shounen kings shares, is the snappy and swift progression, never feels so draw up when you look at it, episodes fly by so fast and still reveal on so much intel that would take your typical Shounen show several episodes to fill in the gaps. With an invisible amount of two filler episodes (Just two recap filler episodes to be more specific, episode13 and episode 26), it puts the majority of other shows to shame, not only with the canon material reign but also, just the rightly paced plot progression, you never spot a drawn-out, time buying nonsense that does not contribute to the development of the story in any way.\r\nA Shounen specific plague the Coronime (a play on Covonavirus) that's popular among the genre and a personal annoyance of mine is the unwanted fan service inserts that jump you off randomly, sometimes on some of the most important moments, ending up ruining any kind of build-up that would make you care, Hunter X Hunter just doesn't have that, its very blueprint doesn't have that in it, I would sit here and try to come up with a scenario of it, and I would never be able to. It's just that good and interesting that it never swelled by the Ecchi plugs in favor of its story, basically, it has re-defined what fan service is.  A WELL CONSIDERED DIRECTION. But minimum to none has followed on its steps.\n\r\nA weird, but interesting pattern I've grown to notice in the linearity of the plot, although quite repetitive (but still varies), is the heavy game structured arcs, or what makes the most out of an arc. Basically, seeing past the subjective structure of events, you find that most of the situations at hand are walled into a competitive game between two parties or several, all focused on the prize which is usually linked to Gon's endgame goal; finding his father.\r\nThe first arc \u201cThe hunter exam\u201d is purely strategic, endurance battle royal, a wrenching race against time and stamina disguised behind the name of \u201cselection exam\u201d and then after, following the same premise, \u201cHeaven's Arena\u201d. This dedication to the game theory goes as far as being the foundation of one of the major arcs, \u201cGreed Island\u201d; a full-on simulation card game that builds itself atop of the real world; and then there is the massively emotional obsession of board and mind games between certain characters in \u201cChimera Ant\u201d arc, a psychic look at how a game can play one's mind, doubting one's superiority and changing them for the better or worse.\n\r\nGon's quest to finding Ging is an event that's been teased up almost every single episode, being the main focus of Gon and the series, episode by episode and step by step, the goal is closer than ever by the end of each episode, making you feel the advancement of their journey as the fast pace shows really well in this perspective.\r\nRight at the finish line, when the big reveal is up, there is a certain fill of satisfaction, but also a deep disappointment that accumulated after building up your expectations to a degree that the show was never wanting to deliver on. Don't have high hopes folks, and just get by what the show throws at you, as it's filling in its rightful way.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nYou ever sit down and wonder if your favorite show could get the FMB:A treatment, this analogy has been used so much that it pretty much became a common expression to hear all the time. The 2011 recut for Hunter x Hunter was just that, and for an amazing show, to begin with, it meant everything to the fans of the original.\r\nEven in 2019/2020, the overall visual quality is still appreciated, breathing of talent and consistency, putting some seasonal shows to shame even.\r\nFor some people, saying that the studio behind this recut is none other than the fantastic folks at Madhouse, they have been regarded as one of the bearers of the holy crown in the industry for the quality shows they produce (align side Trigger, Kyoto Animation, Bones, etc...), and Hunter x Hunter was yet another nail hammered right in its place.\r\nIf I had to nominate a visual aspect to receive the attributed trophy in the stead of anything else visual, it would be the character designs, especially after you come from the 1998 original, the difference is staggering, you can make out which character's which, but the improvement that you even never asked for are there, and are much welcomed, they don't feel dated or dragging, finding every excuse for the visual perfectionist in Anime to keep watching.\r\nThe only nitpick I would probably not overlook is the \u201clazy\u201d animation and lackluster of fluid transitive choreography. It seems that Madhouse has set up a high ceiling for what you'd expect from both a third party studio and itself, that the expectations are always at the upmost of their height that you can't help but get bugged at every slippery pixel out of place. Aside from a handful of really good, directly cinematography wonders, the rest of the action feels very unmotivated on a visual note, as I said, there are some fantastic displays of animation that really speak Madhouse's name and echoes it back and forth, but some other shots++ really look like a tightly budgeted J.C Staff production that must have slipped away from a wrong internship insert.\n\r\nSound (9.2/10):\r\n\u201cIf it's working, don't fix it\u201d. As a programmer myself, that is a motto I live by, and it is also the motto this show regards its opening theme song by. The vocal capability alone is superbly enchanting you into each episode, inviting you in, calming you down, preparing you for what's in store. The visuals seem to change during every arc, showing relatable imagery to the story arc it spans over leaving the vocal as familiar as it was in the very first episode, it's a formula that works, as long as the song is a total party banger, which it is in this case.\r\nA spare of clean clothing every now and then is nice, and so is a change to a reoccurring pattern. The opening is excused for how good it is, but the ending theme songs don't quite scale up nicely, that is, until the story arc in-frame changes tones. We are treated with a collection of amazing ending theme songs, almost every arc or midway, reflecting on every shred of emotion that the episode closes on.\r\nA big part of my experience with Hunter x Hunter (2011) was the excellent selection of voice actors and actresses. Never an overly loud, ear scratching amateur. Gon's and Killiua's voice actors do deliver on such a great spectacle, those squicky high-noted voices fit perfectly with their physical portrayal, they do play emotions and intensity nicely and carry on the script at hand, making for believable and relatable plays.\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\r\nLong-running shows have a tendency to feature lovable characters or in some cases, make you think it does. Being stuck with the same cast of characters along 3 number digits episodes makes you accept them and get used to seeing them that suddenly stopping watching bring feelings of emptiness.\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) embraces all of that, only that it highlights its key characters so well that even after the very first episodes you're left astonished at how deeply attached you've grown with the majority of characters.\r\nGon Freecss is a very interesting specimen. The general trope that a basic Shounen takes for granted is to feature a goofy character that has sacrificed half of his or her brain cells in favor of some promised powerups and shares in the plot armor, but not with this wholesome, go-lucky boy. Gon is a self-described prodigy, one that thinks before acting, observes and dissects the situation with a mature tone that lifts him up even among his age-demographic peers.\r\nThe progressively linear flow of the story makes sure it does its protagonist justice, it is guaranteed for him to shine during every single arc, one way or another, from impressing the witnesses and even himself in his raw physical power, to getting thrown at the darkest, most sickeningly depressing phases that would easily overstressed the sanest person around. He is one and before all, a caring, extremely loving, loyal friend that always brings joy and happiness around wherever he goes, standing as a light of hope for many characters that primarily includes his close friends; Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio.\r\nAs a Shounen, and a definitive classic at that, you've gotta have a rival or a character of similar status that accompanies the protagonist on whatever quest he or she is on, and for the most of the series, Killua is all of that. From the very first arc, Killua is as important and as focused on as Gon is, and on some arc even more that it makes you question the protagonist label on Gon sometimes. Really, Hunter x Hunter, both the original and the recut do a fantastic job in separating the plot and characters; meaning that bearing the protagonist label isn't necessarily the focus of the show, but rather, just a vehicle for us to explore the much, more rich and extensive world.\r\nTaking a step back, the duo Gon and Killua feel like each other's cameraman, when Gon is going through hard times, it is Killua that takes on the spotlight, narrates what he has in mind, works up solutions for his friend's problems and acts as the definitive bridge between us the viewers and the crossed over universe in the screen and it is as apparent with Gon and it is with Killua, a classic story of getting your buddy's back.\r\nSomething that I've always found very unique to One Piece is the reoccurring returns of past characters that never cease to be irrelevant, no matter the time frame or the arc's setting, Hunter x Hunter opened my eyes and had me consider other shows to have the same quality in that regard. Not only a few but a lot of faces are being referenced every now and then, starting from the very familiar Kurapika and Leorio to the numerous occasional sightings of the members of the phantom troupes.\r\nI found it funny how the longest and probably the most popular arc of the series has a huge theme of individuality going on, just how every other character, important or not is, very individual and unique that it stands up no matter how overshadowed it is. Kurapika for instance, tells a story of his own, very independent than anything else going on, but still, partially relates to the overarching story, and Leorio... Leorio is one that you don't see very often. He was a meh kind of character from the moment he was introduced until he puffs away along with Kurapika, and as you think you'll probably never see him he gets back to the scene at the very last episodes and showing off why he IS a proud Hunter x Hunter character, from 0 to 100, he is one of my favorite characters in the show and has done so anonymous like a slap to my face.\r\nA specific character to me was very intriguing, very provoking to the idea of considering watching the show in the first place, that would be Hisoka. I grew up with the 1998 show, however, my memory was still very fuzzy about it, aside from the names Gon, Killua, Kurapika (or Kurabika as I thought it was at the time) and Hisoka. Even now, he is the very confusing and complex persona I always thought he was, he is like no other in the show, vibing in a creepy pedophilic way that throws one-off, but his charismatic interaction with the rest of the cast makes up for it, the dramatic flavoring was strong with that one.\r\nReally, the star of this show lives in its characters, staring so many iconic and lovable personas from what goes from protagonists to heroes, so unique and thought-provoking ideologies that put the majority of your typical Shounen villains to shame.\r\nIt is so satisfying to grow loving every decision the characters make that help shape their treats later, a true development to their values like watching a baby grow up into a healthy functioning decent human being. The Chimera Ant arc for example expanded on a very underrated aspect of any Shounen, that is breaking through the core of a character, past the Shounen norm and diving into their physiology and what makes them partake the label \u201cVillain\u201d or \u201dHero\u201d. Meruem, for example, takes his first step out of his mother's womb engulfed in a very bigotted, arrogance superiority complex, self-proclaiming to be the one and absolute king into a humble lost son of life's cause, after seeing the bigger picture of natural selection, it is not the sorted out pure genes that puts on your the highest position of the chain, but it is something else that makes an arrogant king humbler than a broke 3 digits years old farmer living in the boonies.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10):\r\nI love my Shounen, sometimes, maybe too much, but the majority of Shounen bandwagon I jump on end up very generic and confirming for the genre's trope-y run. However, once in a blue moon, I come across a series that changes my perspective on the genre and reminds me of why I'm this into Shounen series, the search for the core ingredient of what makes a Shounen really good, it's not the goofy main character, it's not the fights, nor is it the turnouts. It's the whole package.\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) reaffirms a lot on its genre, featuring fights that keep you begging for more and character development that has you revise your character rankings all the time, it pushes the hype, and never seems to slow down, that objectively, not a single arc was any lower than pure greatness.\r\nIt has been a while since I could bear to sit through more than 3 episodes of the same show back to back, yes, I would binge a whole 30 episodes back when I first started watching Anime, but then again, I was a free boy during a long summer break, but now that I've got my hands full all the time, three episodes is quite the achievement for me to realize that I'm digging a show, but pushing even further (Which Hunter x Hunter (2011) had me do throughout the run) means that I'm really into what I'm watching, that was me during the Soul Society arc (Bleach), further, a year later, I get to live the same long-sought hype craving with Hunter x Hunter 2011, but this time, not during a single arc, but the entire show. Crazy.\n\r\nOverall (9.24/10):\r\nOne Piece, Naruto, and Bleach might not resonate for all, seeing how long and kind of old they are, but Hunter x Hunter 2011 comes with a lot to offer that it leaves no excuses for not being watched, it is a pleasing magnet. Not so many shows can fast forward you from the first episode straight to the last without even realizing the time spent watching, so immersive and intense, it discards the tiniest drop of boredom, no yawns throughout, or at least, none that you can feel to keep a count of, the anxiety and risks the characters are taking are so well delivered that you yourself get dragged into the overarching drama, forcing you to sob along, and cheer when needed.\n"
