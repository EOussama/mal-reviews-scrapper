But who cares about the title when the visuals are nothing short of stunning? This music video for Eve's song \"Fight Song\" is the 12th ending to the fan-favorite series, Chainsaw Man. Now, I know what you're thinking, another Chainsaw Man banger? Get ready to be blown away because this is not just any ordinary ending, it's a brutal, demonic, and gory work of art that goes hand-in-hand with the show's grim themes. The color red dominates thescreen and really makes an impact.\n\r\nNow, I know that as a music video, it may be a little underwhelming to some, but let me tell you, the visuals alone make up for the lack of fire in the song. It's like a visual feast, and you'll be begging for an anime focused on the two main characters and their little girl companion. It's like a new take on Denji and Pochita, and let me tell you, it's a delightful one. So, if you're a fan of gore, animation, or just great music videos in general, Fight Song is the one for you. I highly recommend you give it a watch.\n"
