    "content": "\n                Now, I've never been that big fan of \u201cAngel Beats\u201d, but as the habit of watching everything, there is about a certain show once I've started it was never out of the box. Not to say I'm not a fan of \u201cMaeda Jun\u201d's work, the total difference, some of his works like Clannad is one of my all time favorites, but unfortunately, this series was everything but that.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nAs the title suggests. \u201cEpilogue\u201d, it's a secondary conclusion to the parent series that the knowledge of is not primarily required to get the \u201cfull\u201d Angel Beats experience as the show itself was more than enoughto deliver the message. It only provides an extra bonus (as the cool kids say these days) for anyone begging for more. And of the narrative it took, it really intrigued me to even go as far as rewatch the series again, maybe this time around I'd feel different about it.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nSame as I remember, only with the surprisingly consistent astounding background, I almost gave some spacing between my teeth, threatening to lower my jaw but surprised it just in time. The lighting, on the other hand, was a bit too, hmm, intense? I mean, I'm here to enjoy a story, not to get blinded for the sake of leisure.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nVery average performance, but then again, this was only a couple of minutes long and was never meant to go beyond a certain point.\r\nAt least nothing of vocal annoyance harvested, but it could have been better than this.\n\r\n- Characters (3/10):\r\nIt really was a shame. My biggest problem with the parent series was the large scale of the key character cast but the lack of their development other than just being there to fill up the crowd. A new face is briefly introduced, and only to cause confusion and give the protagonist a cheesy excuse to tease some lore about \u201cthe person he's waiting for\u201d.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nThat was really short but still had me on track with some bigger picture that might be clear at the end, but that was an illusion in on itself. I could have possibly had a blast if we got some good music records along to lighten up the mood, but no.\n\r\n- Overall (6.2/10):\r\nGiven the length of the animation, you'd think it would be an easy pick to get on. But consider the time you'd take to google the show and actually make it through the fullscreen max video settings as a setup for the experience, it really isn't worth it.\n"
