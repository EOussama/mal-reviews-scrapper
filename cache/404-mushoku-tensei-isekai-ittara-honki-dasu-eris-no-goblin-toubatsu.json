    "content": "\n                \"Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu - Eris no Goblin Toubatsu\" is an unaired episode that explores the story of Eris and Ruijerd outside of the main plot. The episode takes place during the same time as episode 16 and provides a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations.\n\r\nThe animation in this episode is truly outstanding. The attention to detail and the use of vibrant colors truly bring the characters and their actions to life. The focus on Eris in this episode is particularly noteworthy, as we get to see a different side of her character. The introduction of Cliff also adds an excitingnew dynamic to the story.\n\r\nIn my opinion, this one is a must-watch, even though Cliff will not play any part in the story for now, but he is an important element in the second season of the show and it would be better if you get introduced to him earlier to build up expectations.\n"
