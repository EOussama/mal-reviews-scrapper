While 3D animation in anime can be a polarizing element, it works surprisingly well here.

This creative decision is both controversial and brilliant, pushing the boundaries of traditional anime aesthetics.\n\r\nWhat's particularly intriguing is the narrative structure. The events of the three episodes offer different perspectives on the same storyline, a clever device that keeps the viewer engaged and provides a deeper understanding of the characters. This approach adds layers of complexity to the plot, keeping you on your toes.\n\r\n\"FLCL: Grunge\" introduces a different version of Haruko, and it's a refreshing take on a beloved character. This fresh interpretation adds a new layer of intrigue to the series, particularly for fans of the original \"FLCL.\"\n\r\nThe nostalgia factor plays a significant role here, with The Pillows returning to provide the show's soundtrack.
