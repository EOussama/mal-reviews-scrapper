National safety is being controlled by a system called \u201cThe Sibyl system\u201d, consisted of squads of inspectors with the help of latent criminals to take down people who are a danger to society, one day, a young and cheerful girl joins as a rookie inspector, setting a goal for herself to provide as much service she can, but the circumstances brought her to the most unfortunate first case anyone would beg for which completely opened her eyes on the gruesome reality she's living in. the story follows Akane Tsunemori and her squad, solving cases casually, until they hit the big fish, that helps bring the story a full circle, with a very, very rewarding ending.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nTruly, a work of big-budget production, you can't really complain about the facial expressions or the anatomy, everything is put into perspective, the characters are drawn in a very appealing way, and the animation adds that sweet touch of sugar on top of the cake.\r\nThe lightning and the dark color tone really helps blend the character with the backgrounds very atmospherically.\r\nThere was a very emphasis on the use of CG animations, it looks nice nevertheless, but there were few exceptions where it just looked awful and out of place.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nVery fast paced, and as dark as the story itself, this show has one of those scores that you would want to record and play afterward while you're meditating, practicing your hobbies, or just for the sake of enjoyment, and don't get me started on the intros and outros, the first ones has got to be the greatest I've ever heard, and the voice acting was on point for the major part, I watched the English DUB version, and I'm not complaining.\n\r\n- Character (10/10):\r\nI couldn't give it a more fitting score than this one, man, there were a lot of rich characters to go through, except for the main one, Akane while not being that great of a character, her colleagues really do shine, and I'm not speaking about the supposedly \u201cgood\u201d side, but god the antagonist was one of the greatest villains you'd find in anime, his sarcasm and ideology were on top of the charts, only followed by the protagonist, Shinya.\r\none thing they did great with Akane, is her development, you really get that sense of change, from the naive little puppy that just breached into the crime scene, to the fully mature inspector, who sees her job more seriously than ever.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nTotally worth the watch, this is one of those shows that lure you to binge them all, but don't fall into the trap, the fun resides on the partly watch, only then you can take the most out of the story, and focus more on its aspects, there is a lot going on once the story kicks in, so you are in for a treat.\n\r\n- Overall (9.2/10):\r\nI still think I'm going hard on this one, I should have been more toleratable in giving it a 10/10, but that's only something the second sequel can decide, I'd totally recommend this to the people who like dark fiction, there are a lot of aspects of gore, sexual content, and twisted turns of events, watch it on your risk, you, and only you are responsible on your Psycho-pass.\n"
