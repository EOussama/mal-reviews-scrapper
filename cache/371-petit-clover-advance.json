    "content": "\n                I have been chasing these episodes for more than two years, for a sideline picture-drama-esque OVA, call me a super Black Clover fan for even considering this pursuit, but in reality, all I am is an obsessed completionist, and I just had to cross this one off the checklist sooner or later.\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of is a lot of people mistake \"Mugyutto Black Clover\" and \"Black Clover Supersized\" for this OVA, none of the three are the same. Black Clover Advanced is a collection of 15 Chibi shorts released with the official Black Clover Blue-Ray collection, they follow the same formula as PetiteClover.\n\r\nUnless you're a Black Clover mega-fan, then watching these will amount to nothing but a waste of your time, collectively, these 15 shorts make around 1 hour and 2 minutes of content, all goofy jokes and funny skits revolving around a few plot points, I'll save you the hassle and tell you to check out episode 10 for a surprise Mereoleona cat-fit. Other than that, walk the other way.\n\r\nThese were some unnecessarily hard shorts to find, for the number of years (I'm kidding you NOT, more than two years) spent looking for these, the hassle is really not close to being worth it, however, now that the Blue-Ray volumes have been fully released, the shorts were made available easily on streaming platforms and even on Youtube.\n"
