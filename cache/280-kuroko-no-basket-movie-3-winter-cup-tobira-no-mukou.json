Something worth praising is how standalone they feel yet seem to provide an incredible sense of continuity whenever you pick them up.\r\nThis being the latest entry in the highlight movies, thankfully, you can watch it after you've finished the third season, unlike the previous ones which included contents from different seasons.\n\r\nThe highlight had two games, it covers the game between Rakuzan and Midorima's team briefly then moves all the +1 hour focus to the final between Seirin and Rakuzan. It almost feels like the perfect medicine for the show's slow pacing.A lot of people complain about the games being too long and drag on for longer than needed.\n"
