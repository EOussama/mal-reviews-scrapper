That aside.\r\n\u201cTokyo One Piece Tower: Tongari Shima no Dai Hihou\u201d is a one-time exclusive feature, much like the \u201cShingeki no Kyoto\u201d with Shingeki no Kyojin, a wide display special featuring a noncanon adventure for the sake of fun. One thing to note, the animation was gorgeous, near the budget of a big budget movie, and the plot isn't all that interesting, just some teasing about Luffy vs. Law, and some Zoro vs. Fujitora and Sanjivs. Sentomaru.\r\nI really don't think it's something that big of a deal, missing on it might leave a huge void if you're a completionist such as myself, however, it doesn't contribute to the \u201cOne Piece experience\u201d as you might think.\n"
