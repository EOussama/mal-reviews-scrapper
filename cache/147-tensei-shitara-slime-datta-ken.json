    "content": "\n                It has definitely become a religious offering for every season to have \u201cTHAT\u201d one Isekai that will have a good percentage of the fandom's following no matter how trash it is, in the food industry, that would be where McDonald's ranks up with, something very familiar that's easy to get into with a very simple to grasp concept that remains very true to the \u201cmodern\u201d reception of Anime. Unfortunately, \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d matches up with everything mentioned above, however, as unexpected as it is, the trashy part couldn't be more wrong.\r\nOn the surface, \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d seems like your type ofIsekai where your virgin pervert dude is thrown into a cursed land, along with his magical weapon and a shallow cast of females that form his harem save the world and live happily ever after. \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d has so little in common with your average Isekai and so much more with a world-renowned RPG game with a Skyrim-like depth in both worldbuilding and event handling making every episode more of a save checkpoint that bit by bit get you closer to the end game filling you with a great sense of achievement at the end of your journey.\n\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nTrust me, as generic and boring as it might strike you, it does get a whole lot better. Of course, every Isekai starts the same, the protagonist has to enter a new world after they either die or just give up on their world, sometimes it's just mandatory and doesn't give the said protagonist a chance to decide, but that's irrelevant to this.\r\nYou have this relatable middle-aged dude, somewhat of a capable gentleman of the working class that's just fed u with how he's living, suddenly surrenders his life to save an acquaintance of his, next second he's in another world that screams of RPG, but this time, it's neither an attractive shallow handsome-head that gets all of them hoes neither a powerhouse badass edgy rascal that gets his victory on demand. He just gets reincarnated... as a... S-Slime. I swear I wasn't going for the pun.\n\r\nThe plot runs through speedy pacing that really does justice to its short self-contained arcs. There is a lot of action and also a balanced amount of dialogue that serves a great deed into building the world around the characters making them feel like an ant, something very insignificant against a much greater entity, but that doesn't limit from their influence.\n\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nIf Anime could get sick, one of those devastating plagues would be the lack of inconsistency visually speaking. Some of the fights, not, let's say, all of the fights look outstanding, almost breathtaking with smooth cartography and slick camera movement.\r\nOn a general note, the show does have a noticeable almost warm visual effect layered on everything that makes everything look more greenish and natural that emphasized the medieval theme that houses the event of the story. The colors look bright and attractive while still easy to keep up with the action.\r\nThe anatomy is one other thing I feel they've done right, there is something about it that just screams of RPG, everybody looks like a heavily customizable NPC from a Bethesda game.\n\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nVoice acting wide, I can't really complain about anything while still can't find something to really praise that much, it felt decent, just above average at best, probably the ridiculous of high voices wasn't my cup of tea, but I really have to give it to the sound effects and the background soundtracks, oh, just so good, and you know how much cool abilities from magic to an ever more magical kind of magic, vocally simulating those can be a real challenge but the team behind this side of the show knew what they were doing, straight out of a quality AAA title.\r\nI can spit it the way I have it on my mind, but it's something very satisfying that highlights those short but yet powerful fire burst sound effects.\r\nThe soundtracks were really amazing as well, as you'd grown on them on your favorite RPG, the same was here, you could swear you've had countless hours of fun while watching and paying attention to them like you would do when playing a video game.\n\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nI can't stand for the show and say it had anything revolutionary regarding its character cast if anything, that was a HUGE roster to keep track of. And I'm not kidding, a tremendous amount of new faces make it to the screen every arc, and no, they stay there until the last episode, with is one plus point for not neglecting any characters. Take some notes, Naruto.\r\nIt feels really bad to not give off a slightly higher score on this pick, but I got to really take out my frustrations on some boring and badly written characters that are just there for the same of filling a character spot. Yes, talking about you, Milim, if that was how your correctly spelled and I'm not bothering to check, that's how much I care.\r\nA wide selection of characters are just there as an image of what it's supposed to be a powerhouse, but having a shallow childish figure hold a great title of power and following while being easily swayed by a gram of honey, Nah, that sounds like a wasted potential on a stupid loli from me.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nYou can imagine the satisfaction I got after every achievement done by the protagonist, as he's narrating what he's going through, you really feel like the person with the controller at hand doing everything yourself, starting off basically from scratch, literally, just a piece of moving slime with no primitive senses or anything to making it into a badass ruler that can start blad thunderbolts with a rise of a finer, just how badass is that?\n\n\r\nOverall (8.1/10):\r\nI really, really recommend this pick and even dare to recommend it to people that are not into Isekai because it truly does offer a unique experience that a lot of other similar shows fail to deliver upon. It's got likable characters, pacing fast enough to keep the action good and the excitement high all the time, and of course, it's got a lot of hype surrounding it.\n"
