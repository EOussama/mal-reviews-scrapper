It all starts when a male figure stars directing at you, knowing that the only thing that visually separates the both of you is a screen, which could also refer to as a mirror, in order words, you're looking at yourself, the author wants you to think of that person as yourself, he wants you to experience something relatable, something we all at some point or another went/will go through, the figure starts off by washing their face, indicating that they just woke up, then immediately gets ready to brush their teeth, as soon as they toothpast makes contact with their teeth, the visuals change completely, showing some abstracts of someone running towards something, the author wants you to think of it as you following a dream, running down the path of life so intensly acomanied by a heavy color swapping, which could indicate immotions, the figure would struggle time to time, collapsing and then standing back again to complete its run with nothing stopping it, filled with a lot of energy and compassion.\r\nAt some point, tall structures begin to grow, with the figure voices them back and forth, those are the struggles that would stop one's dreams and pull them into depression, we see the figure's hand open up to the horizon, that could symbolize hope, and the nearby reward for a great effort, the figure continues running until we're back to the same guy brushing his teeth like nothing happened, now, was that all his imagination? Was he day-dreaming? Was he thinking about the distant goal? Maybe it was all about the journey of the toothpaste being rubbed on his teeth, no matter it was, our character has a life to live, he has dreams, he has things to look forward too, after all, we all do.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nThe short consisted of multiple sketches, abstractly colored, there was often a change of the style in both the animation and art, the use of colors was very strong in some parts, but completely absent in others, they emphasized certain emotions perfectly, it was so amazing how a sudden change of style can really make something stand up from the others, like the human anatomy figures used in complicated dance poses.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nVery fast paced, was suitable to the animation, it blended well with the motion and backgrounds, nothing major remarkable, it was amazing to see how multiple instruments were used to achieve a certain \u201chype\u201d for few moments, like how the track started very simple, to only get complicated as the short progressed to only fade out at the end.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nThe main protagonist, who feels like a teenage adult that gives you that relatable vibe about him, you can see how calm he is, casually doing is morning routine, till we enter his mind, where we see how he wildly thinks, and he pictures aspects of life, and how compassionate he is.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nWhat really brought me here is another of Yutaro Kubo works, \u201c00:08\u201d, another fantastic piece of art, my main satisfaction was with the relaxing feel of the visuals and music, the catch behind the short wasn't half bad either.\n\r\n- Overall (8/10):\r\nYes, it is another of those \u201cnot-for-everyone\u201d movies, I would recommend this to the more mature type of viewers, the ones that are looking for something realistic and relatable.\n"
