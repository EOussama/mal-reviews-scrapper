It's like the creators are running out of ideas faster than Luffy can eat a meat skewer.\n\r\nIn this thrilling installment, we are treated to not just one, but multiple recaps narrated by none other than Nami and Robin. Because apparently, we can't just watch the actual episodes, we need these lovely ladies to tell us what happened. How thoughtful.\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong, I understand the need for a recap here and there. It's helpfulfor those who may have missed an episode or need a little refresher. But come on, we don't need a recap for every single event that has happened in the series. It's like they're trying to fill time or avoid actually producing new content. Maybe they should consider taking a week off or investing those precious production hours into something more worthwhile. Just a thought.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the bizarre choice of having Robin narrate a recap. I mean, I love Robin as much as the next One Piece fan, but it felt completely out of place. It's like having Sanji narrate a recap about food or Usopp narrate a recap about tall tales. It just doesn't quite fit, you know?\n"
