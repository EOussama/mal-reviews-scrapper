Akame ga Kill! does just that, in fact, the fans would go as long as calling it a revolutionary step in the world of anime, just because it was as edgy as fueling up a killstreak throughout the entirety of the show while at thesame time closing an eye on how shitty the show really is.\n\r\n- Story (5/10):\r\nIn short, you have a corrupt empire, the typical immature emperor that's being controlled by his right-hand man into making his people suffer in despair. A faction known as the revolutionary army is working against throwing down the current imperial system to free the people. Allied with the revolutionaries a small group of assassins called the Night Raids, that's where the main characters reside.\r\nTatsumi, a naive go luck typical virgin protagonist is finally making his way to the capital with his childhood friends in order to join the imperial army and work for the empire until he gets wrapped up into some mess and finally decides to join the Night Raids instead after seeing how gruesome the empire really is.\r\nThe pacing of the story couldn't be any faster, like seriously, 3 episodes maximum can hold so many information and events that could be arranged as its own arc, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it rushes so many stuff and causes a lot of bad turns to the story that nothing really matters at the end, speaking about the characters here, let's discuss it more in depth later. As of writing this, I'm really holding my self back to not turn it into a rant and keep it as professional as I can. The world building on its entirety was absent,  we just get thrown into this magical world with superpowers and beasts with no introductory information and that's it, there is no recognizable spacial expansion of any sort, we get only to see some parts of the capital and the hideout of the Night Raids. Characters kind of come and go with no motives whatsoever like pins of bowling, it's infuriating. The power scaling couldn't be any more broken than it already is. It consists of ancient artifacts made from rare ingredients a thousand years ago, called imperial relics, several characters possess these mighty weapons, and yet, even after setting a clear image of how strong a relic is, they go ahead and pull off some nonsense plot armor instant powerups with no hesitation, like how can a commoner relic against a legendary one, of course, the protagonist will have victory even though having an inferior relic.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nA word to sum this shortly, it was beautiful. The art style was a mix between what you'd normally see in an Isekai and a Highschool anime. Given the genre of this show, the gore is apparently a huge part of it, and for that, they did blood animation justice, not 100% of the time, but mostly all of the time.\r\nOverall, the backgrounds were kind of meh, generic, but enough to keep you wondering.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI surprised that none of the two opening and ending theme songs disappointed me, I lived all of them mostly from the first time.\r\nThe voice acting was nailed almost perfectly, a lot of deaths caused a lot of grief, a thus, a lot of cries. The voice actors have done their parts really well (unlike the story).\n\r\n- Character (1/10):\r\nEw, That is just, not my cup of coffee. There was a tremendous amount of characters on the spotlight, introducing two rival factions, the Night Rads and the Jeagers forced the director of the show to alternate back and forth between the two to give every character some backing up, and that was to some degree a good thing to do. However, that wasn't enough to cover up on how flawed all of the characters are. I don't think there was any character worth of remembering other than being a punching bag for the excessive amount of fan service, despicable, and I'm being serious, most of the females are just a distraction for us the viewers, a magnet of fan service that tries as hard as it can to give value to certain female characters but fail miserably, that is, if you're using something else to spot the logic. The other counterpart lays on the absent character development, every single one remained the exact same the started like, and that was a generalization. You have characters like Esdeath that people would argue that they were of some high qualities. False, Esdeath was always bloodthirsty, she is either going on a kill streak or being a target to fan service, where is the depth in that? The more I talk about this the more apparent how poorly written they are, all look similar, screaming \u201cI have a bad backstory thus everything I do is justified and I should get some praise\u201d. That's not how it works mate.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.5/10):\r\nIt seems my tolerance is still soft and naive to give this an average score when it came to entertainment, I won't lie, the premise of the story was interesting from the get-go, but the execution was such a turn-off. There was enough action to keep me involved at least, but the absence of common sense did keep its deep marks.\r\nThe show created a philosophical approach to the whole conflict between the revolutionaries and the empire, like how everyone was striving to realize true peace but in different ways, making them both fight an enemy with more ideals and similarities than their thought.\n\r\n- Overall (5.8/10):\r\nIt would be a wise decision to skip up on this one, I would be lying if I told you it gets better or anything of this sort. The thing is, it has always been good, but the flow of how everything goes didn't do the story justice.\r\nI can at least tell you, that you will find no memorable characters, no deep story, and no hidden message at the end of it all, at least, not if you are using common sense and basic logic while you're watching. If you're into fanservice and that sort of stuff, then you'll get just that, but too much of it can really ruin big moments.\n"
