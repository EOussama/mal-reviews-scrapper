If you're binge-watching and can't bother with striking one's self as a completionist, then there is no need for watching this 23 minutes long recap episode. I took a long hiatus from Anime in general, having been back to the whole thing couldn't have been better without starting off with this recap, it got me on my feet and well synced with this Anime, refreshed my memory by hitting on all major plot points without feeling a tad bit boring.\r\nIf I remember this correctly, the Veldora commentary on the episodeincluded some extra info and several confirmations on some plot points that were much appreciated, so even for those who don't care about the recap value of this episode, there are things to consider gaining from watching it.\n"
