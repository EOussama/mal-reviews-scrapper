There I just couldn't regard as such. It pulled one of the most boring and badly paced arks in featured that I really started to believe that the show, with its almost yearly release, is getting me kind of burnt up. Every season we see a slightly varying flavor of the same thing, over and over again, that the progression of the character felt suck in a time capsule, only convenient for monetization purposes. This show must have a convincing redemption, and fast, or else, I might just end up disliking it. That is, all and more, was the fourth season. Yes, my initial reaction was \u201cUghh, another season of the same bullcracklles?, fiiiine\u201d, and by the end of the season, it was actually \u201cplease, give us more. Season 5 hype\u201d.\n\r\nStory (8.3/10):\r\nFrom a surface level, the fourth season is a direct linear sequel to the 3rd, with no time jumps in between whatsoever, which makes it the more convenient for people who are binging seasons back to back, with an almost seamless transition.\r\nThe pacing in this season I would say was slicker if not on par with the prequels, a lot happens during each episode and the progression of events keeps escalating until the climax you know you're going to love happens.\r\nSo many great moments in this one, and only after you think the season has given all you were expecting, came the last arc spanning the last two episodes with a comeback bigger than anything we've seen before, I would arguably was at the same level of aww as the One For All vs. All For One fight.\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nIt seems like Boku no Hero Academia has set up a score for itself and keeps breaking it and pushing forward with every season. That is what a battle seasonal Shounen should be. Sakuga that ascends from heaven, Sakuga that makes you go on rampant rewatches on Youtube, Sakuga that makes you memories and take interest in the animators behind.\r\nAt the core of it, the fights might just be hero vs. villain, but the cake topping it got truly puts it above many other fights.\r\nYet again, excelling at what t does best, impact frames, you just can feel the punches, you almost react on a physical way when you see how crazy something happens, and how fabulous the color palettes changes unprecedently.\n\r\nSound (8.6/10):\r\nMaybe it was just me, but My Hero Acamedia always had such a bombastic OST that works whatever the circumstance. You're at a gym and need something to get you pumped up? There is an OST for that. You want something slice-of-life-y to chill and relax too? There is plenty of that, or what!? something heavy n emotion now? We've got just the right track for you. It is a wide and varying collection of greatly put together vocals that just keep you wanting.\n\r\nThe voice acting too is worth praising. Every season has it's the high moment, and all of them come nicely together when you put the narrative, the visuals, and the audio together. It might sound like a great silent movie without it, but man does the vocal credibility of the show shine and make a noticeable presence.\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are another side of what makes a show memorable, what makes it brought up into conversation too often and what makes up the majority of its Youtube surfing. Although not the best the series has had, but definitely right there among the best of the season.\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\r\nThis season might have as well been the best My Hero Academia has ever been presenting its characters. Where do I even start? Big highlights for Lemillion, and even greater highlights for Endeavor. And don't even, get me started on Hawk. Dude's first appearance in the show and he manages to become one of the best heroes.\r\nWhat really sells this season for me the most is how \u201creliant\u201d it was on not-so protagonists, it gave a lot of exposure to lesser featured characters and that somehow turned out to be a better screening that some of the biggest key characters make up for. I mean, just look at Gentle and La Brava. Two characters appeared out of nowhere end up connecting with so many viewers, spaning a relatable perspective.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI'm still debating with myself even as I write this review, but this season might be my favorite in the franchises. It was what awakened my love for the series, which made me appreciate its overlooked aspects more and what made up most of the fun I had watching a feature show this season.\n\r\nOverall (8.68/10):\r\nThe fourth season felt to me like an eye-opener for the burnt-out fan of the series. It revisits the same aspects and ideas of its prequels, but pusher its limit to another length, expressing more on emotions, this time on the lesser featured characters, it's not always Deku and the boys, but even some of the minimal faces, new and old get massive exposure and characteristic.\n"
