    "content": "\n                A long time has passed and only faint memories of the parent show remain.\r\nSukitte Ii na yo.: Mei and Marshmallow feels like a pointless collection of shorts that averages around a minute an episode (for 10 episodes). Only to start gags and make fun of some plot points, and to be honest, the fans would consume everything their favorite series can offer.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nA perfect mixture of both cute Chibi and a strange minimalistic 3D art style, one that makes me beg for a lengthy series with the same visual quality.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nGreat voice acting, very cute from Mei's part. I really liked the catparody of the few first seconds of the series' opening theme song.\n\r\n-  Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nNot enough to make me giggle, but just about enough to appreciate the minimalistic waste of time I had on this. I really was left with a great desire to rewatch the parent show, it feels like a true nostalgia dosage.\n\r\n- Overall(7.33/10):\r\nGreat shorts gave their length, it shouldn't really take up any more than 8 minutes or so, and the quality is just as decent. The fans would differently appreciate.\n"
