            "content": "\n                It seems that lately, most if not all (especially) crappy series trying to push a recap episode in the midst of being aired, probably as a call of desperate cash grab because they can't pull up a complete 12 episodes to seal the traditional seasonal mark. Or maybe it's one of those \u201cHere is where the series picks up, so you might as well recap what happened so far\u201d. But when you're presented with a trashy, lazy and extremely low-quality series, the last thing you'd want is more of the same garbage. That's one of my complaints as a completionist, I can't leave out thesmallest of related content to a series no matter how bad I hate it, it's both a curse (in this case) and a blessing on rare occasions.\n\r\n\u201cArifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou\u201d has managed to hype up a massive selection of the Isekai fans prior to its release, however, the disappointment was far greater than anyone had anticipated, and with this recap episode, you only get to see how much rushed and incomplete the storytelling was. So slow you could space out most of the episode, and suddenly, it jumps into being a fast-paced shitfest that requires more energy to follow up with than necessary.\n\r\nThe recap doesn't come up with anything new but a couple of teases for a new character at the end, however, you do get to see how much potential this story had, as they stripped off everything that was filling up the air time of each episode, leaving you only with the highlights. This series could have been at least decent, it turned out it carried more trouble than it was worth.\n"

The movie features the game against Murasakibara and Kise from season 2 and 3 respectively, this format is really working out good for this franchise.\n\r\nI mean, expect nothing special, if anything, these highlights are the perfect route to take if you're up for a lightweight rewatch, even for people who know nothing about the series.\n"

I just have so much to say about this show as a whole, I figured out I might as well make a full-fledged review and call it a day.\n\r\nImaging going through every big moment in the Attack on Titan franchise, bit by bit, and turning the saddest and serious plot points into the most hilarious in context jokes, put it simply, this is just a huge meme of a show.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nAs the story starts, this is an alternative timeline, whereall the events of the story take a more comedy-oriented approach, no over gory deaths, and none of that, just pure Attack on Titan memes.\r\nAll your typical familiar faces from the original shaw and OVAs make a comeback, It's about school struggles, and activities along the way, very basic story progression that focuses more on telling jokes than development.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nVery basic chibi art, but in a super cute way, (but not as cute as Attack on Titan drama pictures), the animation is very subtle;, really nothing remarkable to mention here, other than the phenomenal camera movements on some parts, and the great use of CG and particle effects.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nI can't get enough of the original opening's ripoff, and the same can be said about the ending song too. the soundtrack is just as strong, and the voice acting is on point, man, I just love Sasha's voice act, among all of the characters, she has the perfect one for a chibi makeover.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nMy, very hilarious  recreations, what I really adore about this cast, is the comeback of characters from the OVAs, like for instance, Ilse, Isabel, and Farlan, not only the human characters are amazing, but also the Titans as a counterparts, yes, there is a supposed -best-titan in this show, and they bring a lot of joy to see in a more goofy way.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nThe humor is what makes this show stand out, it's just pure (sometimes hysterical) laughter one after the other. the humor is very easy to catch on with, as far as I know, every typical Attack on Titan fan would get a grasp on it, it really enjoyment comes from real event recreations, the ripoffs and references are killing it.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nAs much as I love this show, and willing to recommend it to basically everyone, there is a very specific audience that this show is aimed at, as a big Attack on Titan fan, having watched the two original seasons and OVAs for no less than 3 times, I found some jokes to be very hard to catch upon unless you know the references very well, only then, the humour flash would trigger you up.\n"

I guess one of the aspects that makes an opening stick out is what surrounds it of memories from the days of watching said episode, be itsomething important and a turn event of the story or something that goes beyond the 4th wall dealing with your day to a daily life situation.\n\r\nNewsong misses all the checkboxes, and by a land slide.\n"

            "content": "\n                What made the original FLCL so good, that is the question. It's been 17 years since that one series impacted its fans, and after what looked like an eternity, out of nowhere struck the news of getting two new adaptations. The first episode of FLCL Alternative was aired on April the 1st making a pleasant intro to remember. However, all the hype started dying after the disappointment FLCL Progressive was badly received by the fans of the original, and thus making the next upcoming entry (FLCL Alternative) in the same expectancy as well. Surprise surprise, it did better, no, I did amazingly better that Imight go as far as putting it above the original on some respect, and a lot of people disagree with me on the simple fact that it didn't start fully faithful to the core message of FLCL. And dare I say, FLCL Alternative did, in fact, embrace the same idea of FLCL but in a different way and perspective, it added some extra seasoning and made the FLCL of its own.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nA big commotion starter is how a new thing breaks the traditional way of doing a particular thing. Such is the way the two new adaptations of FLCL are in. FLCL Alternative on the other hand broke that convention and had it the other way despite what one can say, and it actually was great.\r\nMore than ever, the hidden message is no more, instead, it's presented very clear and bright, only a lacking person would miss on it. FLCL was always about growing up, and FLCL Alternative was no stranger to the idea, only had a different take on its execution.\r\nThe definition of growing up here was that things must change at some point, a student will no longer remain a student, and will have to move on to handling more complicated responsibilities than just studying. Takkun had it in FLCL, being extremely young and almost out of middle school, so naive and strange to anything grown up. FLCL Alternative stepped it up a bit, and had highschoolers going against themselves between going edgy and following an acceptable path in life, probably the hardest turn point on one's life.\r\nFriendship was a great player in spicing up controversy, having grown with a select group of people and then parting with them due to personal dreams can either shake things up or ease them. Growing up only becomes more and more clear the more you move on, and it turned up it was never a choice. Seeing adults doing adult stuff can have a lot of depth behind it, much like eating spicy food and have little to no annoyance while doing it doesn't make you a mature person, you can still eat it while enduring its spiciness or bitterness for the sole purpose of survival. It's doesn't always go your way, that was what FLCL Alternative was going for.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nImagine the abstractness of FLCL mixed with the more modern and refined technics of mainstream animation that does a better than imagined job at keeping it as FLCL as possible without throwing any turn-offs, unless you're just complaining because you were against the idea of a new take on the franchise.\r\nI'd say, the original still holds up pretty well to even score next to movie-class animations, and while FLCL Alternative doesn't go that far it still puts the rest seasonal fellows faced to a shameful corner. Aside from a minor sighting of above average CGI use, it was visually almost a full-fledged FLCL experience.\r\nOne thing I think FLCL Alternative did better though is the character design, although Haruto is still noticeably Haruko, you can't help but feel a sense of modern touch on especially her face, something about it that makes her more like a human than the alien she is.\r\nI really loved the explosion and particle effects overall, so detailed and fluid it made all the intense parts Michael-Bay-worthy.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nThe pillows did it again, never this happy to hear a familiar drop before, so nostalgic and fitting it just never gets old.\r\nAgain, no opening theme song introduced, which is perfectly fine, with FLCL the soundtracks make up for almost any mistake (No chance Progressive, no chance today). The ending theme song was just great, it suited the theme this season was going after, growing up, a very relatable topic that your ear would swear on its quality.\r\nI first experienced FLCL in its subbed form and was not exposed to the dubbed version until I gave FLCL Progressive a chance which was horrible at first (Haruko's voice was a pass for me), but it kind of gave me the initial push that had me at home with the dubbed version of FLCL Alternative, Haruko's tone had already become easier to listen to and the new cast was really amazing.\n\r\n- Character (9.5/10):\r\nMost differently, FLCL Alternative nailed its characters even more than the two previous installments did. With the series giving focus on more than just one, it never neglected the others and had them affect the story just as much. For a change, the friendly quadruples had troubles and personal issues to tend to after facing the other way from each other, it really made it feel like a shared story. A lot of slice of life aura was felt due to this, and as different as FLCL Alternative was, it really did it justice in a way.\r\nI for one found myself invested in all of those characters, I tore for them, laughed for them, and was with them till the end, all likable and offer a variety of impact on the story.\r\nThe most controversial part here was Haruko, a lot of people were turned down by the new big sister that gives advice and cares for other people, it was no longer the selfish backstabber we all grew up knowing, which in my book was a nice take from FLCL Alternative, sometimes changing the trend helps to refresh the genre.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nRight after watching the first episode I knew what I was signing up for.\r\nIn my opinion, out of the three installments, this one was the greatest, between the original whacky and loved FLCL, and the modern and badly received FLCL Progressive, FLCL Alternative took the perfect foot in between and provided the best out of both takes, it's a lot more easier to grasp than both as well, the core message it kind of painfully obvious since the first half, but it wasn't any less fun.\r\nI enjoyed the different side stories it provided a lot more so that I would pay for an extended slice of life of these individual characters, it kept consistent throughout its 6 episodes.\n\r\n- Overall (8.8/10):\r\nOne thing that you should really step in with, is an open mind, and the rest will be a short begged for enjoyment.\r\nBashing on how it's different is only a turn down that easily blindfolds the fans from experiencing a take they never asked for but would greatly appreciate otherwise.\r\nAnother side note would be, watching this before you see the first two installments won't make much of a fuss as prior knowledge of previous happenings won't take away much. In fact, it would be a great and different experience watching them all in reverse.\n"

But don't worry, it's not like Luffy suddenly becomes a tax accountant or anything. It's just some tweaks here and there, like Hody's defeat or Caesar's capture.\n\r\nBut let's not forget the real highlight of this 4D experience: the teases from mid-Dressrosa. Who needs the full Dressrosa arc when you can get a sneakpeek in 4D? It's like a movie trailer, but without the \"coming soon to theaters\" part.\n\r\nIn all seriousness, though, One Piece 4D is a fun addition to the Tokyo One Piece Tower theme park. It's like a mini adventure with your favorite characters in stunning 3D. Just be warned, if you're prone to motion sickness, the 4D part might be a bit too much. But hey, at least you can say you've experienced One Piece in four dimensions.\n"

You'd think at first it would be like no other casual chapter read but it actually was better than having the whole thing animated and risk the probably bad animation.\r\nI really loved the slightly different feel of the art style, it appears to be killing the modern high school drama art style and worked surprisingly like a charm.\r\nProbably the greatestthing about this, and having the setting be a normal high school, the clothing was just a massive overhaul, it made all of them look like fresh characters from some other series, especially Naruto.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nThe voice acting was a whole other experience from what you get in any other Naruto animation production. As the panels go by, the immersion from the characters narrating their lines take you by surprise on how cozy their speech pattern appears to be, a lot of dynamic and un-scripted (although it was) on the surface, as if you're listening to some rural storyteller talking about one of his old adventures.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI loved the crazy references and the circle jerking they had going on about the main series. A lot of brilliant fourth wall breaking regarding manga references even. I'd say, the greatest comedic attempt Naruto has ever done brilliantly to let me genuinely let down some gags and appreciate what they were going on.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nI really, and strongly recommend seeing this as it offers a lot than a simple picture drama does by the words. Fan of the series or not, it sure has got at least a couple of laughs in store, and it's only 8 minutes long.\n"

            "content": "\n                More often than not, violence, lewd and comparable stuff is the selling point of most of Anime out there, I mean, why would you watch a cute show when you can watch body ripping Gundams all day, with intense battles and tone shifting dramas, am I right? No, hell not.\r\nMiira no Kaikata comes to address just that, we don't usually see similar relaxing slice of lives were we follow a cast of character while they go about their days, living in harmony and peace, no wars to worry about, no hardships of any sorts or nothing, and you know, we all deserve peace of mind.\n\r\nStory(8/10):\r\nIt's a stable among slice of life shows, they follow the life or a period of someone's daily hustles, sometimes, following a personal goal, trying to relate the characters to the viewer, Miira no Kaikata does not go against any of that, however, no goal is \u201ctruly\u201d set, we get to focus on the relationships of four high schoolers and their secret Yokai pets that emit more cuteness than the name \u201cYokai\u201d can ever bear.\n\r\nJust like any other day, Sora receives a package from his father who made it a horrifying habit to send his son all sorts of horrible curses and haunted playthings as genuine presents, and as that habit taught Sora, never open any packages unless he's fully armed, full-on alert, and really for assault, until an adorable, helpless, tiny Mummy walks out with more cuteness than one can handle. That's when the story kicks in.\n\r\nAlong the line, Sora and the Mummy whom he names \u201cMii-kun\u201d learn to understand each other, as every episode, each side learns about the other more.\n\r\nAside from a couple of episodes, all mini-arcs were self-contained, spaning an episode each, very easy to follow and cruise through, the pacing never felt too slow or too fast, always keeping things steady and relaxing.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nArt is very subjective and prone to taste, that's why context matters a lot.\r\nOn normal circumstances, this show would have been around 7/10 in terms of visual fidelity, however, seeing how the show is trying to be cute, who am I to deny that, it nails special kind of art style that skyrockets the cuteness it tries to deliver. All creatures are super cute and heartwarming just to look at, the colors are very relaxing and well balanced, never too strain on the eyes, and the backgrounds fit tightly, bringing everything together just nicely.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nOk, As soon as Mii-kun barked, I had to give this at least 9/10, seriously, go hear a compilation of that, I guarantee you a cure for every illness there is.\r\nThe voice acting is top-notch, I'm not talking about any world-class performances, but the sheer simplicity of it was more than enough to deliver of the relaxing, happy atmosphere that fills the show. All of the characters speak in a reassuring manner, the blend the humor and life lessons they teach perfectly, leaving nothing else to nag on.\n\r\nThe opening theme song is definitely a grower, not the best one out there, but man does it connect later on. The ending theme song was just on the spot. I like the energy and mood it delivers, perfectly suitable to hear after every heartwarming episode.\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\r\nI am such an annoying picky perfectionist whenever it comes to the characters, I couldn't count on a single hand the show I considered as a solid 10/10 on the character department, but man, did this show blew me out of my rational.\r\nTo start off, I never hated, disliked, or rolled my eyes on any of the characters, they were all relatable on some level and very likable. Sora is a fantastic main character for his series, he embodies the idealistic philosophy that he represents, the ultimate Mary Sue.\r\nThe supporting cast was just as good, their backstories stuck to the mind easily, they are very relevant and with a lot of screentime. And of course, the adorable Yokai, Mii-kun, Conny, Isao, and Mukumuku. Oh right, the Galaxy Tights pig-thing that appeared on that one episode, not even Elvis can match his style.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nI never expected anything from the show, and probably that was for the better, it was just another show I had to move from my plan-to-watch list and ended up easily one of the best things I've ever watched, but it's worth noting that time was very crucial and a heavy player for me.\r\nWork had me on some immense pressure that I just had to invest and something and relax to easy off the deadlines, luckily, Miira no Kaikata was just the right mental medicine. I ended up binging the show under 3 days, and that's saying a lot looking at my suffocating schedule, what a great show.\n\r\nOverall (9.1/10):\r\nIt's always good to take things slow and steady sometimes, turned up Anime can also do that aside from the mainstream lewd and violence trope that the media tags it as.\r\nMiira no Kaikata is the show that values friendship, family and strong bonds, and for such times as today, a lot of relationships grow weaker and further day after day, and here is this show alluding to that indirectly, showing just how great it is to surround yourself with people that care about you and support you.\r\nDefinitely one of those shows that find YOU and not the other way around, highly recommend watching this, but please, proceed with low expectations. Let the show take its time, if you're here for romance, there is none, if it's drama you're after, there is a different kind of drama that gets tackled, but if you're here to relax primarily, then you might just have won a pre-paid ticket to Hawaii.\n"

It's a ruthless seinen show left and right, it shares thesame genre as Kingdom and Berserk, but we know how pitiful those two's adaptations were; just a sight of pain and suffering.\r\nOf course, the casual devoted fan would be afraid that the reputation of a sorry excuse for an adaptation would only ruin the might of a masterpiece, but it turned out, people complain either way!\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nVinland Saga is at the very core a revenge story, or at least, this first season was; It is so good at directing multiple plot threads, efficiently multi-tasking several threads at once, with a story so complicated and somewhat of a historical accuracy, it manages to flesh out a prologue 24 episodes long, full of devoted plot discussion of its own, and what a prologue that was.\r\nThe last time I probably praised a revenge story was when I finished \u201c91 Days\u201d, and what can I say, that show had some problems to address, problems very popular in revenge stories, however, Vinland Saga remains a stranger in the faces of those as it likes to handle things differently than the traditional way. It is innovative, and for a story this old, it even breaks through its dated origin and still presents the familiar in a unique manner than makes you almost smell the fresh smell of a newly bought book. It was refreshing.\n\r\nVinland Saga has too much realism than it has fantasy, something we don't get to see too often in Anime, mainly thanks to its historical settings. In an era where Vikings had a fearsome standing, Thorfinn, a young, easy-going boy swears revenge of the pirate Askeladd after he killed his father, resulting in an awkward situation of Thorfinn joining his target's ranks while the targeted party is full knowledge of the kid's attention, spending the good and the bad with them for years until you're left, the viewer wonder if the time they spent together could polish that anger into a pure intention of love and nostalgia.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nA reassuring fact about the show when it was first announced is the reveal of the studio that was behind it. The amazing guys at Wit Studio, the same folks that gave us Attack on Titan, and boy did they keep their touch with Vinland Saga.\r\nThe artwork of the show has somewhat of an Attack on Titan vibe which I would say was a brilliant plot to have it be animated by Wit Studios because they know how to handle a pale, bloody and tactical show as they demonstrated before.\r\nThe first thing that strikes the mind visually is how anatomically realistic the characters look. No gigantic alien-looking eyes that alone have seven levels of rainbow glitter to them and no pointy noses either. All you get is dead-inside eyes that faded after so many bloodsheds, stunning backgrounds and shiny blood that's itching to be spilled around. Finally, the subtle use of CGI; see? It's doable. So well blent with the scenes and characters, with matching shading, that's a praise show on its own.\n\r\nSound (9.2/10):\r\nWell, we have an opening of the year winner ladies and gentlemen.\r\nVinland Saga rocks and it has quite the vocal collection to match that.\r\nThe first opening alone makes the \u201dGuess the Anime Opening\u201d charts from the first episode; the second opening too stands out as an absolute party banger to be remembered and brought up for years and decades. And of course, the ending theme songs, this show does not disappoint, both absolute eargasm initiators.\r\nThe voice acting did not fall off the lines in front of that the rest of the audible goodies, no, it must have been an award-winning spectacle.\n\r\nCharacter (9.5/10):\r\nIt's so had to come up with a cast that catches your heart, and Vinland Saga did more than that. The show is really good at writing great, no, fantastic characters with impactful backstories and mind-blowing character development that works so well it leaves you on their side no matter what. Check Askeladd as an example. The man is a total piece of trash, he killed innocent lives, murdered thousands, raped his victims, tortured the weak, stool from the poor, so on and so forth; but you know what? Despite knowing full well how horrible he is, you can't help but appreciate how well interacted and utilized as a plot changer of a character, leaving you cheering for him most of the time. And that was just one example.\r\nOn the other note, the feminine looking, weak-hearted crybaby, prince Canute, as presented, walks the way with doom and fear, facing death and humiliation that in the end helps sculpt a clever, wise man and a fearsome leading figure that even an ogre-like Thorkell bows to.\n\r\nIn a tragic plotline such as Vinland Saga's, even your so-called secondary characters pose an important value as heavy players in a way that even the main character doesn't, making it a moving, breathing world that can exist without Thorfinn, all the while his story is used to relate to many different ones.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nI have heard about the Manga Vinland Saga a couple of times before I showed interest in watching the Anime, well, popular screening of a highly praised Manga, plus I needed to keep up with my seasonal Anime so what's the less? On the contrary, the real loss would have been passing on it.\r\nFor an unpredictable show like Vinland Saga, a show that breaks through the clich\u00e9 seasonal norm, genuinely keeping you on the edge of your seat week after week, or should I say, episode after episode, for you binge-watchers, always in anticipation. There was never a dull or boring part, and I had to watch it on a weekly schedule, it really shows the quality and care that went into making this adaptation.\n\r\nOverall (9.34/10):\r\nI would say that even having been aired in late 2019, it had already secured its place among the classics of the 2010's decade. Yes, for a Seinen show, Vinland Saga stands as a must-watch entry that I would absolutely recommend on the fly to any fan, OG or new to Anime. Take your pick.\n"

I don\u2019t know.\r\nThis episode/movie was better than the last one in terms of hype and action, however, I felt like the visuals have gotten a significant downgrade.

The primary goal from these special episodes was always that, quick standalone recaps that one can watch and save the countless hours that they would put have they went with the Anie binging route, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. However, as bad as it seems, not every recap manages to leave a nice memory about it, does this also concern this special?\n\r\nFollowing the same trend of \u201cEpisode of X\u201d releases,this special focuses on Sabo and his perspective on the event that overlapped Dressrosa, for what've seen from the canon plot, Sabo was only introduced almost midway into the arc, it turned out that he was already there before any of the chaos unraveled.\n\r\nWe all hate useless flashbacks, flashbacks that are told so much that it throws you in some hurtful Naruto nightmares and its endless recursive line of the same flashback repeating over and over again. We've already seen the history of the three brothers on so many occasions before that we could tell it from start to finish as if it was a contest. I mean, yes, it's crucial to the special seeing how it focuses on a character that we've only got introduced to through a flashback arc, to begin with, but still, Dressrosa was a dragged out nightmare already, so there was no need to massacre this recap in the same brutal way.\n\r\nOn a whole, it was really enjoyable and fun to dig through some highlights from the Dressrosa arc whilst getting new content that the canon lacked, even though most of it was Sabo monologing about how Luffy has grown from a crybaby to a strong, capable man.\r\nI still like how the Anime did a lot of things better than this special, they even included altered dialogue and even completely different scenarios for some reason. The only thing I thought the special did better than the Anime was Sabo's flashed out fight against Diamante and Luffy's fight against Don Chinjao, although, I like the how latter was set up in the Anime more.\r\nOn these two specific fights, the animation really stood out and asserted its dominance as a higher produced piece of animation.\n"

This is a story in a timeline somewhere before the big jump ofinventions, around feudal Japan era, you have your mere humans, looking at natural resources the look of a gold mine, and on the other hand, nature itself has its guardians, beastly huge talking animals, that are referred to as Gods, all they do is practicing what you'd expect from mother nature reflexes, they are angry, and very furious against humans, that they are on the verge of a great war between the two classes.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nThe story starts typically, with our protagonist, a prince called Ashitaka who is faced with a threat of death, caused by a curse that was cast on him upon making contact with a daemon, as for, he was set to travel, and look for a cure, along his way, he meets lots of people, made friends and foes, and has set himself a goal to stop the war between humans and the animals. As you might expect, every prince needs a princess, here came princess Mononoke, thus the movie's title, the two humans yet very different individuals both culturally and morally learn more about each other's environments, they grow fond of themselves, and more importantly face off the wrath of Gods and Demons.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nThe animation, seeing how this was made back in 1997, a year older than me, looks amazing you can almost taste it. the production team made a splendid job with the lighting effects, and reflections as well. there were a lot of complex fluid animations displayed too, which today's studios would have used CG to accomplish them, and they would still look terrible, the backgrounds and environment look very astonishing, the way how leaves dance on the wind is unreal, most definitely, the biggest point in this animation.\n\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI'm not the greatest \u201cwhat you would call\u201d music master, but the tracks in this movie feel really nice. some of the emotional ones even helped blend the moment with the message displayed, makes you very reachable to the characters and their struggles, the same is said about the sound effects, they were really good, especially the arrows bumping into currents of wind before reaching their target.\r\nAnother thing was the voice actor, well, now, I watched the English DUB, and I'm not complaining, the only down thumb for me was the protagonist's voice actor, for the most \u00e2rt, it felt very lazy and sleepy whereas he should have been the least a bit excited.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nThere is nothing to see as a role model for other characters but at least it doesn't have any might-be-called annoying characters. most of the characters feel like actual humans you can relate to, they think realistically, that you are deceived they are someone you might ore likely know. another side is the character development, people change, and so do the characters in this movie, the people you see at the early parts of the movie, are completely different from the ones at the end, they adapted to what happened throughout the story, and grew even more mature.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nNow, I really liked my watch, 2 hours had passed, and I still haven't moved from my place with how much invested I was in every frame, for the most part, that was the work of the astonishing visuals, but other elements shine as well.\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nup to this point, I haven't been disappointed by any Ghibli film, and I hope it keeps up this way, this movie set up a ceiling for others to come, now, should you watch this one? if you have a couple of hours to spare, it would be a shame to pass on it, grab some popcorn, spread your legs, get comfy, and watch this great movie, have fun!\n"

But Oh boy was I lowering my guard way too much sarcastically.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nVery different from the first SS case movie, even in tone, it shifts its attention to more action, but actually nails it on the fingers just right enough for you toenjoy, even though, the beauty of the original was all in the subtle strategic 4D chess war between the inspectors and the suspects. At the very core, this movie was a war story, centering around the past of enforcer Teppei Sugou, handling our hands along his military days, past-forward to the prest day, a backstory I never thought I wanted until I was to sit through it.\r\nThe vibes of the movie Pearl Harbor were very thorough and strong, a beautiful friendship in the military, where one part goes missing in action and then assumed dead returns back to seek revenge and steer the action wheel.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nI might be going crazy, but I definitely think the animation team uped themselves in this one. A visual upgrade from the first SS case movie on every aspect, or perhaps, the much open and varying setting of this one helped deliver a better visual screening that the dark and gloomy closed mental facility of the first movie.\n\r\nSound (8.2/10):\r\nAgain with the vocal treatment. I just love the first opening and I really appreciate it being used yet again here. The featured ending song, however, was the second of the first season, which is also pretty amazing. More or less, the voice acting was just as on point in this movie, although I have to give more credit because, you know, Kougami, Kagari, and Masaoka. Yes, you know you gonna feel the excitement when each of them says as simple of a world as \u201cyes\u201d.\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\r\nWell well, I must say, this alone put this movie above the past one, and by miles.\r\nMasaoka received such a treatment, so glad that we got to see a movie-long screening of him, in a case that he took the golden flare in.\r\nVery surprising to see the past Ginoza though, I forgot how angry and Miku-like he was.\r\nAnd of course, Kougami and Kagari, man I just miss the OG team so much that I wish to forget all about this series and binge it again back to back.\r\nSugo received such a highlight during this one, I never personally cared much for him in the TV show, but now, he really shows so much growth from when he was still in the military and the resolution he came to at the end of the movie. The villain, however, was weak when it came to his motive, albeit, his and Sugo's friendship made up for the better part of the case.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI never expected anything to go past what the first movie set-up for, it seems, even in the past, there are exciting stories to tell in the franchise. I won't object to a similar treatment in the final movie.\n\r\nOverall (8.44/10):\r\nJust watch it, I'd even go as far as putting up with people for skipping the first movie just to see this one as eagerly as possible. It juts so purely good. Although it might be an unpopular opinion in the fandom, seeing that most people complained at the \u201cbad\u201d direction and how they don't like military stories, it manages to make a spin on that in my eyes, and to be frank, if not for the featuring of the OG team, the story is one that's mediocre at best and can have interchangeable events at any point and still won't make a difference.\n"

Get ready to be blown away because this is not just any ordinary ending, it's a brutal, demonic, and gory work of art that goes hand-in-hand with the show's grim themes. The color red dominates thescreen and really makes an impact.\n\r\nNow, I know that as a music video, it may be a little underwhelming to some, but let me tell you, the visuals alone make up for the lack of fire in the song. It's like a visual feast, and you'll be begging for an anime focused on the two main characters and their little girl companion. It's like a new take on Denji and Pochita, and let me tell you, it's a delightful one. So, if you're a fan of gore, animation, or just great music videos in general, Fight Song is the one for you.

The show's strengths lie in its ability to balance humor with heart, but with sixseparate episodes, that balance was thrown off.\n\r\nIn conclusion, while \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou Specials\" had its moments, it could have been a stronger and more impactful addition to the series if the six episodes were condensed into a single, more streamlined installment.\n\r\nI just wish there was a funky girls spin off in these.\n"

Sighs*\r\nBefore I start, is it just me or the Host's facial expressions are way creepier than the stories themselves?\n\r\nWell, my favorites if I had to make an ordered list,\r\n1. No Longer Human and Kokoro\r\nOh gosh, those 2, if only they had their own separate shows, I bet they would have made a hell of franchises, I just move the darkness and the backstories, the characters, the emotions, I just love everything about them, definitely hidden gems, a sold 10/10 score as easy as that.\n\r\n2. The Spider's Thread\r\nThe main character, he's got to be one of the best if not the bestcharacter ever created in a show, It just suited the story, and made it even more immersive, his look, ideology, and decisions, he's just unique, 9/10.\n\r\n3. Hell Screen\r\nProbably based on The Spider's Thread story, you can even say it's a continuation of the latter, a hellish society that was indeed, massacre and murder are committed publicly, and no one dares to oppose that cruel Emperor, a classic to say the least, 8/10.\n\r\n4. In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom\r\nNo, this could have been higher on the list, It had so much potential to be a masterpiece on its right, but, the forced humor kinda ruined it, if it was darker and ambiguous, It would have worked out even better, 8/10.\n\r\n5. Run, Melos!\r\nI couldn't relate to the story that much, probably it's the reason I didn't enjoy it as I was supposed to? Friendship ties that endured struggles throughout the years, between an actor and a writer, 7/10.\n\r\nOverall, this gets 8.6, I'd say 9/10 if it wasn't for some withdrawal along the way, totally a deep anime, more likely intended for a more mature audience, I'd definitively recommend it for adults who would like to get into anime, I'm glad I watched this, would never regret passing by, see you all, and good luck.\n"

And as a fan, it kinda hurts.\r\nThere were a lot of gaps throughout the film where I totally lost attention o the things happening as every 5 minutes I would gloss over a freaky flashback of some other Bleach filler that had some similarities of what's going on that it stopped being enjoyable before it even unfolded.\n\r\nOverall (7.26/10):\r\nWith one movie left to go, it's both sad and happy for me, for once, I get to finally set my Bleach journey to an end (at least until the Anime returns) and happy in the sense that I'm gonna finally take a break from this massive burnout I got during my binge-watch.\n"

It's no secret that the second season of the series left many fans craving more, but this musical gem manages to deliver an emotional punch that even the story couldn't quite muster.\n\r\nFirst and foremost, let's talk aesthetics. The faded crayon aesthetic of the music video is nothing short of captivating. It's as if the visuals themselves are trying to convey a sense of nostalgia, longing, and a touch ofmelancholy. In a world where the storyline fell flat for many, this music video steps up to the plate and delivers an emotional journey that feels alive, real, and profoundly realized.\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the song itself. \"Twilight Little Star\" sounds like a heartfelt letter to a past self, one burdened with unmet future expectations. It's a bittersweet melody that hits you right in the feels. ChouCho's vocals carry a sense of longing and reflection that pairs beautifully with the visual storytelling of the music video. It's a song that resonates with anyone who has ever looked back on their past and wondered about the roads not taken.\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of \"Masamune-kun no Revenge R,\" this music video may not have been the saving grace that fans were hoping for, but it's undeniably a bright spot in the twilight of the series. It manages to capture a depth of emotion and storytelling that the season itself struggled to achieve. So, if you're a fan of the series or just a lover of heartfelt music, \"Twilight Little Star\" is definitely worth a watch and a listen.\n"

A bit overkill, but watching it on the release date makes more sense.\n\r\nIn terms of a recap, 18.5 was definitely more well-motivated and properly placed on a narrative note, while this one is more of a hype-up moment for War of Underworld.\n\r\nThe recap is split into two parts, the first one focuses on Asuna and her outside perspective on the whole dilemma, while the secondpart is more about what was happening in the final battle hasn't Quinella. I really liked he first part, maybe because 18.5 (which is still fresh on my mind) already expanded on whatever happened in the underworld, so the whole scientific side of the season felt more appealing, it was great to rewatch how the series makes sense of Fluctlights and its applications.\n\r\nThe recap swiftly ends on the same cliffhanger note from before, really setting up the stage go a great spectacle.\n"

However, the conclusion was dismissed on a very weird note, as that of having the main character still not coped up with what drove his life around, which ended up having him help out others, but neglecting himself and his own struggle. Maybe helping out the other was the struggle ofhis own, or maybe, part of it, as he sorts shit on other's life, slowly, but surely, his own shit is unfolded, strap by strap, like an inter-connect riddle that leads to his own salvation. That is the stance this movie had, as the definitive conclusion of what the parent show was running after, perhaps it was for the better to isolate it away from the other \u201cbuild-up\u201d series, or perhaps it is the reason so many fans of the show won't end up watching the movie and thus sleeping on THE true book closing end of the story. And yes, I understand that the source material is still serializing, so thus far, we have only seen a snapshot of something much bigger animated, but nonetheless, the strong relation this movie has with the prequel series is something that truly takes away from an experience that while stands solidly on its own feet, could do much more having it bundled with this movie.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nThe original TV series started something very unique, very fresh and worthy of the popularity it had going for it. A classic romance story with a mystery ingredient with strong supernatural elements that have it steering the drama wheel. It revolved around several related short arcs that at the greater picture, were a mere buildup to this climactic impelling movie, a turn of events that satisfyingly puts down the writer's pen to rest on a great note.\r\nI would be lying if I called it a masterpiece, there were definitely some things that did not turn the tongue properly, but it was far from being a bad adaptation. Basically, a saga ending story arc that deals with Sakuta primarily, and the mysterious young girl from his past, Shouko.\r\nSealing my fingers from typing any major spoilers, I would say that the story went down the hill, a route I never wanted it to approached, but it still embraced it, cheaply overpassing its great struggle yet, from an outcome that would have rather ended up being depressingly sad, but would have still made more sense than the climax-canceling trump-card known as ..., well, I'll let you find that by yourself.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nThis franchise was never the \u201ceye-flaming\u201d one, where one praises the fidelity of animation before anything else. In fact, while the art style can tell it appears from a huge array of similar shows, it was never the point or direction behind this adaptation to steer a visual emotion on the viewers, no, but it was merely a complement to the story, one that's good enough to make you watch and unbothered by the mediocre visuals that it could have ended up having. I can't say that this movie did anything with that that makes the parent TV show fail to compare would be a special type of stretch. The character design is appealing enough, the background seems to match the atmosphere the story is trying to deliver, and that's about it.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nI love my Seiyuus, and this franchise has secured its place for me during the first few lines I got to hear. A show heavy on emotions naturally leans to the more experienced, dramatically talented cast of Seiyuus, and it was a marvelous introduction to even some of the new names that have left an impression big enough on me that I'm considering other series they voiced at.\r\nAside from the voice acting, the OST that fills the silence is also spot on. I would have loved to praise the hell out of the original opening and ending, but we got to heard remixes of them, well blent, almost sneaked in between some other OSTs.\n\r\nCharacters (8.2/10):\r\nArguably, one of the strongest points that the series has going for it, is how likable, and easy to relate to of a cast of characters. Koga, the chick that introduced herself in a butt-kicking exchange, or the bunny girl inducing Mai, Futaba, the pretty nerdy girl that needs every excuse to link quantum-anything to the subject of matter, and of course, the precious, needy of protection, Kaede. And that's just to name a few.\r\nSeeing, or even hearing any of the characters after such a long time brought so much nostalgia and joy that made itself aggressively visible when I was probably too focused on following what's going on the screen to realize. Just when you think you've known and dissected what the main characters are like from watching the parent show, this movie goes even deeper, showing new sides of the same characters, putting them under pressure and seeing how they overcome the situation, talking specifically about Sakuta, Mai, and the most mysterious figure from the parent show yet; Shoko, and what a reveal the series was building up for her.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nIt was both shocking and expected from me, looking back at the parent show that I had watched when it was first being aired, which also was my first seasonal binge watch that I'm still to this day trying to keep up with, so earlier series are always going to be fresh on the mind, however, seeing as it was a fall series from late 2018, that long already? I wonder what made me come back week after week when I was first watching the show, and from only the introductory scene, I was reinformed of what makes this series what it is, what sets it up from every other seasonal bootleg, sorry excuse for a light-novel adaptation, and what makes it so memorable.\r\nFrom the first second to the last, the tension was rising, the feels were manifesting, the characters made you feel their struggle, and everything that happened in the parent show proved to be more relevant and way more important than they first seemed to be, as they splendidly related to this climax, serving as the conclusive build up all along.\n\r\nOverall (8.24/10):\r\n\u201cSeishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai\u201d was one of those short sequels, shrequels, if you will, that made a fantastic tale into something even more spectacular, it adds in the topping to the juice-ngly delicious cake, a cake that's, unfortunately, nobody pays enough attention to, and as a result, end up passing up on a decision changing hidden side of story that links every bit together.\n"

Doing so will completely be missing the point from Baki, this is a grindy series, probably the only fun type of grind that never gets dull, and how can it? With the ever-growing rooster of characters that never cease to amaze.\n\r\nBaki is the ultimate anti-guilty-pleasure to watch, remove the guilty part because this shit should be broadcasted on national television. It's as if the writer read the fans mind, he gathered all lovedcharacters and rounded them against each other in a tournament so there is no excuse for anyone of them to shy down from participating in the fan service that was this season.\n\r\nThe season starts exactly from where the 2018 Baki prequel left off, no time wasted, straight to the action, it covers the Chinese 100 tournament events and the recovery of Baki after the events of the last season. I know people are not about Baki in this show, I know I'm not, because so many characters easily overshadow him with their charisma, and sometimes, strength. One of which, the one, the only, Yujiro himself, it was so surreal to see the man go off for what felt like free real estate screentime, almost illegal to think about.\n\r\nOne of the biggest upgrades in this season was the animation, it was so close to the source material and with so few CGI instances that it's hard to spot any. The use of some many well blent slow-motion shots felt so organic and fluid, almost like upgrading from a 30 Hrz monitor (Baki 2018) to a 144 Hrz (This season). It was astronomical.\n\r\nThe OST this season slapped like never before, are you kidding me with that opening and ending? I almost gave in to the curse of there never be a decent OP/ED for this series, but never again.\n\r\nThis season might just have been my favorite time spent watching Baki, it had so many heights and so few lows, it was short, fast-paced, extremely funny and so hype and exciting. The writer must have higher some majors in psychology and mathematics because the amount of careful placement and shift between events and interactions felt like the product of a years-long mathematical study, targeting precisely the finest form of entertainment. It was a blast to watch the first time, and a joy to rewatch many other times.\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10\n"

            "content": "\n                I would have never imagined myself lurking in anything Beastars related, let alone, the review section of the sequel to a show so controversial and heated by the fandom back in the day. Beastars changed something in what I expected from a show, the saying \u201cdon't judge a book by its cover\u201d was never this relatable for me. I praised the first season and to this day I keep recommending and annoying my friends about watching it, I thought it tingled the pinnacle of what it set out to be, and then the second season was released. The landscape had changed a lot since then,but a solid show always manages its footing.\n\r\nMuch like season one. Beastars 2nd season was as abrupt, as direct, and as bold in its start. It folds in the story as if the seasons were released back to back, no time wasted on pointless recaps, no primary school explaining of this, and then, we already know the characters, we already know the risks. But the destination is still as grim, mysterious, and unknown as ever. A case could be made for how the second season is an upgraded version of a yet amazing first season, but some tenacities could be brought up about the controversial ending, but that's more subjective than anything else.\n\r\nThe plotline feels more faithful and on the line of how the first season started, the murder case is more in the spotlight than ever, the characters feel more intimate and open to the audience, more so that personal strakes encompass the overarching world that outside forces seem so insignificant in the greater picture.\n\r\nThe art continues on being outstanding. It feels like an upgraded, more confident version of what was a shy attempt at exploring a medium, so risky and with no reputation in the Anime industry. 3D is always the center of heated conversations in the fandom, but Beastars feels like one of the first pillars that will eventually correct this outdated view. The versatility of 3D cinematography that CGi allows is something simply unachievable in orthodox 2d animation, it's a tool that's gone misused for so long, but in recent years, a promising future could be seen for this. Much like how some games like FarCry 1 feel like tech demos for what the future of gaming will be like, Beastars really is more than a story-based show, it's a case study on what good CGi is like. The stuff of dreams.\n\r\nOne thing that's always felt more like a highlight especially compared to conservative Anime is the sheer quality that can be felt from inspecting the audible production of the show. Season one affirmed how strong the voice acting in charge of personification the characters really are. A 3D model may look more alive than your typical 2D strokes, but it's the genuine cries that carry all the emotions are that gives character and real substance to these fictional anchors, so to say, the voice acting is the human touch that brings in life to a non-existing exaggeration of reality.\r\nThe musical score is magical, it felt like a grand scale universal production at heart. Music notes so faint sometimes, they tingle your emotion at the perfect wavelength it's insane. And don't get me started on how amazing both the opening and ending songs are, more so, the ending song, what a masterpiece.\n\r\nThe true heart of the series really lies in the characters. Often in fiction, sentient animals that talk and think are this stuff of children books, but Beastars really puts that innocent stereotype and rolls it on its head, this is no longer a savage world ruled by the rules of the forest, this is a savage world LIMITED by the rules of the forest. Beastars has got to be my favorite spin on modern society with how much it can depict the grim nature of humanity in animals, the struggle is present even in fur-covered bodies. Legos might be listed as the main character along with a few others, but we all know the real protagonists are the concepts of carnivores and herbivores all along.\n\r\nEven more so than the first season, this one managed to keep me not on my feet, but on my nails, truly a sight that makes the best of ballerinas jealous.\r\nI want to say that every episode delivered a punch so strong it hooks you in stronger, but really, each line of dialogue delivered has the same impact. You'd expect a mystery show like this would beat on the dead body of \u201cshock value\u201d to bring about a memorable legacy, but it's much stronger than that. Characters that end up on the other line of the spectrum are able to draw you in just as much as the protagonists, the line between good and evil is blurred to naught, and yet, the second-hand inner conflict you feel which watching these characters interact is an experience in and of itself.\n\r\nBeastars is that franchise that often goes unnoticed due to the feeble mentality of \u201cfurries, it must be bad\u201d. The best experiences can be found when you break out of your conform zone, not to say that Beastars tailors to the simple-minded \u201cfurry\u201d concept, it's really is a realistic outlook on society, carried out by everyday humans covered in fur, made to look like animals.\n\r\nOverall: 9.2/10\n"

It does deliver the core idea of the parent Manga but a lot of points could have been better, for example, the absence of Sister Lily, the Church, Asta, and Yuno's origins... However, you can still see similarities all over, it's a cool first concept where you wonder at what Black Clovercould have been but by no means a perfect first look.\n"

The movie captured all the elements that make Kaguya-sama so special: comedy, romance, and a sprinkle of heartfelt moments.\n\r\nOne thing that stood out was the animation quality and art, which was top-notch. The characters' expressions and exaggerated reactions brought extra humor to the already funny scenes. Additionally, seeing the Ice Kaguya arc come to life was a treat, and the added touches of Chibi Kaguya and Ice Kaguya provided insightinto Kaguya's complex character.\n\r\nThe movie took us on an emotional rollercoaster, with Kaguya and Miyuki both wrestling with their insecurities and fear of rejection. It was refreshing to see their character growth, and their eventual confession and relationship development felt satisfying and heartwarming.\n\r\nHowever, while the movie was amazing, it was a bit bittersweet to see certain aspects not included. For instance, the absence of the Ishigami Christmas party and some condensed standalone chapters left me yearning for more. But I understand the constraints of adapting a manga into a movie and appreciate what was brought to the screen.\n\r\nThe humor was on point, with hilarious scenes that had the entire theater bursting into laughter.

            "content": "\n                Yet another Demon Slayer season has arrived, and with the monumental success of its previous installment, expectations were undoubtedly high. Many fans wondered if the franchise had reached its peak and if subsequent seasons would only lead to a decline in quality. However, the latest season defies those concerns and manages to maintain the series' remarkable momentum.\n\r\nBuilding on the foundation laid by its predecessor, this season of Demon Slayer showcases the continued growth and evolution of the story, characters, and animation. It plunges viewers back into the captivating world of demon slayers, where battles against formidable adversaries and the pursuit of redemption and justice takecenter stage. The stakes are higher than ever, and the narrative explores new depths, unraveling complex plot threads and introducing intriguing revelations.\n\r\nWhile the previous season of Demon Slayer was a visual spectacle filled with intense battles, the latest installment took a different approach. It wasn't solely focused on delivering eye candy and adrenaline-pumping fights, but it certainly didn't disappoint. In fact, it managed to hold its own and captivate viewers in a different way.\n\r\nOne notable aspect of this season was the emphasis on teamwork and the genuine camaraderie among the characters. The tag team dynamic became a prominent feature, allowing the audience to witness the combined efforts and strategic collaborations of the demon slayers. This shift in focus from individual battles to cooperative action added depth and complexity to the fight sequences, showcasing the synergy and unity among the characters.\n\r\nIn addition to the well-executed action scenes, the character interactions became a highlight of this season. The writers skillfully crafted moments of genuine chemistry and connection between the characters, further enriching the overall narrative. The reintroduction of Genya and the introduction of two new Hashira injected fresh energy into the story. Their presence brought a renewed sense of intrigue and expanded the world of Demon Slayer, providing new perspectives and dynamics within the cast.\n\r\nInterestingly, the absence of Zenitsu and Inosuke, two characters who divided opinions among fans, allowed the spotlight to shine on other members of the ensemble. This shift provided an opportunity for viewers to appreciate the depth and complexity of the remaining characters, particularly Tanjiro and his interactions with Genya. The contrast between the two characters created a captivating dynamic that added depth to the story and shed light on aspects that were previously overlooked.\n\r\nBy exploring new character dynamics and relationships, the season breathed new life into the series, rekindling the excitement and interest of viewers. It demonstrated that Demon Slayer is not solely reliant on specific characters to carry the story but has a rich ensemble capable of captivating audiences in different ways.\n\r\nIn the end, while the battle fest and eye candy elements may have taken a backseat in this season of Demon Slayer, it compensated with its focus on teamwork, character interactions, and the introduction of intriguing new additions to the cast. It proved that the series can evolve and explore different facets of its universe while still maintaining its allure and appeal. The absence of certain characters allowed for fresh perspectives and a renewed appreciation for the depth and complexity of the remaining cast members.\n\r\nWhile the previous season of the show was undeniably masterful in many aspects, it did have a weak introduction and an ending that left something to be desired. It started off without much fanfare, lacking the gripping opening that immediately grabs the viewers' attention. It took some time to build up momentum and find its footing, gradually escalating the stakes and tension as the story progressed. However, it was during the climax that the season truly shone, reaching a high peak that left audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\r\nIn contrast, the current season wasted no time in making its presence felt. It burst onto the screen with an explosive start, captivating viewers right from the first episode. The pacing was relentless, maintaining a sense of urgency and excitement throughout the entire season. The story wasted no time in diving into the heart of the action, immersing the audience in a thrilling and engaging narrative that never seemed to slow down.\n\r\nFurthermore, the season's ending proved to be a significant improvement over its predecessor. Instead of ending abruptly or leaving loose ends, it provided a satisfying and well-crafted conclusion. The narrative threads were neatly tied together, giving a sense of closure and resolution to the overarching storylines. The final episodes were packed with emotional moments, impactful character development, and pivotal revelations that left a lasting impact on the viewers.\n\r\nIn fact, the season's ending was on par with the impressive wrap-up seen in the franchise's movie. It provided a fitting culmination to the events that had unfolded throughout the season, leaving viewers with a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. The conclusion managed to strike the right balance between tying up loose ends and leaving room for future possibilities, ensuring that audiences were left with a sense of anticipation for what's to come.\n\r\nThis improved introduction and ending showcased the growth and refinement of the storytelling within the franchise. It demonstrated that the creators had listened to the feedback and learned from past seasons, delivering a more coherent and impactful narrative structure. The season started strong, capturing the audience's attention from the get-go, and it concluded with a sense of closure and excitement that left viewers eagerly awaiting the next installment.\n\r\nIn summary, the current season of the show addressed the weaknesses of its predecessor by delivering a captivating and engaging start that immediately drew viewers in. It maintained a relentless pace throughout, never losing its momentum or sacrificing the quality of storytelling. Most importantly, it concluded with a satisfying wrap-up, surpassing the previous season's ending and coming close to the excellence seen in the franchise's movie. This season's strong introduction and well-crafted conclusion showcased the growth and evolution of the series, leaving fans eager to see what the future holds for their beloved characters and the captivating world they inhabit.\n\r\nOverall: 8.44/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Think of this as one of those silly green text shorts, without the greenish color, and without the context-free expressions, just one fleshed out and fancy green text story in disguise that goes into mocking a helpless child, an orphan from the depth of a global conflict, one that's been enslaved ever since his/her first breath and remains to being enslaved by his/her shadow leaders in hopes to create a war machine out of his/her innocence.\n\r\nEverybody has a loved one involved in a war in some way, everyone would rather sacrifice a stranger in the stead of one of their relatives, making that one orphana rat in the eyes of not only the enemy but also the people he/she is meant to protect. Nobody wants anything to do with a bloodstained slave, somebody whose hands went greasy with all the oily bombshells they keep feeding those overused canons, a hand that's split numerous throat is something nobody wants to willingly shake nor meet its master.\n\r\nMuch like your old shoes, you either give them to somebody else to use until they completely wear off, or you throw them at the bottom of a trash can to rot with not a single sweat. But what if the orphan was given a chance in a world he/she never knew existed, aside from the smoky and dark skies, intoxicated with the deadly chemical poisons that are regarded as the work of the devil even in the most horrifying of wars, his/her young eyes never have seen. A rainbow enveloping the open blue sky at the end of every other rainy day must be nothing other than a magical myth for his/her imagination that idolized explosions and their colorful sight. For someone, who's been raised and disciplined by a strict military hand wouldn't understand why those other kids of his/her age are doing that weird expression of their face that has them stretch their mouths in a strange way across their faces with a mysterious eye squeeze while holding a grown up's hand. \u201cThat must be his master\u201d, the orphan wonders.\n\r\nClearly, stepping into a territory populated with these alien ideas must be unimaginably hard to adapt to, going nuts for not receiving any orders in a while would have drug effect-like syndromes. Converting your whole lifestyle is never easy, and so is writing down an honest letter.\n\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nIn a suspiciously Europe like land stuck in an era of conflicts, a child embodies the orphan spoken about earlier, bearing the name \u201cViolet\u201d has finally wrapped a huge chapter of her life and is forcibly introduced to a world she never asked to be in, a world where birds replaced the bullet lullaby she's grown used to in her time in the military. Flowers and vegetation took the place of minded fields, and those seemingly fallen soldiers on the ground are all somehow as lifely as one can get.\n\r\nThe narrative follows that girl Violet in her journey of converting from a war weapon to exactly the opposite of what she used to be, those stained hands that have ripped many hearts straight from their bodies are now writing letters that help carry many people's emotion to the individual they need to reach. As she accepts this duty as just another mission for an order-begging tool as what everybody used to call her in the military, she grows to be more of a human than ever.\n\r\nViolet Evergarden did a lot of things splendidly, but it was worth noting its bearable slow-paced plot that wasn't really a problem but it needed to be pointed out. As it follows Violet as an individual, it also packs up a lot of other self-contained stories that help Violet in reaching her goal while also introducing other people and expands on their problems and suffering.\r\nAnd those were all easily relatable and simple enough for everybody to follow, from a dying mother to a grieving father, all of those distant childhood friends and those famous war love stories, a million words worth of feeling can magically be put into a single piece of paper and wrapped in an envelope shaping a meaningful letter.\n\r\nWhile some stories were tear-jerking and really stand out solidly as their own self-contained arc, a handful others were kind of meh, there was a great attempt in delivering the feels that you'd expect from a show like this, but it gets over dramatic very easily it kind of gets predictable and tiring.\r\nThe concept that the story comes with however is very intriguing, while at that conflict fueled era, not a lot of educated people were crawling the streets, especially with a high dead bar as that, so a group of women with an impressive literature background and a solid number of vocabulary offers a variety of ghostwriting services, with a flashy title that spells \u201cAuto Memoir Doll Service\u201d, it encapsulates Violet especially very good with her Doll looking appearance and even contracts what she used to be viewed us, nothing more than a heartless mannequin.\n\n\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nIt's definitely something you don't see every day. At least visually speaking, Violet Evergarden stands very high on the scale. It does everything write on the visual level. And most of that is achieved mainly by its breathtaking artwork and the scalable art style.\n\r\nA lot of people call it the best-animated Anime ever, but that's where they are wrong. First and before anything. Animation is not artwork, and it's the latter what Violet Evergarden excels at. Fluid animation is something you would pair shows like Shingeki no Kyojin, One Punch Man, Space Dandy with, it's all on those lively frames, the camera movements, everything about the cinematography. But Violet masters something else, something that's neglected most of the time and only famous among big movie production, something I like to call the art of still images.\n\r\nThere is a certain beauty in every frame, you're guaranteed to take a high-quality wallpaper worthy screenshot whenever you pause the episode you're watching. I could stare at still shots from the show for a long time and there is immense satisfaction and enjoyment in doing solely that, I always find myself complaining about major flaws in character anatomy and weird facial expressions, but never with Violet Evergarden, it is certainly the best treat my eye has received consistency wise. Not even a single episode fell short on delivering the same level of quality, even movies seem to lower that at some parts. If this show was a cake, it would have been the tastiest my eyes have ever eaten.\n\r\nIt feels really weird when I have to put this into words, one obvious reason would be in my inferior writing skills compared to a world-renowned writer like Violet herself, but it makes you beg for more content so simple as another casual introduction, as she leans forward bowing her head, and the fresh breeze blows lightly her hair and every portion of the grassy ground starts dancing along with the complimentary blow of air.\r\nEven the way shiny surfaces reflect their environment or how a fallen leaf can bright so much life and peacefulness when it distorts a still and calm lake, it makes you want to leave your house and drive somewhere similar where you can appreciate nature as you please.\n\r\nThere is also the excellent alternation between bright and dark colors as they are utilized to highlight the current tone of the plot, as, of course, in the battlefield, it's all gloomy and down looking, most of the time pretty dark and horrifying, but as soon as they tone shifts off, it's suddenly all colorful and happy all around, and their pretty eyes portray that perfectly.\n\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nTalking media-wise, a sound stream is a judge between a bundle of animated frames being either a GIF or a video, while looking at a beach scene, however beautiful it may be, it wouldn't come close to an alteration of itself with a fitting collection of sound to accompany those waves.\r\nViolet Evergarden isn't just visually phenomenal, it's also vocally near that level.\n\r\nFor me at least, I wouldn't have been able to come up with a better voice acting cast to carry on this trippy journey, it needs something that standouts, this is a story that requires a handful effort to deliver the heartbreaking dialog and eye beating facial expressions and it feels that Violet Evergarden the show has been blessed with a cutting edge vocal performance of a high production value. That concerns even the most irrelevant spoken character to Violet herself (Voiced by Ishikawa Yui that also did Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin).\n\r\nDon't be surprised if you ever noticed that this show's opening and ending theme songs always make it in those popular Anime opening quizzes videos because God do they stand up.\r\nThe opening sequence starts up slowly with a delicate voice that feels like a narrator of its own story portrayed by the opening's visuals, but it's debatable whether or not it contains spoilers, it definitely prepares you mentally for the rollercoaster content in the said episode.\r\nThe end sequence is just as good, while not every episode ends on a sad notice, the ending song does worsen the mood in a good way as it only reminds you to have some more tissues ready for the next episode.\n\r\nThe soundtrack collections was just so good, it has a slight Victorian vibe to it and it works amazingly with the mood of the story, although, sometimes the music choice of certain moments wasn't the best, not that the show was lacking in fitting tracks it was just the bad timing and horrible pair between an animated scene and a soundtrack that did the scene more damage than refinement.\n\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\r\nIf there was anything Violet Evergarden lacked, it was a more interesting character cast. I'll cut the show some slack for being an episodic narration of a bigger story that most of the time involves one-time characters that we are likely to never hear from or seen ever again, but that doesn't cover the main cast, the ones that steer the series and contribute to its progression.\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Violet has had great character development, seeing her start off from scratch like a newborn baby, it made it easy to see Violet reaching a new level of enlightenment, it's always those small details, like seeing Violet spare some genuin sad tears or crack a wide smile, it felt like hitting a milestone and gives off that warm motherly feeling. You get to see her grow from more than a spectator's view.\n\r\nAside from Violet, other supporting characters have had their moments with some even having their standalone focused episodes, but what about the rest? There were a lot of great opportunities to elaboration on some love interests between other characters, some even had that protagonist look that teases you to ask for more, but you only get left off at the end with no appreciated delivery.\n\r\nThe show did a decent job when it came to the \u201cbad guy\u201d. It was never about a bad dude with a long cloak and a dramatic evil laugh, it felt more like Violet going against her past, even the supposedly bad people become more approachable and likable as the plot pealed their top skin and gave them more context, it really was a story about one girl as the show's title suggests, but it still carried on all of those side stories nevertheless.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nMy experience with Violet Evergarden could have been very different given the pace I'd take, and I believe, one's enjoyment would really vary given how they decide to watch it, go full out in one sit binging every episode like there's no tomorrow, or watching every episode individually with a break in between every episode. I went with the latter and I'm glad I did.\r\nI do believe an episode a day or every three days would be the ideal approach of watching the series as it differs a lot from most shows. It follows a strict episodic pattern, every episode is self-contained and tackles its own pace, so no need to rush in there.\n\r\nSometimes after completing an episode, you're just that invested with all of the displayed emotions, you just want to take it easy and have a break, reflect on the episode, take a deeper dive into the concepts it involves and think about all sorts of conclusions, it really helps connect with the mini-stories and characters a lot better, and also lightens the strains on your eyes, if you're easy to drop tears, don't be harsh on yourself, make yourself a favor and take your time.\n\r\nI feel like I need to express more on how amazing the visuals were, to me, that's a pretty high ceiling to be the ruler for my reviews from now on. The voice acting is sharp and on point, the pacing is a bit slow and very bearable given the eye candy that fills your screen. It's not the best re-watch worthy show out there, I'm sure it would be some time until I decide to re-watch this again, sometimes when I had forgotten most of the plot, it's never as good as when you first experience it that's for sure.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.3/10):\r\nViolet Evergarden is a great show, I wouldn't go as far as most people and call it a masterpiece, as it still has some minor flaws that could have been easily avoided, but it stands out on top of many other shows in some areas even being scored lower than them in general.\n\r\nIf you're expecting romance, you'll be left disappointed, it does tackle concepts like love, but the story's primary message was never about that.\r\nIf you do enjoy redemption stories, starting off fresh and aiming for the top, I'd highly recommend you clear out a spot every once in a while with at least two tissues next to you and a backup for last resort. Make sure however you don't watch it all in one take, it really takes off a lot from the experience, as the more you reflect on a mini-story, the more it grows on you.\n"

            "content": "\n                Solo Leveling - A Thrilling Journey with Peaks and Valleys\n\r\nSolo Leveling, a Manhwa that I stumbled upon during a wisdom teeth pain, quickly became my go-to escape and source of enjoyment. The captivating art style and vibrant colors provided a visual feast that made every panel a delight to behold. The vertical paneling format was a perfect fit for the story, enhancing the reading experience and drawing me deeper into its world.\n\r\nWhile Sung Jin Woo may not be the most complex or grounded character, he served as a fantastic protagonist, offering a much-needed respite from reality. However, it was the side characters that truly stolethe spotlight. Like in One Punch Man, their presence and interactions added depth and substance to the story, leaving me craving for more.\n\r\nThe initial 80 chapters of Solo Leveling were particularly impressive, setting a high standard that the series had to maintain. The small-scale scope and significant risks created an intriguing narrative, and the mystery surrounding \"the system\" sparked my curiosity, keeping me invested in the story's progression.\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that some people dismiss Solo Leveling as a mere imitation of other great works, particularly during the Jeju Island Raid arc. While it may have drawn inspiration from Hunter x Hunter and similar series, Solo Leveling managed to carve out its own identity and deliver an enjoyable experience.\n\r\nHowever, I must admit that as the series progressed and approached its endgame, I found it to be somewhat underwhelming and repetitive. The introduction of the Monarchs overshadowed the side characters, rendering them irrelevant in the face of these formidable threats. The ending, in my opinion, felt rushed and lacked the excitement and intrigue that the series had built up over time. Undoubtedly, the peak of Solo Leveling was in its earlier chapters, where the story was at its most captivating.\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Solo Leveling remains a thrilling journey worth embarking upon. The remarkable art, compelling protagonist, and memorable side characters make it a Manhwa that stands out in the crowded landscape of the genre. It may not have maintained the same level of excellence throughout its entirety, but the high points it reached in the first part of the series make it a memorable and enjoyable read.\n"

            "content": "\n                Guilty Crown was a show that had a lot of potentials. The premise of a resistance group fighting against a tyrannical government in a post-apocalyptic world is a classic one, and the show's animation and music were certainly top-notch. Unfortunately, that's about where the praise ends.\n\r\nThe pacing of the show was painfully slow, with the first half of the series feeling more like a dragged-out setup for the real story. The characters were one-dimensional and bland, with the protagonist Shuu Ouma being nothing more than a typical shounen hero with no real development or depth. The show's attempts at making biblical references were cringy andfell flat, coming across as forced and out of place.\n\r\nThe story itself was riddled with inconsistencies and plot holes, with the show's second half devolving into a mess of convoluted twists and nonsensical plot developments. The characters' motivations and actions often made little sense, and the show's attempts at tackling heavy themes such as oppression and power were surface-level at best.\n\r\nEven the animation, which was one of the show's strengths, hasn't aged well over the past decade. The character designs and action scenes feel dated compared to more recent anime, and the animation as a whole comes across as stiff and uninspired. The only thing that \"Guilty Crown\" truly excels at is its music and OST, which are still some of the best out there. But even that isn't enough to save the show from its numerous shortcomings.\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters of \"Guilty Crown,\" it's hard to find much to say that's positive. The protagonist, Shuu Ouma, is a prime example of this. He starts off as a socially awkward and unassuming high school student, but as soon as he gets his hands on the \"Power of the Kings,\" he suddenly becomes this overpowered, brooding hero with little to no character development. He's a classic case of a \"wish fulfillment\" protagonist, but without any of the charm or likability that often comes with that trope.\n\r\nThe same can be said for many of the other characters as well. Gai Tsutsugami, the leader of the Funeral Parlor, is your typical \"cool and charismatic\" leader of a rebellion, but he doesn't have much depth beyond that. Inori Yuzuriha, the female lead, is a bit more interesting, but her character arc is predictable and uninspired. The supporting cast is equally underwhelming, with most of them being one-dimensional stereotypes.\n\r\nWhat's even more disappointing is that the characters don't really have any chemistry with each other. The romantic subplot between Shuu and Inori is especially jarring, as it feels like it's thrown in just for the sake of having one, without any real emotional connection between the two.\n\r\nIt's a shame that such a big budget and effort was put into this series and yet the characters are so weak, it's hard to care about their plights. Even by the standards of anime a decade ago, these characters were not that well written. There were more for a cancer to this franchise than the Void virus.\n\r\nOverall: 6.68/10.\n"

In case you're still not finished with the main storyline, just give this your back and come back some other time, that is, in case you still insist on giving this a shot.\n\r\n\u201cSometimes I wonder what's behind---\u201d, that's a good lyric from Glassy Sky, an amazing soundtrack from Tokyo Ghoul, but that's beyond the scoop of these few paragraphs. I really don't fully understand why is this a standalone thing and what were they intending from it to be.\r\nAll, in short, it's looking tobe somewhere after the events of the two major installments of the franchise, after Lelouch and Suzaku are presumably \u201cdead\u201d and they happened to get caught by some stupid mistake in a very humorous and unserious way. They were talking and hitting towards a new upcoming series, so I don't know if that was a sneaky advertisement to something to come?!\n\r\n- Art (2/10):\r\nVery lazy and deformed, not event in a noticeable Chibi style, they all looked like an elementary school drawing with no motion what so ever, like a play carved onto card piece and being moved statically by hand with no depth to them.\n\r\n- Sound (1/10):\r\nThere was literally none, no soundtracks, no voice acting, nothing but pointless sound effects, nothing to give more context at all.\n\r\n- Enjoyment: (4/10):\r\nHuge mixed up feelings about this, I really don't get the core idea but still appreciated the second sighting of humourous Code Geass characters. Probably the strongest thing this got going on is its short length, otherwise, it would have been a torture to sit through it all.\n\r\n- Overall (2.3/10):\r\nUnless you were that eager to get into this, there is nothing of value in seeing it other than waste another 3 minutes of your life, and life is very expensive.\n"

            "content": "\n                Throughout its +20 years of serialization, One Piece has had in its collection of extras some of the greatest movies and OVAs, but, of course, there is always room for some trash. The trend of episodes, a weird hybrid that resides between an OVA/Special in nature and a movie with its lengthy spanning where they go down their road into recapping certain story arcs, a very financially effective method of making money while still receiving minimal complaints from the fans. We all have our own favorite story arcs in One Piece, and having it the massive weekly shounen it is, the animation quality isn't alwaysthe best and thus making us beg for remakes of several moments of the story, that's what these specials were good for, however, they are not always satisfying, and at times, they only create more controversy that nobody wants.\r\nOne Piece: Episode of Merry - Mou Hitori no Nakama no Monogatari is one of those special episodes that happens to cover up the events of Water 7 and Enies Lobby, two of the greatest and most beloved story arcs of One Piece, praised by many fans to be the greatest in the series, and you know when something is about to ruin a crucial part of a story you love, it's riot time.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nIt was just another sunny day in the new world where Brook, Usopp, and Chopper decided to go for a stroll in the mini Merry when suddenly Usopp decided it was story time, and so the retelling of the Water 7 saga began for the purpose of letting Brook know more about the Going Merry, the ship that held the Straw Hats into the grand line that far, the ship that he missed upon as a crew member.\r\nIn term of the pacing, it was just incredible, no extra splashed unwanted filler or nothing of that nature, very concise and straight to the point, it lets you focus on what's important, on how the Merry was played in the center of all the drama that was going on at the time. They obviously had some considerable amount of flashbacks, not only is the special based on one, they even went ahead and pull off an episode one to water 7 recap, trying to remind us of how the Merry was cherished and cared for, and how beat downs it had to go through in order to carry its beloved crew sailors.\r\nSome dialogue has been slightly altered which led to a different vibe from some big moments, like the Luffy and Usopp's fight it still had that same impact of sorrow and defeat but also felt a bit less intense as the original adaptation.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nProbably the most expected thing about this kind of animation is the updated animation and art style, all the fans know this already, the Water 7 saga had probably one of if not the best animation quality in the entire series (In my opinion, second only to Thriller Bark), and as we say in the world of development, if it compiles, don't touch it. The animation in term of fluidity was just as good, but the general look of characters and their design still felt a lot odd and overdone. Like, for instance, all the characters had this weird plastic-ish feel on their skin, so smooth it reflects light more so than a mirror, you could swear they had the characters take an ice bucket challenge, the only twist being it was soap instead of ice, for me, that was a big turn off, like you'd get Franky exposed to some great scale explosion and still keep his skin intact, as smooth as any crappy overplayed skin-care product commercial.\r\nOne other big thing that many people disagree with, including me, is the over-exaggerated sexual references, let's be honest, no woman with hips as thin as those can maintain her balance with those gigantic melons holding her chest down, Toei, go easy on us, please.\n\r\n- Sound (8.2/10):\r\nI really don't have to go any deeper in this category, I feel like One Piece, more than any other long-running weekly shounen has always had the most dedicated voice acing team, with an amazing quality performance during its +20 years in production, if there was anything lacking in terms of animation, the audio makes up for it, for the most part.\r\nNot only that, but the killer classic soundtracks are also of great presence, almost a character of their own. One of the highlights was probably the showcase of a more updated version of Memories (the first ending theme song) at the end.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nWater 7 was a great step for One Piece as a series, not only it was the peak of its hype at the time, but the characters have had major upgrades aside from their syncing powerups. There was Robin deciding to believe in her crew member, Luffy taking bigger responsibilities and making gamer changing decisions as a captain, and Usopp facing up his cowardly side and accepting the fact that he has to move on. A lot of other great moments for Sanji, Nami, Zoro... and Merry. Yes, she was always a character.\r\nSpandam managed to remind us of just how much of a scumbag he really was, playing that role and being that convincing is tough.\r\nOf course, we get to see some more CP9 action, with the iconic Lucci showdown at the end.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI would differently confirm this to be the best special episode that's currently in One Piece's wide collection of entertaining content, it really managed to live up to the hype unlike a lot of other similar animations.\r\nAll the fights have been remastered, it was a great reminder of how powerful CP9 was, it seems that lately with all of the crazy power levels the entire crew has had, looking back on the much simpler times really shows how much they've grown.\n\r\n- Overall (8.04/10):\r\nIf anything, out of all the other special episodes, this is the one with the greatest value of re-watch-ability for what quality it packs up, I really encourage the fans especially to give this a spare of a couple of hours, it's both a great recap of a past great arc and a new experience to behold, the fights still were the same, but the new animation added so much.\n"

            "content": "\n                Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Season 2 was a series that I had mixed feelings about. Having watched the first season and being underwhelmed by it, I was hesitant to give the second season a try. However, I decided to give it a chance and see if it could redeem itself, and while it did improve in some aspects, it still had many flaws.\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable improvements in this season was the animation quality. While it was still not on par with other shows in the same genre, it was definitely an improvement from the first season. The battles were more dynamic andthe character designs were more consistent. Additionally, the opening and ending themes were absolute bangers and I found myself jamming to them every time I heard them.\n\r\nHowever, despite the animation being better, the characters were still one-dimensional and the plot was lackluster. Hajime, the protagonist, was still annoying and perverted, and while his backstory was explored more in-depth, it did little to make him a more likable character. The other characters in his group, while given some more development, still felt flat and uninteresting. The plot felt rushed and underdeveloped, with the writers seemingly cramming in as much action as possible without giving enough time for proper buildup. another issue with this season is the excessive amount of fan service, which is more annoying and perverted than I remembered from the previous season. It just felt like the show was trying too hard to pander to a certain audience rather than focusing on the plot and character development.\n\r\nOverall, while Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou Season 2 had its moments, it still fell short of my expectations. The improved animation and music were a step in the right direction, but the weak characters and plot prevented me from fully enjoying the show. I would give this season a rating of 4.5/10, mainly because of the improvement in animation and the catchy opening and ending themes.\n\r\nOverall: 4.5/10.\n"

At first, I didn't like the art style that much, but later, I realized how fitting it is for this kind of stories, It really really helped evaluate the plot in some ways,\n\r\n-Characters (10/10)\r\nFinding a show where all characters are individually unique is very very hard, most of the time you are concerned about the main characters and their struggles, but in this story, you seem to have interests in some side characters too, for example, Steeves, Al, Monica, and so on, the support characters are just as interesting, Hakim, Grace...\r\nAs much as I hated Viscount's ideology, I find him to be a fit antagonist to the series, with his hatred and ego topping even his fellow class members\n\r\n-Music (10/10)\r\nDon't you get me started on this one, The opening, the ending, the OST are just awesome, I find myself get moved only by the soundtracks that are played accordingly and perfect, they reflect the scene's mood, and help let you reach the characters' feelings and thoughts\n\r\nOverall, This is a 10/10 show, I'd definitely recommend it for Romance stories fans, I just highly praise it for what it is, I remained pure and innocent, true to its self till the end.\n"

            "content": "\n                Greetings, fellow denizens of Nazarick! It's time to dive back into the world of Overlord with the highly anticipated fourth season. And let me tell you, this season is so good, it's almost like Ainz Ooal Gown himself cast a spell on the anime industry to make it happen. But enough with the jokes - let's get down to business and see if this latest installment of the beloved franchise is worth your time and guild funds.\n\r\nOverlord IV picks up right where the previous season left off, with Ainz Ooal Gown reigning supreme as the Sorcerer King and Albedo being sent to the human capitalof E-Rantel to serve as a diplomatic envoy. The plot quickly takes a turn as the Sorcerer Kingdom faces a dire shortage of goods and Albedo's attempts at diplomacy are met with suspicion and fear from the human population. Meanwhile, the Slane Theocracy is plotting to take revenge against Ainz for his attack on the Re-Estize Kingdom's army, leading to a confrontation between Ainz and the emperor of the Baharuth Empire.\n\r\nThe pacing in this season is quite well-done, with each episode bringing new developments to the story and a good balance of action and dialogue. The plot threads from previous seasons are resolved in satisfying ways, with many mysteries and plot devices being explained and fleshed out.\n\r\nOne of the strengths of Overlord IV is its focus on character development, as we get to see more of the personalities and motivations of both the main characters and the supporting cast. The season also introduces several new characters who add interesting dynamics to the story.\n\r\nThe animation and OSTs in Overlord IV were top-notch. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and the animation was fluid and dynamic. The character designs were as detailed and striking as ever, and the backgrounds were breathtakingly detailed. The OSTs were also amazing and added an extra layer of depth and emotion to the scenes.\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, Overlord IV did a great job of further developing the characters we know and love, while also introducing new characters that added to the overall story. The pacing was also much better than in previous seasons, with the story moving at a brisk pace without sacrificing important character moments or world-building.\n\r\nOne of the things I loved about this season was how many loose ends were tied up and how many plot devices were resolved. The story felt more cohesive and satisfying than in previous seasons, with everything building towards a climactic finale that left me on the edge of my seat. Overall, I enjoyed Overlord IV even more than the previous seasons, and I can't wait to see where the story goes next.\n\r\nOverall, Overlord IV is a solid continuation of the series, with a well-crafted plot, engaging characters, and satisfying resolutions to previous storylines. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed.\n\r\nOverall: 8.58/10.\n"

Since the first ever animated movies were a thing, the medium has known massive changes, and if we would compare what we have nowadays with what came first, the differences would be shockingly massive. What primarily cause these differences are is culture influence, and that's a variable that changes every now and then.\n\r\n- Story (1.0/10):\r\nKuro Nyago tells a short tale of four brothers to get told by two cats that they are descendants of some tabby tiger, that sounds like something any underdeveloped toddler can come up with. But seeinghow many Japanese folklore fables got to get animated first in that fashion makes a perfect excuse for the odd nature of this short.\n\r\n- Art (1.0/10):\r\nI going to be hard on this one, I do understand the rough aging this animation came through, but in term of its quality, it doesn't hold a single bit for today's standards. The movements felt very static, as simple as moving a still image in 5 FPS at best.\n\r\n- Sound (3.0/10):\r\nFor being a musical, I gotta give it a solid score for being catchy as old as it is, but the quality was still horrible, I can already feel the pain the translators went through to make out what they were saying as all I could hear was distorted cat noises ironically enough. Unless it was in fact translated by a secret regiment of cats ruling us from the shadows.\n\r\n- Character (0.0/10):\r\nWell, other than four human figures that are all identical in form, and in complete sync in movements, they were all quibbling about getting a cat, so that also makes it clear they have the same likes. It all sounds like an easy copypasta in more than appearance.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (2.0/10):\r\n\u201cWhy are we here? Just to suffer?\u201d that was me all the time watching the short begging for it to end as soon as possible. There was zero catch for me at the end other than getting the tone stuck to my head for how catchy it was.\n\r\n- Overall (1.4/10):\r\nThere's no way I would recommend this outdated piece of work unless somebody was super interested in some old Japanese animations, I don't know how successful this was in its time, but if it was that big, then the tastes of people have come to know a massive development. Many would call it creepy in the modern day, but I kind of understand what was behind it back in the day.\n"

I tend to gravitate toward shows that are serene, self-contained, and not overly convoluted. But, upon its airing, Mushoku Tensei proved to be a force to be reckoned with, an anime that was impossible to ignore. The fanfare surrounding it was palpable, with many hailing it as \"the forefather of modern Isekai\" and \"the genesis of the genre\". But, as is my wont, I prefer to form my own opinions, rather than be swayed by the hype. And I am glad I did so with this show.\n\r\nMushoku Tensei is a fantasticand refreshing take on the Isekai genre. The show's pacing, world-building, and character development are top-notch, making it a true standout in the crowded field of fantasy anime.\n\r\nI shall not be a sycophantic NPC, blindly praising the show despite its many merits. It began with an invented language, which, when you consider the premise of the story, makes perfect sense. The pacing is another aspect that I found to be exceptional - it was brisk, yet not overly so. The frequent use of time skips served to further the narrative and the character development was superb, with the protagonist, in particular, being a complex and nuanced character with many redeeming qualities. And, speaking of pacing, the show made clever use of its limited 23 minutes of airtime by interspersing shots of landscapes and characters in their everyday lives during the openings, building up the world in a subtle and effective manner. I found this to be a delightful quirk of the show.\n\r\nBut, as with any work of fiction, there were aspects that I found to be less than satisfactory. The protagonist, for one, was at times both creepy and disturbingly off-putting. The show seemed to revel in depicting his past life as a scumbag, with instances of child grooming, rape, and sexual assault being depicted in graphic detail. It felt gratuitous and unnecessary and detracted from the overall narrative. And then there is the animation, which, while being visually stunning at times, was too good to be true. Especially for an Isekai, this level of animation is rare, and I hope it becomes the norm. The fantasy worlds depicted in the genre have the potential to be so much more than what we are used to seeing, and Mushoku Tensei truly hit the jackpot in this regard.\n\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of Mushoku Tensei was its ability to seamlessly blend slice-of-life elements with fantasy and adventure. The first half of the series was especially effective in this regard, as it delved into the daily lives of its characters and their struggles to adapt to their new world. The show was able to create a sense of immersion and relatability that was truly captivating and made it easy for the audience to become invested in the story and its characters.\n\r\nHowever, as the series progressed, it began to shift away from its slice-of-life roots and increasingly focused on action and adventure. While these elements were certainly exciting, they felt somewhat out of place and disconnected from the more grounded and relatable first half of the series. The show began to feel like just another generic Isekai, and it became increasingly difficult to stay engaged with the story as it progressed.\n\r\nIn particular, the second half of the series felt oversaturated with the typical tropes and cliches of the Isekai genre and failed to bring anything new or unique to the table. The pacing became slower, the plot became more convoluted and less focused, and the characters were less well-developed. Ultimately, it felt like the show was trying too hard to appeal to the typical Isekai audience, and lost sight of what made it so special in the first place.\n\r\nAll in all, Mushoku Tensei was a show that had the potential to be truly great, but ultimately fell short of its potential. It was at its best when it was focused on slice-of-life elements, but as it shifted towards action and adventure, it became bogged down by the over-saturation of the genre and lost its charm. It is still a show that is worth watching, but it is important to keep in mind that it's not as great as it could have been.\n\r\nOverall: 8.1/10.\n"

Charlotte: Tsuyoimono-tachi, aired the 30th Mars 2016 is a special one-shot episode that exists just for that, to feed the hungry fans. But does it taste good?\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nThe special episode follows the student council as they are trying to solve a problem with a mind reader that can't seem to turn off her ability, and thus makingeverybody around her fight. Nao and Yuu set up to helping her of course while keeping a close distance from her, they start to read each other's minds as a means to get to know one another the best, but it doesn't go as smooth as one might expect.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nJust like the parent series, I can't seem to remember a flaw I encounter, a dragged on anatomy or right animation, it was a good Charlotte/10. The character design for the mind reader was great though, so detailed that she could have a show of her own as a protagonist.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nI've never been a huge fan of the main cast, to begin with, especial as soon as I discovered that Nao has the same voice actress of Gasper (High School DxD), and you know, I'm not big on traps either.\r\nIt was cool for me to get to see the opening theme song again, but I guess that was it.\n\r\n- Character (6.5/10):\r\nAs I've always said, this show lacks consistency when it comes to the characters as 95% of them are not memorable at all, and I've seen short series do better, for instance, FLCL, leaving no excuse for Charlotte to slack off. Nothing too special seemed to happen here aside from the protagonist being more of a punching bag than he was during the main show.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nNot my proudest special watch, to be honest, it was almost like being forced to stare at drying paint while not having slept for days, it was hard to keep up as nothing interesting in particular was hitting the spot, I could go for hours starring at the Whole Cake chateau collapsing (One Piece) and not get this bored, it was just another standalone episode that couldn't even stand on its own.\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\r\nIf you have something better to do, just skip over on this, absolutely nothing happens in favor of progressing the plot as this is not a sequel, and it's set somewhere between the third and sixth episode, right after Yusarin joined, but before *SPOILER AHEAD*; Ayumi passed away.\n"

With unique storytelling methods, it can get really confusing as it keeps jumping between multiple timelines and places with no prior warning, focusing on way more characters than the average Fred can keep up with (no offense in here).\r\nThe narrative in Baccano! is a character in itself, the main one, in fact, you see what he or she sees, hear what they hear, and think what they think.\r\nThe main 4 time periods the series focuses on have more characters and motives in common than the digits they are formed by, makes you wonder how 1711, 1930, 1931, and 1932 can all be connected in a much deeper scale, the shift on focus can be very staggering at times where you would switch settings on the most intense and climactic moments going back and forth between the multiple time and spaces.\r\nThis is a series that requires immense attention and focus, dropping a single friction of care might lead you to slip up on some important detail that might turn up to be crucial to link the events together. Despite covering more than one time period, the Victorian New York vibe is the one that has the strongest presence for what it involves of characters, a lot of mafia wars, thieves getting themselves in massive underground trouble, and scientists in the hiding unraveling the secrets of immortality, all linked by two shared aspects, torture, and murder.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nThe art style for starters looks very generic and recognizable, similar to those 20s anime series that you used to encounter back in the day on TV, it's not by any means bad or mindblowing, but it's good for what it does.\r\nIt tends to portray the time periods magnificently and seeing how the story takes place in the united states, it really stands out as it puts non-Asian characters in perspective, I mean the characters in design look as American as Uncle Sam.\r\nOne other thing that lights up the mood were the amazing backgrounds, they felt dynamic and that of a depth of place where the characters end up interacting a lot with, you could almost say they were their own characters, as we get to see the story from different perspectives, and as the saying goes, \u201cWalls have ears\u201d, they might as well end up having eyes, and a will of their own (this is anime, so yeah, I'm sane, don't worry about me).\r\nProbably the most outstanding thing about this was the animation, there are those fast-paced action moments where you get to see exchanges of blows, bullets, Swifty parkour and amazing hand to hand combat, those greatness worth of frames do their job perfectly, I would find myself replaying several parts just to get some taste from that eye candy.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nWith such a legendary time period, comes a real challenge of adopting the correct music and soundtracks, and oh boy do they know what they were doing. You can never get enough of that Jazz bass that kicks in in the most badass moments and with a use of sound effects the likes of which put Disney's to shame, you'd almost feel a tingle in your eardrum.\r\nNo, before you come attacking me, I watched the English dubbed version, and good lord was it a fantastic one, this is one of if not the greatest well-made dubbs you'd ever get the pleasure of hearing, it's so good that it makes you feel like it is the way it was meant to be watched, I'm pairing this one with Cowboy Bebop's dubbing right off the bat.\r\nNot only all of the characters have a fitting tone of voices, they nailed the Boston and New York accents of portrayed eras, it was a grand fiesta of quality performance like no other.\n\r\n- Character (10/10):\r\nOh boy, I was dying to talk about the characters. As you might know, there are a lot of series that are story driven, others action driven and so on, but I haven't seen a series that's this heavy character driven, if you would take a look on the character list you would be overwhelmed about how many main characters there are for a series this short, and they all manage to get almost the same screen time, ALMOST. But certainly, no character is neglected or cast away, and every single one of them has a big role in the circulation of the events.\r\nAlong with this wild journey span multiple great characters, and also couples and duos, some of them are just relationship goals, so interesting and likable that they make you beg for a series for each individual of them, I personally found myself attached to every one of them no matter how vicious or arrogant they were.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nNow, I didn't get the type enjoyment I thought I would, expecting to have a historian adventure I was greeted by a guy blasting a kid with a shotgun to the head, in fact, I was doubting finishing the series halfway through, but it was the payoff at the end that made it worthy of that time, the series takes its time to shape up a clear image of what it wants to tell, and only after confusing the heck out of you, it will reveal itself like the artifact it is. Because of how hard it was to keep up with the wide character spread and the fast-paced change of time and space it was very easy to lose attention and interest most of the time, but that was the point, the plot tries to deceive you, throw you off so that you don't pick up the various plot hints through the progression. And in that, it amped up the suspense and made the slightest boring pieces of dialogues intense and noteworthy. Probably what draws me this much to the series now that I've seen it, is how amazingly satisfying it was to see everything come together at the end, all of those loose ends and parts of dialogs and shown events finally made sense.\n\r\n- Overall (9.1/10):\r\nNow, this isn't the kind of shows you would expect a younger audience to grasp, and I understand, for each their intellectual capacities, this is a gory animation, it has a lot of violence, a lot of adult verses and mature topics discussed, so unless you're in the right age and can keep up with confusing plots you might enjoy this, it's really expensive on attention and carefulness, so unless you can 100% focused on the story and not bothered with anything else like thinking about something else while watching or trying to multitask something while seeing it you will enjoy the seat, and just hang in there, if it didn't make sense, it eventually will.\n"

This one was probably one of the best specials a series can have, it gave a lot of information that we were lacking and enforced a lot of plot points, and also, made it a lot harder on us to accept the story's closure.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nThis special gave us more than we could have ever asked for, and no, it was not a definitive conclusion of the story, more like a backing up.\r\nIt tells the story of the formation of the Vanetti family,the meet up of Genzo, Vince, and Raise, some background about Nero and his siblings as kids, their , and everything, while also keeping an eye on some unincluded scenes from the current story's timeline, providing more bromance between Nero and Angelo. It was all beautiful and heartwarming.\n\r\n- Art (8.8/10):\r\nI have to say that this special was somehow better than the parent series in term of animation, I don't know but it felt much more shape and with more quality, the colors where more vibrant as most of the events happened in areas clouded with vegetation in a countryside setting.\n\r\n- Sound (7.2/10):\r\nToo bad there wasn't a DUB version for this one, it would have been far better had it have one. The SUB isn't the worse but the DUB suited this better in my opinion. I'm glad the opening and ending theme songs were kept as amazing as they were.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThis special focused more on the elderly, we had more background about Raise, Genzo, and Vincent, Orco as well, we got to see what kind of men they were, what their relationships were, it made more sense of what they did later on, and even more devastating.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.6/10):\r\nI didn't think I would enjoy 91 Days Special to this degree, this was a damn fine special episode than rose up and gave more meaning to the main franchise.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI would really recommend this pick, mainly of its focus on the characters, giving them extra development and dissecting them for the better. Please only watch this after you finish the parent series for what it holds of potential spoilers.\n"

Ok, with that out of the way, this is an OVA, a short that expands on the original series, be it on the story, or character development, but seeing that the parent story had almost none of those, this is an expansionof its glorious side, that resides on the hardcore fanservice.\n\r\n- Story (4.0/10):\r\nThis OVA, that's told in 2 episodes are a very standalone tails that require no knowledge on the parent show, so even if you have not watched the show, you can probably still watching and enjoy this, it has no attachment to the plot whatsoever, and it's not a bad thing, these two episodes each tell a different story, so the production team must have to improvise a lot, and eventually came with the most stereotypical shounen episodes ever, Nothing to be memorable here really, aside from the yet extreme fanservice.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nJust as good as the main show, with the decent art style, and ideal female anatomy, the ridiculous breast physics are just as wild as ever, and the camera angles, \ud83d\udc4c.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nIf it weren't for the shortness of this animation, the amazing soundtrack would have had some space to breathe, I'm deeply in love with the parent series' OST, too bad it wasn't used more often in here.\r\nThe sound effects used here are surprisingly good, especially the ones simulating sexual contact.\r\nThe voice acting was at it's best as well.\n\r\n- Character (4.0/10):\r\nJust as poor and flawed as the main story, it seems the production team didn't expand on the characters more, as they remain just as one dimensional as ever, most of them are just pure sexual reincarnation that has nothing to admire aside from their body bumps.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI really enjoyed watching this despite its many flaws, it's like they understood what we really want from series such as these, nobody cares about the plot, or else we would have gone to better story driven shows, they just gave us our overdose of fanservice, with extra comedy.\n\r\n- Overall (6.3/10):\r\nThis is originally a sequel to the first season and a prequel to the second, and as one might see them, they are respectively the 13th and 14th episodes from the 1st season, but watching them isn't necessary to grasp the \u201cplot\u201d, if you have time to spare and see some extra goofiness and extreme fanservice, then tag along.\n"

It covers the second half of the first season as well as the first few episodes of the second season, making it a comprehensive way to catch up on the story. The movie is well-animated, with intense action scenes and an engaging storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie does an excellent job of highlighting the key events of the anime, making it an excellent choice for those who want to get a quick refresher on the series.\n\r\nHowever, it's worth noting that the movie condensesa significant amount of content from the TV show into a two-hour time frame. As a result, some of the character development and world-building elements of the show may be lost. Watching the TV show is still the recommended way to experience the full story, but the movie is a great way to get a quick overview of the second half of the first season and the start of the second season. Overall, \"Ajin Part 2: Shoutotsu\" is an good movie that serves as a great recap of the main show. That is sure to impress fans of the anime, but it's best enjoyed after watching the TV series first.\n"

I did enjoy the philosophic talk though, whilst it kept consistent with what was going at that point in the story, it meant something more, but some others were just terrible if taken out of context, like what Ed said about following strangers, probably that's why there were so many cuts from the series huh?\n\r\n- Overall (7.0/10):\r\nI would probably not be that excited to talk about this pick or bring it up on anime related conversations, Many people do not enjoy Cowboy Bebop for the classic it is, many of which are the youngsters, and I can understand where they are coming from, but still, this episode doesn't really add much to the experience as a whole, it's only for those hardcore fans, who would like to see more of the Bebop folks, no matter it was.\n"

No, scratch that, they love it! \"This is how you recap,\" they say. And honestly, we couldn't agree more.

The third one was kind of meh, it had only short wholesome and slow moments so go figure.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nPretty decent I'd say, it was crazy enough to make sense of the humor that was going on and actually worked, unlike more of the times in the parent show.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.2/10):\r\nCompared to the Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood's movie this was high-class tier, a lot of funny moments mainly through bag punching characters and playing the opposite\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nAn actual collection of specials worth their time, I'm double positive that you'll treasure these especially if you're a fan of the parent series.

I've watched a good one hour of this stinky crap so you don't have to, everything I dislike about a show was packed in here like an old tuna tin, especially the core idea. The thing is, Anime can be random, so random, in fact, that anything you can think of has already been animated and made into its own thing. But random doesn't always mean bad, however, Gyo was so random and stupid it might be the worst thing I've ever put interest into. Gore and excessive sexualreferences don't make a bad show better, other more important aspects do, but then again, it neither rains gold nor do fish walk on land... or do they? enter Gyo.\n\r\n- Story (2/10):\r\nIt starts up like any other chich\u00e9 low budget copy-past horror show ever. The university graduates set off for a vacation in other to celebrate their graduation, until, of course, \u201cthe bad guy\u201d triggers the suspense sound effects and have the roll harder than your ears can bear. But this time around, it's not your average serial killer clown or a ghost of any respect, and please quote me on this, \u201cJapan never disappoints\u201d, it's a walking fish! Never have I face-palmed that hard before. A fish peeping on the girls making a stalky expression, and it olay gets weirder that's it's not a fish, no no no, bitconneeee--, sorry, got carried away there. You also get cows, dogs, and all sorts of animals, humans included, on mechanical legs crawling the spider way. They later throw at you some world war II lore in a desperate excuse to make up for the stupid sight of seeing sea creature violating humans on land (of course there is room for your typical octopus tentacle sexual strangling). It's hard to buy that, given the stupidity you get exposed to the entirety of the movie. The only positive thing for me was the pacing, the focus alternates simultaneously between both parties, showing a lot of either side, plus, I can always appreciate a flow that is nimble and efficient on what it presents no matter how bad it is, that's what we call \u201ccalm and classy\u201d.\n\r\n- Art (4.5/10):\r\nI reconsidered my rating on this one a lot. The thing is, among the 2D Anime art style, it was one of the best I've seen. You get reasonable human anatomy for once, people's faces are a lot more like real people's. The gory stuff felt-like gore!! They've put so much work into that, however, the horrible CGI struck hard.\r\nIt was almost some kind of visual torture. Not only the 3D animations are whacky and out of place, but the shading was also just as bad. Having the camera shift around and zoom constantly on the yet horrible 3D models made they low-resolution textures feel a lot painful to look at, I could swear I was able to count the pixels in front of me comfortably.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nSurprisingly enough, my ears haven't complained as much as my eyes did. From what I ranted about, you can tell how clich\u00e9 and stupid my experience was, but as for the audio work, it was in a whole separate dimension parallel to that of the rest of the movie. The sound effects were very classic and dramatic, they made for the perfect seasoning for this abomination. The entire movie was an insult to the excellent voice acting and involving soundtracks.\n\r\n- Character (3/10):\r\nHypothetically speaking (because spiting of this words, I might end up in some mental facility before I know it), if those characters were to exists in real life, they would have a lower survival rate than the average toddler. Not only are they cursed by the fate of continuously tripping down and making bad decisions in the times of panic, but are so stupid that they decided to sleep at the house that they have commented so many times to be smelling of dead bodies, and even seeing a walking fish didn't switch their logical gates once. But then again, that's far from being reality, \u201cwalking fish\u201d am I right?!!\r\nA quick loop over the main characters would print the following; A screaming \u201cI'm a main\u201d (Kaori), your perfect university graduate, with good health and good manners, has a fianc\u00e9 and looks the most successful out of the bunch, too naive to the story she leads. You have an unconfident overweight minority (Aki), she's the type that gets bullied for every bit of air she breaths. And lastly, a horrible friend that f*** every moving body she spots (Erika). Only stating those had me overheat my head from frustration.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (4/10):\r\nA big NOPE for me, I remember seeing clips of the movie back in the day and laughing off how stupid walking fish looked, I never thought I'd ever spend an hour looking at the same clips only getting way more awkward. I can safely say, this hasn't been a pleasant experience for me, the whole walking fish (sharks roaming the cities) was hard to take seriously as it took a lot of immersion from my experience. I would still confess though that I was a bit interested in hearing an explanation behind this nonsense, but was severely disappointed and betrayed to the core.\n\r\n- Overall (4.3/10):\r\nI would never recommend this for people who demand something of true enjoyment, a contest of the worst movies out there? why not. Watching this out of curiosity would be pointless and won't resolve anything, the ending is both oblivious and solves nothing. If you cherish your time and hate to waste it on nothing, please avoid watching this, for watching it come doom and regret. I would be willing to see this with close friends whom I'd rather make fun and criticize this out of the heck of it but as a solid piece of storytelling? It's anything but that.\n"

            "content": "\n                What I like to call, \u201cSernandoe\u201d the Anime (After giving it many thoughts, this Anime really is way above that scumbag's level), it turned out that even  Anime can be very clickbait-y if it really needs to, and you know exactly what kind of clickbait that is, the kind that works 95% of the time, just put some cleavage on the thumbnail and it's guaranteed to get the following of most guys out there, if that doesn't satisfy the needs, inject some arousing words in the title, how about Bunny Girls? Yeah, yeah, that should work... And it did.\r\nWhile not the most creative titleout there, \u201cSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai\u201d, or \u201cRascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\u201d, either way, it still retains a kinky feel to it, has as many similarities with its title as Mario and Wario, they don't culturally get along, but if you really thought about it, they still interact one way or another. And trust me, observations has a lot ot do with the show.\r\nMuch like Sernandoe was talked about as this horrible click baiter that never learned from his past mistakes, so was this show in the eyes of many people. A lot of angry fans of the industry breached in calling it on its supposedly \u201cplagiarism\u201d from the Monogatari series franchise, chill out people, why are you acting like it's the first time a series borrowed an aspect or two from another series, it's how things have always been in this industry, and it worked just fine. Controversy aside, and Bunny Girl senpai resides.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nThis is probably one world you wouldn't be pleasant going to.\r\nRoaring supernatural phenomena that science can't quite explain (aside from this beautiful nerd that got the whole quantum mechanic -inter-som-complex-scientific-term-here in the mix), think of it as if social harassment could physically alter reality, which if you think about it, is an already occurring thing, but not to the same degree of effect as this series goes on about.\r\nThe story is presented from the perspective of very normal people, ones that come from casual families with normal backgrounds, nothing to the extent of bolder blasting superhuman fighters. It primarily follows Sakuta, a dead-face pervy bastard that sums up most of the teenagers in attitude, working his way up to escape this curse called, \u201cAdolescent Syndrome\u201d that affected both him and his sister in the past, and has come back again to his focus as soon as he met this lovely super idol girl from the same high school he attends, lurking in a library while in a Bunny Girl suit (hence the name).\r\nThe story is kind of fast-paced as it covers a lot of side stories on its short 13 episodes length. However, it surprisingly was well directed with a lot of thought that went into it, it never feels so slow or repetitive after a while, although, I would argue that the first half was leagues above what it's become afterward (but still remained high in quality and production).\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nI mean, it's 2018 (2019 as of writing this review), good animation should be the least expected thing in an Anime, and a bad one is jail-able in my opinion, with the technologies we have, even freelance web gen animators are working wonders under their bedroom ceiling and minimal setup.\r\nI really dug the modern and fresh look if everything, the characters and the backgrounds, just one astonishing work of wonder, it makes you beg more shows had the budget and the skill to produce this much consistency in animation and art style.\r\nI've watched enough series to notice how a lot of them fall short on that, I get that having visually consistent pieces of art, a lot of times there would be slight changes in character anatomy even, probably bad camera angles or distorted lighting and shading, but never with Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai.\r\nThe vibrant colors had a strong weight to them it made for the great clumsy fun moment they usually pack into the episode. And what makes me really happy about this show is the minimal to no CGI use, at least not one that made me snip, they managed to hide it so immensely that I was never distracting.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nLet's get the opening and ending theme songs away. How can I put this into word? They were absolutely indefinitely amazing, probably the best in the season? (I guess Goblin Slayer is still there). First, you get the opening theme, this energetic catchy song of glorious Japanese lyrics that I wish I could fully understand, hopefully, one day. And then there is the ending theme that has a strange sad tone to it, it really makes me feel down whenever an episode ends, and as they always leave the juicy stuff at the end of each episode cliffhanger style, the ending theme really highlights that I only want to be left alone at a quiet night at the beat to reflect on myself while listening to it.\r\nVoice acting was yet another nailed aspect of the series, with standouts like Seto Asami, Ishikawa Kaito, Touyama Nao and more, you feel in great and trusty hands. The show packed a lot of strong emotion and it really had to have an outstanding cast of talented voice actors and actresses to get that right, I'm so fortunate to say that it didn't fall short on any of that, it's so astonishing how can a slight syllable of a voice push that tear out, so salty and bitter like a dead nostalgic meme.\r\nThere was a scene I feel had in my opinion the greatest performance in the season, where Sakuta was crying in agony and defeat at one point, it pulled some serious chills in me, I bet the voice actor of him crying the other cast on that recording session to sleep.\n\r\n- Characters (8.5/10):\r\nCharacter design-wise, if I had to vision modern Anime character designs, I would probably have characters of this show line up in my head.\r\nOne thing I'm not really bothered with, but it's almost become a cult to follow from all generic Anime series. The main cast doesn't stand out that much, they do really look like average people, even this supposedly famous social figure, I have to admit that, have I never seen this show, I would probably not be able to tell the main characters of a crown of background figures, but then again, slice of life shows are more about the \u201creal life\u201d that the audience is expected to relate to, even though the whole supernatural stuff it has makes it kind of hard to buy.\r\nOne thing they didn't neglect, which is a crucial rule of thumb of making a successful, is how well written a character is. Again, the audience is supposed to relate to the show, only that says a lot about the \u201clife\u201d part in \u201cslice of life\u201d, a simply throwing irrelevant characters with either way too perfect personalities or strangely out of world treats would be a big no-no and would never work in this genre. We have an extremely realistic collection of characters, each with interesting feats and distinguishable ideology.\r\nTake Sakuta for an example, the lead protagonist fellow under the skin of your casual highschooler, very dirty minded and perverted, which syncs very well with his age demography with a unique dead-face expression and very subtle sense of humor (that comes mostly from him being that much dead in the eye). Both his unironic easy nature of saying whatever is rolling in his mind with no regret, and his good intention of wanting the good for others. And then, there is the queen of waifus in the eyes of many, his girlfriend Mai, the typical older significant other, that looks all that much wiser and more expert at dealing with the grownup world. The same leader of the Bunny Girl cult, it had a great following this season.\r\nThere is also the nerdy Futaba that retains all rights to the waifu chamber as well, the same girl that probably brags privately on how she could subtly explain anything in a formal quantum mumbling. And the list goes two levels or three deeper than that.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI would have gone with a slightly higher score if I could, as Seishun Buta Yaru wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai went from being a scary and obscure long title with a language other than my first tongue's, to something I would spam saying out loud in front of friends and family just to let my inner weeb inform them on what level of weeb-ness I've got to. And it was a fun exercise and a great excuse to burn some verbal calories.\r\nThere is so much that this show did great in my eyes that writing a full list of that now would wear me out of finishing this review.\r\nOne major aspect of that would be the storytelling, especial in the first half, that's for me, the most fleshed out and blood boiling part of the series that does a lot more than simply introducing the characters.\r\nThe supernatural touch had a strong presence in rolling down the action, and honestly, could be the selling point about this series, while they tried to milk as much sense out of it as possible, although it wasn't required to nail the experience, it was still appreciated, I for one, wasn't ready to get lectured on complex quantum mechanics that my poor brain will never grasp, it was a nice way to keep the characters interacting, like energetic young team of dodgeball, you never know who's going to get hit next, it's almost as a roll call, and that was really thrilling about this series, you'd always be \u201cwho's next, oh I can't believe this happened to that...\u201d, stuff like this can make simple sitting in front of a screen watching animated 2D figures be more of an interactive dilemma, even more so as you get in more affection with the characters.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nI feel as if I hadn't expressed how much of a high-quality show this show was, it really takes character writing and story direction as a slice of life show to a new standard compared to other shows of the same release time span. I'm sure it's going to get even more popular (not that it's short on that as of now) and probably become a classic to speak nostalgically about in a few years. And you see, I'm by no means a slice of life fanatic, my area of interest would be shounen if I had to be honest, and still, this was one great well-directed piece of storytelling that will force me to update my all time favorites when it comes to the genre.\r\nAgain, the show isn't really that much hard on mature content, at least, not on the length of going full naked and touchy, there are still a bunch of sexual references that don't make a good job at being sneaky so nobody gets the hang of it, so watching this next to a miner would be something to avoid, especially that the man character is one glorious straightforward bastard.\n"

From the same studio that made the fantastic \u201cSamurai Champloo\u201d, a studio that has recently announced its bankruptcy in the midst of producing \u201cGangsta.\u201d, studio \u201cManglobe\u201d. Anddue to the sudden report, the series gets a lot of hate mainly because of how it ended, but it was never the source material's fault, the stab of bankruptcy was too harsh with the series it left a bad image on most of the fans.\n\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nErgastalum, a fictional town in some unknown country was once home to war and conflicts, people were raised from their childhood days on the principle of killing and assassination under the influence of a drug called Celebrer that gives the user insane strength, speed, and agility. After the war, descendants of those drug users had the symptoms passed down to them and thus were treated as superhuman individuals recruited from the start to be fine killing machines called the Twighlights, for each a specific rank numbered by Tags like (A/0, D/3, C/5...etc). In the current days, the city is being maintained and ruled by four mafia families, called the four fathers that strive to make Ergastalum a heaven for Twighlights to live in. Enter the Handymen, a duo of super skilled dudes taking a neutral stand in all of that mess that rely on making deals with either the police or the mafias to earn their buck of the day. That is until they befriend a mysteriously lost soul, Alex, a desperate young woman who's found in prostitution a way to guarantee her dinner. The trio gets involved in trouble more than they could handle while keeping up a straight smile, and a conflict that shakes the relationship between the four fathers is started.\r\n\u201cGangsta.\u201d was very specific and yet a bit hard to keep up with for how frequent it switched timelines to explain past events, no episode was slow in pace of focused around uninteresting plot points, it was all a blood thrilling action centered fest that didn't fall short of being as sad and emotional when it needed most.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nFor me, studio \u201cManglobe\u201d was always a welcoming trusty guy that's always generous in his giving. I've praised \u201cDeadman Wonderland\u201d before for its excellent fluid animation, and here is Gangsta. setting up a new high ceil of their previous works to the top. I'm not a manga reader, but upon comparing both works, the difference in both the author of the manga and the production team's art style was unnoticeable, so loyal to the source material. What I liked the most was how the general anatomy of people was handled, leaning towards a more Italian feel on the faces, a widely known stereotypical group of people that suit the traditional mafia role.\r\nAll of the fighting scenes, the major and the not so important ones were just a splendid form of moving art that you can never get tired of looking at, I could almost move in sync with the hand to hand combat for how immersed I always felt while watching the series. I appreciate the minimalistic CGI usage, one of the rules of thumb of producing flawless animation in my opinion.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI never give much appreciation to the voice acting in most of the shows I watch, but one simple fact let me have some more consideration of this aspect. Nicolas, one of the main character is a deaf dude that uses sign language to communicate, but also can speak some barely understood words, the voice actor's performance on that part was just so believable, you could feel the struggle he puts into pronouncing every word, it never felt forced or unnatural for a deaf person (talking about the SUB head, but I've heard good things about the DUB as well). This fact alone made me pay extra attention to the other characters as well, and there was a massive distinguishment between everyone's way of talking, there is the guy with the confident tone of voice that's only complimented by his tough beastly force, and there's the hesitation and fear in the troubled character's voice, like there was a special aura in the resonance of the sound of their voice. It fills me with chills just remembering some of the big performances.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nI really appreciate the path they went with here, unlike Baccano! which is an outstanding show by the way, while having as big of a character cast as the latter, it did a slightly better job at keeping up all of the characters in the context of the story. We get to know more about a character than its backstory, which is by the way very sad looking how they were the first generation of the yet still fading off the war. One thing I didn't quite accept was the clich\u00e9 towards linking several characters towards the end, in some cases, I couldn't care less if that was some guy's lost sibling or anything.\r\nYou would think people from the same background would have similar treats, but they weren't similar even by a cellular margin.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nThe has given me a great first impression from episode one, and managed to keep up the quality I anticipated through the series, and for that, I'm most appreciative. At the very least, I added another character to my small collection of favorite-characters-in-anime, and very proud I got to see his greatness on display. I never got any sign of annoyance from any of the characters, the events were going at a considerably semi-fast pace, enough to have me focused on the plot, the animation again was just eye relaxing and kept up the same quality all the way to the end. I never thought I would find something so sad and depressing in a show like that, but I was proven wrong, but in a great way.\n\r\n- Overall (8.9/10):\r\nI would absolutely recommend this for anyone who's looking on a modern, crime, action show, but before diving in, you'll have to be reading for the partial-nudity, sexual references, violence, gore, adult-language as the show doesn't hold back on that a bit. One other thing, due to the bankruptcy studio Manglobe was faced, the show was left in one of the worse cliffhangers out there, so you'll most likely not get you to share of satisfaction from that kind of ending.\n"

            "content": "\n                In the realm of slice-of-life anime, \"Horimiya\" emerges as a delightful surprise that beautifully explores the quirks and complexities of relationships. At first glance, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura, with their seemingly contrasting personalities, striking up a meaningful connection might raise eyebrows. Yet, this series masterfully unravels their stories, revealing layers of depth and relatability that resonate with viewers on a profound level.\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of \"Horimiya\" is its ability to blend humor seamlessly into the narrative. I was genuinely surprised by how funny this series could be. The humor isn't over-the-top or slapstick; instead, it arises organically from thecharacters' interactions and situations. It's the kind of humor that brings a smile to your face, making each episode a joy to watch.\n\r\nWhat sets \"Horimiya\" apart is its sheer chillness. While some anime opt for dramatic twists and convoluted plotlines, this show keeps it refreshingly simple. It's a series that doesn't need high-stakes drama to keep you engaged. Instead, it thrives on the day-to-day experiences of its characters, making even the most mundane moments feel relatable and heartwarming.\n\r\nThe romantic progression in \"Horimiya\" is surprisingly refreshing. It's a love story that takes zero risks, and that's precisely what makes it work so well. The chemistry between Hori and Miyamura is palpable, and their relationship evolves at a pace that feels natural and satisfying. This series accomplishes in two episodes what other shows struggle to achieve in multiple seasons\u2014the establishment of a genuinely endearing and believable couple.\n\r\nWhile Hori and Miyamura take center stage, it's worth noting that \"Horimiya\" excels in its portrayal of supporting characters. These characters are not mere placeholders but individuals with their own quirks and complexities. They add depth to the story, creating a rich tapestry of relationships that enhance the overall viewing experience. \"Horimiya\" understands that a well-rounded ensemble cast can elevate a series, and it certainly delivers on this front.\n\r\nOverall: 7.66\n"

            "content": "\n                [Spoiler Warning]\n\r\nERASED this, ERASED that, the only thing I'm going to erase is my vulnerary of being spammed \u201cWATCH ERASED\u201d by my friends on all caps for what, 2, 3 years now? Well, let me tell you about my flavor of ERASED.\r\nHaving not been on the seasonal fest show back when ERASED was being aired, it is hard to put a definitive finger on what was the talked-about gem and what was just another underlines bootleg attempt of marketing a two-paragraph titled visual novel, but ERASED easily falls under the popular side and having people still praise and bring up the show even 4 yearslater only re-enforce this statement for furthermore.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nA very popular trend in the 2010's Anime was the fresh improvisations that come out from fusing two different genres or aspects of said genres to produce a new church-selling show that quite more than often end up working and causing a buzz in the fandom, such as the deal with ERASED and it's detective thriller and fantasy elements.\r\nFujinuma Satoru, a Manga artist in his late twenties framed for the murder of his mother, gets tangled into a complex paradoxical detective mystery that has him jump timelines back and forth, trying to alter events and play them for the sake of saving his childhood friends and later, his mother.\r\nThe show plays out in a very interesting pace that shows two sides of the same story, from two completely different mentalities that share the same consciousness. The 29 years old Satoru is the same bratty version of himself, although, still attaining the whole 18 years of wisdom and rationality, so you could say, a supernatural kid ruining the plans of a self-praising criminal. That must have been frustrating.\r\nSomething I really liked with the show is how it changes tones and setup almost entirely mid-way of the season, right after the sixth episode, it goes from an elementary school slice of life drama fuel with some elements of phycological terror filled with mystery to a much more complex and mature clear image of what's ERASED is really about. As the first half consists mostly of events from the past, and the second half of what became Satoru in the later years, almost a puberty-level transition between the two sides of Satoru's mind.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nIn terms of the visual fidelity of the show, ERASED pulls no strings, it does what it does decently, nothing eye droppingly crispy as the type of the story it delivers requires no Sakuga but a dim and depressing palette to highlight the hardships it uncovers in the lives of the key characters.\r\nThe character designs, at least, compared to what we get from the Manga are far superior, very appealing and loveable, very expressive and believable.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nAnother thing that goes peer to peer with the assertive visuals is the adaptive voice acting, it emphasizes the visual expressions in a melody of raw Seiyuu talent.\r\nOne thing I religiously listen to even after finishing the show, and not \r\nonly that, but even before I started watching it is the fantastical catchy opening theme song, but I also was so surprised to find how good the ending theme song really is.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nERASED for me was one of those rare shows that features a rich key character cast that doesn't fall into the trap of overwhelmingly focusing on one and ending up neglecting the other characters making them undeveloped and out of the league when a certain moment the required their blossom is calling for action. In ERASED, the protagonist doesn't overwhelm the other lesser important character, quite the contrary they act as both a motivation for him and a development curve that he undergoes. Never have I felt annoyed by a certain character per se, even if there was a slight annoyance or disgust I had towards some of them, it was their role to play to make me feel that way, making them only more devoted and in-character than makes me want to bash, that even includes the big baddy, a certain person that we all suspected from the very start, which was putting off the mystery and decreasing the shock factor that we might have gotten from the end reveal, but it still didn't affect the intensity and progression that really matters. One very interesting theme that's only apparent at the very episodes of the show is the inverse Stokholm syndrome that the victim (Satoru) and the convict have between them. In normal airs, it is the victim that might soften towards the convict, but here we discover that it was the exact opposite, where the convict was the one to lean, embed his very existence to the very annoying worm that was trying to expose him all the way from the very beginning.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nWhen I had hopped into the ERASED bandwagon, I had a strong sense of confidence that I would end up loving the show and that was no over-exaggeration, the hype my friends and the people who recommended the show to me only increased when binging episodes back to back. I really loved and related to a lot of people on the show, I laughed with them, I cheered them up, and I felt their despair all throughout.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nEven before I decided to watch ERASED, I knew it was one of those inviting shows that everyone can watch and enjoy, it sits in middle of the most popular and highly praised mainstream shows and actually stands up even among the popular picks individually, perhaps it's the short length of 12 episodes that has the initial appeal to newcomers, or perhaps it's the fame that precedes its name. No matter what, it is the type of show that you'll find yourself going back to for a rewatch, feeling the characters and reliving the struggles that satisfyingly get overcome at the end.\n"

            "content": "\n                It's obvious that as popular and highly successful One Piece is, it's become a nature to have a new movie or special episode every now and then, some are just amazing, (for once, Episode of Ace, Film Z/Gold/Strong World/Dead End...etc), some are average, in my experience, I haven't seen a terrible one yet, but could this be my first? it feels like I've been gazed by a bullet on this one. So let me rephrase this and make it clear...\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\n\u201cOne Piece: Episode of Nami - Koukaishi no Namida to Nakama no Kizuna\u201d is a retelling of the event of the Arlong Park arc,an arc so legendary with a special aura to it that it's regarded as the gateway into getting into One Piece, but still, the special isn't an excuse to entirely skip that portion of the Anime or Manga and just swallow what you get here. The pacing was very fast, going as far as removing minor to major events to not drag things too much, for instance, Arlong throwing Luffy underwater so that Genzo and Nojiko go for the rescue was like it never happened, but rather was saved by Sanji way before he was thrown underwater in the first place.\r\nI at least give them props on the fighting scenes here, those flashy moves complimented only by the badass quotes they spit as they're hitting the action. Most of the people including myself consider Arlong Park to be one of the most heavily emotional arcs in the series, with such a deep backstory of Nami's and Cocoyashi village in general, in my eyes, this special didn't deliver on that. I rewatch clips from the Anime like all the time that I can't specify an approximate number of the times I've seen snippets from this arc and yet, every time I get my eyes watered up if not cry like a baby, it never got old. This special didn't do it for me as odd as I found it to be, it was all just, meh.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nThe most gorgeous thing about this animation, they did the arc a great deed in this one, especially the fight enhancements.\r\nZoro's fight with Hacchin was definitely better in this new format, and looked even more powerful, the same about Sanji and Koroobi's.\r\nI don't know how to put it, but the animation was so good that it felt like it had a weight on its own, the blows felt stronger, more impactful.\r\nIt certainly felt good seeing a remastered version of Cocoyashi village, it almost looked like a totally new place, in a good way of course.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThe voice acting was good, but not as good as I expected it to be, and that was the down for me when it came to emotional moments. The moment when Nami asked Luffy for help on the original was so well voiced it made this one look like a hoax, for real though.\r\nThey, of course, reused the soundtracks from the parent series, and nothing is there to complain about, in fact, that was just the right thing to do.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nEvery character in One Piece is hands down a unique one with its own motives and background, and from what I've seen and how this special turned out, it was no different. The villagers acted like they matter, Arlong did a great job at sounding like a real jerk again, and the crew members did what they were supposed to.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nNot the best One Piece special out there, I did enjoy the fight scenes and some comedy highlights, but that was about it for me. I am kind of disappointed in this one, expected a better summary to be honest. Maybe it's just me, maybe the Anime did this part just so well it made this one look like a retail potato brick, no hard feelings in this one.\n\r\n- Overall (7.7/10):\r\nFirst of all, this does not excuse you from skipping the Arlong Parl from the Anime series, as that one was miles better in every way, trust me, even the old funky art style has its own charm. I wouldn't think too much about this or put it ahead of schedule or have to put off important stuff to watch it. It wasn't as good as a special can get, but it had something to offer, and no, this is not a must watch either, only for the hardcore fans that don't mind seeing how simple things were back then when they had no bounty or attention around them.\n"

Gangsta. Recap; also called episode 9.5, came with the mindset of acting against those claims and making it a bit easier on the memory to process everything that has happened so far. Just like what \u201c91 Days\u201d did, it was a brief look on the first 9 episodes of the main series to give more clarification on certaincharacters, and explain their connection in a more narrative way.\n\r\n- Story (6.5/10):\r\nTalking here about how the recap handled the retelling of the story, and not on the main strong progression. This honestly felt like a very short episode although sharing the same length with the others, the information presented kept consistent, in a more linear way, they went from introducing every character out there to presenting each faction's motives and hinting at their intentions. In term of the story itself, there wasn't much to praise, I would actually argue this was more of a character centered episode than showing actual events.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nHow I love the art style in this one, it suits the crime genre a whole lot, the gore was just on point, you don't see people splashing fountains of blood when cut or anything. The fight scenes are always very exciting even if they are not major battles. I just love the anatomy and faces expressions. 95% of the animations where clips reused from older episodes, but why I'm going to complain when they looked so good either way.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nThe voice acting was just spot on, Nicolas deprecated voice sounds so realistic and in character, Alex actually sounds like a desperate ex-prostitute with more on her mind than she actually lets out. The ending and opening theme songs that they kept from the main story were above average to very good.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nThe main trio are all likable in their own way, Nicolas, as a deaf ice-cold killing machine that has gone through a lot than my tears can hold for was always a source of sympathy, the lost soul of Alex, as someone who has nowhere to go made it easier for us, the viewers, to understand her sadness. And then there is the guy who ties them all up together, Worick, a guy too kind for their cruel world. In this recap, they went through reminding us of the major plot points consisting those three, and even went ahead and talked about the cop duo, Dr. Theo and his assistance, all of the known four fathers members and leaders, and even the Tabacco shop clerk, the granny and her granddaughter. I feel like they should have gone deeper with the characters and picking on stuff in their past, but looking at the limited length of the episode, I can close an eye on that.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nFor me as someone who didn't binge watch this show, the recap was a vital decision that refreshed a whole lot of information that I either slept off on or forgot. Seeing how we're closing to the end of the series, it would be good to have as much awareness of the story as possible.\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\r\nIf you're already fully concentrated and following the story with a great face, being it a binge watch or not, you won't really miss out much on this recap, but in case you really are lost and confused about all sort of aspects of the show, this one was just a splendid reminder of so many things, like going as far as redefining what a Twilight means, what's the Celebrer drug and so on.\n"

            "content": "\n                Idol series, a genre that certainly has had its peak in the past years but has also known some steep decrease in popularity in recent years. We really don't see a lot of \u201cgood\u201d takes on the genre if hardly any. One could always say it's gotten old or way too repetitive, a bunch of ambitions individuals form up an idol group and strive for fame and success, yeah, I could form the same an assumption if you put it in similar words, but zombies forming an idol group sounds a lot funnier and exciting.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nIt takes a lot to maintain a good and consistentplot, and to be honest, \u201cZombieland Saga\u201d while not of a mature or serious setup and doesn't have a long run to it either is still doing just about decent handling itself in term of consistent writing and story progression.\r\nA bunch of mysterious \u201cidols\u201d from different periods of time gets resurrected somehow into mildly-sane zombies and put in a quest of saving this town called Saga. Don't even ask me how can simply being an idol save anything either.\r\nAs we start at the first episode from a blank starting point, we basically know nothing about their world or the main character cast, but just the idea of seeing everybody open up to one another and strengthening their bonds is one quirk of Zombieland Saga that does right, it's nothing to take lightly as to wake up one day and be told that you're dead and are now a zombie, and seeing these girls not only getting over that, but still have a strong spirit to even dare grow as individuals on a greater scale is astonishing, and the sense of achievement that comes throughout the series is just that inspiring.\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\r\nFor me at least, Zombieland Saga nailed its own art style, I'm confident enough that I could distinguish it from tones of other similar shows, it's just how they play with colors here. So you get theri zombie form that has all of those could and lame colors, and as soon as they put up some makeup to cover that up, you could swear their flesh is now more lively and vibrant, as the colors get stronger and outline them even better.\r\nI feel that it was a shame for a great art style as that to fall short on animation on some of the big moments.\r\nThis is a show about idols, so you know it's going to involve some intense performances on the high scale, and they better have some clean shots in store for that, unfortunately, the use of cheap CG really kills the mood sometimes, you'd be having a great close up on a character's face in mid-performance and then it suddenly becomes a really zombie-fest of a visual with those ps2 graphics. Relying on pure 2D would have saved this show a lot of hassle.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nMusic takes a huge cut from this show, so the vocals better be rocking it alright. And that's where I was right.\r\nUnlike the sometimes horrifying visuals, the featured songs were spot on, you could almost get the same excitement of their live audience as if the voice acting cast were some sort of real world band that know what they are doing. Speaking of which, not only their singing sequences were great but also the rest of voice acting, the sad and fun moments were equally emotionally strong, and probably the star there would be Miyano Mamoru that voices the manager Tatsumi (Also famous for voicing Okabe from Steins;Gate).\r\nI really enjoyed both the opening and ending theme songs, the opening was a bit questionable for me as a first exposure, it had that strange mecha-power-rangers feel to it, but it really does stick to the mind and the ending had a really strong nostalgic feel to it, it almost makes you feel bad the show will have to end one day, and it did for me.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nProbably what this show nails to the bone the most. Every. Single. Character. Man, that's a lot of favorites, I just can't pick one, they are all superb and similarily fleshed out.\r\nFirst of all, their design, they do look like a group of idols for starters, and yes, they have that special main character aura to them as well. I really like their attire, and even reflects the period each one of them belonged.\r\nMy favorite part was their impactful backstories, I thought I signed up for a fun and goofy show, and I ended up pulling on my third tissue box by the end, man, those were some depressing and reflecting backstories that explained a lot of their individual treats, something I never expected from a show like this, but still appreciated to the core.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nI'm not big on moe, nor am I that huge on idols shows, I probably only wanted to watch this because I had some extra free time and I needed to fill, I had already picked up more interesting shows and I needed another one just to make it an even number, but I never expected it to rank even higher than other picks, I really had my fair share of laughs, I spared some tears as well, I even got as far as changing opinions I had on a lot of other things prior to watching Zombieland Saga.\r\nThis is something I'm likely to get back to later, mostly for the fleshed out and lovable characters.\n\r\nOverall (7.8/10):\r\nZombieland Saga proved to be something unlike the generic musical idol series, some would say it's another hit or miss entry, but it really not.\r\nHowever I try to look at it, its emphasis on well-written characters really is something you rarely see in a lot of good shows, and its plot, in general, is something of a great rewatch-ability value, I myself I'm planning to get into the dubbed version as soon as I'm finished writing this review, because apparently, I need more managers screaming of good mornings and shaving squids up my face for no apparent reason.\n"

A huge political and emotional crash that raises the bar on each arc, so much has happened in the three seasons already, and the fourth and the last is just around the corner, any anybody wanted to watch up, there is no better time than now.\n\r\nThis 2 hours long screening recalls the past events, recapping what it can fit inthe time frame from all three seasons which highlights perfectly the tension and the tone change that the series has gone through perfectly.\n\r\nThey could have cramped more into it, but as it stands, definitely the best recap movie in the entire series.

Removing all the meaty mush and exposing you to the highlights of the show, lighting up the part of the story you thought you still remember but have since forgotten about, it almost made it feel like a brand new experience, and in my case, it was far from it.\n\r\nI really like the fact that they actually put in somework into putting together this recap movie, an hour and a half of pure nostalgic gags and tears, I would say that a solid 85% of the movie was composed of reused shots from the two seasons of the franchise, with the rest being new animated scenes between Nagisa and Karma meeting up again at their old school to honor the memory of their late teacher, no our late teacher, Koro-sensei. As they exchanged greetings, they immediately lost track of time as they started retelling what probably was their best and worse year in retrospect.\n\r\nAs a recap, it was, good, I would say that some scenes would have relatively been better if re-adapted, but it was an enjoyable watch empty of grind or boredom of any sort.

            "content": "\n                \u201cConception\u201d, what an interesting word, it sounds very cool saying it out loud, that is, not until somebody who's watched an Anime with the same name hears you and calls you out on your bullshit. Not going to lie, before watching the series, and before reading the synopsis even, all I had was its cheesy cover art screaming of JRPG with nothing appealing to it on the surface, a mediocre poster at best, but why does it have such a dope name I wonder, asked silly past me. Something that's close to this that I'm familiar with was the movie \u201cInception\u201d, I remembered how itblew my mind back in the day and was hoping for something similar, but not until I spot the \u201charem\u201d tag on the genre board. Of course, it's a harem with JRPG setting, could it be just another one of those Isekai we get tons of each season? But then I read the synopsis and everything changed...\n\r\nStory (2/10):\r\nLet's start like every other Isekai, Itsuki, and Mahiru, two cousins get dragged away into this magical looking world in the middle of a serious confession and put into a quest of saving the world. Pretty basic, and I would argue that a lot of readers' minds autocompleted that by something like \u201cthe typical protagonist will have to train harder and become more powerful in order to defeat the big baddy in an intense fight to the death\u201d, No. nothing of that. He actually has to bang 12 maidens and get them to bear his children in order to save the world, sounds unpractical on paper, but believe me, they made it work.\r\nThe story itself has no sense of development and relies more on comedy and erotic interactions (exactly what you'd expect from a harem), there were some cool concepts (Conception? I know it's not funny, I'll stop) like referencing the zodiac signs, it really helped expand the lore a certain bit.\r\nIt took me personally ages to get that I even had to rant over why he named one of his children \u201ccancer\u201d, my mind willingly took the more controversial road on that one.\r\nI don't think there was any serious-worthy moment in the show as occasionally, you can notice the sudden change of tone to a mildly interesting and sad perspective while explaining some of the character's backstories, only for them to discard every effort they put to sell them out and end up ruining not only those characters but entire episodes, something I hated the most about Conception. Add to that the questionable choice of characters that come in all shapes and sizes, makes you question the ethics of watching this Anime, and keep in mind, that he has to bang all of theme.\r\nFrom a sexy nurse to an equally hot secretary, the keep going on a solid preference list until they hit the no-go-land by introducing some as underaged girls that probably have no idea what's their role going to be in the show. And let's add to that the incest figure that it Itsuki's cousin, they're really going all out here, or did I forget the gay-ish paring as well, where he has to temporarily check out some guys to hook with for some reason? and let's not forget the part where he screws a raccoon for all of those furry fans' sake, screw this show.\n\r\nArt (6/10):\r\nSpeaking of the animation, as in, the animated frames, quality of movements and everything that takes part in producing \u201csolid\u201d movements. I wouldn't call this a strong point of Conception, it really looks like the product of not a very high budget but still holds enough to get you staring at the screen.\r\nWhat I really appreciate, however, are the character designs, so we have those two individuals who arrived from a world that's supposed to be the real world we're living at. They look pretty much painfully averagely looking people, they don't stand out too much from the crowd nor do they have your typical main character visual treats, I bet you'd mistake them being mains from other characters in the background, that's how averagely looking they are. But what Conception did great was the designs of these maidens from the new magical world, they do autocomplete their origins and on their own have some of the greatest character designs I've seen this season, however, that's not speaking of them all but still the majority of them.\n\r\nSound (7/10):\r\nAt least they went easy on your ears. Some of the cast (not all) have great voice actors behind them looking at how mildly big the cast is, you're bound to found some of your favorites here, I know I was pleased with Reone's voice actress (Yamaguchi Yuriko, the same actress behind Robin from One Piece).\r\nI really enjoyed both the opening and theme songs, speaking a whole lot about the opening, but not so much for the soundtrack, if they were there in the first place, it seems I've spent a lot of my watch time facepalming than focusing of the plot of the series.\n\r\nCharacters (4/10):\r\nIt really is a shame for great character designs to fall under such blunt characters, characters that don't bring anything new to the table rather than being there to look cute and make for waifu material, and without a doubt, some of them do make for great waifus, but no amount of waifu-ism can save an adaptation this bad.\r\nItsuki a character that's hardly relatable, even though one of the selling points of most of the harem shows is making the protagonist relatable to most of the audience in a way, I probably got his name just because I'm writing this review only minutes later after watching the last episode of the show, that should be forgotten by the end of the day no doubt. There was this character I liked with yellow hair, he had great design and cheerful karma around him, so disappointed he was put to the side.\r\nAside from great characters, there was an individual who unbelievably reeks of annoyance, a cursed talking raccoon that more perverted than him my eyes have never seen who doesn't shut up on explaining obvious jokes and spams sexual references like a Vietnam machinegun, it really starts out very annoying and ends out even more annoying. Like man, screw Mana to death.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nThere it is, and I'm not ashamed of it, it seems as trashy this Anime is, and I'm fully aware of how truly bad it is, I just couldn't seem to act like I never enjoyed it, horrible storytelling aside, I really feel like the show itself was pretty self-aware of how bad it sucked, it even kept throwing fourth-wall breaking jokes in the aim of roasting itself, for me, it was more of a semi-cringy comedy serialization with harem elements to it, having \u201csex\u201d as its only selling point, a lot of people hate it just for that and never bother giving it a chance.\r\nI do believe it's got the most stupid and awful ending ever, I've never seen such a horrible way to end a series before, but it remains as a decent comedy stand up, if only they focused more on that and ignored the shallow plot they set up at first.\n\r\nOverall (5.4/10):\r\nWithout a doubt, not my proudest watch, but also not my worst. I'm confident enough that I'll be rewatching this abomination, not for the plot this time, but more for the giggles in the future, yes it's trash, but if only people gave it a chance as a not so serious comedy series and spared all the fuss about the plot's inconsistency they would genuinely get some fun time, it's filled with fanservice of course, to the point you'd think this was way better off released on a site like HentaiHeaven or something, Highschool DxD has set off a record to what defines an Icchi and what's straight out Hentai, and Conception was near that fine line.\n"

            "content": "\n                You know a series is making it big when you hear about movie releases, it's not easy to get a display on the big screen. The next step is looking at several movies that relate to said series and the first one usually gives off nostalgic vibes, even for the newer audience. Sadly, in Bleach's case, that couldn't be further than the truth.\n\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nAs much as I hate to say it, this felt like a nicely animated filler arc that lacks an interesting plot, characters, and villains.\r\nThis self-contained story introduces an interesting concept that deals with memories in the world of Bleach, and pretty muchanything else felt like an excuse to justify saying; \u201chey, this thing exists, it can totally happen, and here's how it goes\u201d that could have been easily a line that Urahara drops at some point.\r\nThe entire thing plays like your typical Bleach filler arc, some forgettable character named Senna stumbles across Ichigo and gang claiming to be a soul reaper until the tides loosen and the villain group interested in capturing her appear and force her to seek Ichigo's help.\r\nThe villain himself couldn't have been less interesting even if they tried so. Pulls up the clich\u00e9 trope where he stabs Ichigo in his Bankai effortlessly form only for Ichigo to somehow defeat him on their second encounter.\n\r\nThe ending was kind of bittersweet, basically, a puppy-beater plot. Here's a cute and helpless pup, we're gonna kick him around, now start crying.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI guess aside from something else that I'll talk about later, this was the only thing that carries the movie.\r\nIt simply looking nice and alive. I swear Bleach's animation and art somehow always emit a unique aura that can't be felt anywhere else.\r\nThe borderlines are crisp, the colors contrast each other nicely and the animation is fluid enough to make the dull fights epic enough.\n\r\nSound (8.8/10):\r\nFinally, the real star of the show, the OST.\r\nNo one can deny that Bleach bundles and always has. There are a lot of very iconic and fire soundtracks that put most others to shame.\r\nThe sound effects are also very good and crisp, more believable than most shounen shows too. The voice acting is spot on, both the Sub and the Dub were great, I found myself alternating between the two the entire run of the movie.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nRating the same cast of character that we see each episode of the TV series would be kinda unfair, so I'm gonna focus on the new faces instead. Senna, I guess I've stressed enough how dull and uncompelling she was. Her role as a main character in this movie gives her more opportunity to shine and show off, but she, instead, ended off acting more like a hostage that drives the plot forward than a contributor to cleansing the evil.\r\nThe villain group was just another failed attempt of an evil organization, all fodder with nothing more to them, and their head can't decide when to be a snowflake or an Aizen level threat for once and for all.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nTo me, Movies are another escape from the show, in the show to enjoy the same show. Does that make any sense? If I'm watching 900 episodes of One Piece, at times I would want to break away from Luffy's constant screaming at the same villain for multiple episodes and rather watch a movie that diverts from the every-day quest and explores other adventures of the crew. This was not my experience with this movie.\r\nIt felt like escaping the epic canon to watch an average condensed filler arc, it did have its moments, yes, but by no means did I feel like visiting it anytime soon. It was okay.\n\r\nOverall (7.26/10):\r\nAs big of a fan as I like to imagine myself, that was hella underwhelming. I dove in with full-on excitement and big expectations, but I ended up discarding all of that in the first 20 minutes of the movie because I know I recognize that tone and pacing, I've been through any filler arcs across multiple series and that feeling was not strange to me.\r\nIt's very hard to recommend something like this related to a series you like, especially to newcomers, fearing that they might get the wrong idea about the show, because Bleach can be so much better, so much more, and Memories of Nobody was so far away from being any of that.\n"

My Hero will always be a good show, but the desperate hateful eyes will never shut up about comparing it to this and that.\n\r\nI believe the franchise needs no introduction, with 5 seasons (6ths in the works) and three movies to its name as of writing this review, its fame haswell been planted and solidified, a popular show like this can't be bad, right? right? With that aside, we're here for the movie, not the label at hand, so buckle up for the read.\n\r\nIt was a surprise to nobody that a show of this magnitude received a movie in early 2019, but as the majority agrees, it left a lot of being desired. Some months later, in the same year, the second movie was released, so no doubt of the latter's success, and Oh boy did they learn from their past mistakes.\n\r\nI felt like this movie had everything the previous one lacked, rivalry fan service. This felt more like the second Naruto Shippuden movie (Bonds) that was focused on both Sasuke and Naruto, where this one, respectively, Bakugo and Midoriya were the highlights. Let's forgive the fact that this was a filler movie, so nothing that happened should be bound by cannon constraints, and I'm talking specifically about the ending portion of the movie which I will not spoil for anyone.\r\nMore than any other episode, this movie felt like an appreciation letter for the Deku/Bakugo rivalry fans, it does so well by that premise leaving you wanting Bakugo to really get there in his relationship with Deku in the canon material.\r\nAnother great display of characters was the villain group, albeit, I do not agree with the popular take that goes it was better than the league of villains, the villain group at hand did what it was set up to do, it presented a hopeless challenge to class 1-A, it raised the stakes too high degrees of desperation and despair, and most of all led to the cooperation of Bakugo vs Deku and the jaw-dropping final showdown.\n\r\nSpeaking of jaw-dropping, the animation was really going that hard, every fight scene was handled with care and delicacy no matter how insignificant it was, fluid cartography, weighing impacts, and organic movements. Also, I couldn't help but notice the extra vibrancy that dwelled in the color pallet, this movie felt and looked colorful.\r\nAs always, MHA knows its musical sheets, every intense moment was met with an even more intense musical score and I'm talking specifically about the final showdown, it was a really interesting choice on their part.\n\r\nI'm not the biggest My Hero fan, to no extent, really, but this movie hit me differently, I tend to fall asleep late at night while I'm watching... anything, but not this time.\n"

            "content": "\n                I am no connoisseur, but having watched so many battle Shounen shows, it just grows a sixth sense in you that teaches you to act accordingly towards a show, whether to increase your hype level, or whether to label it as just another mediocre attempt at milking out a genre that has long been dead beaten.\n\r\nBoku no Hero, or the new bearer of the Shounen torch as some people in the fandom call it was always there for me, not in \u201can emotional support\u201d or something, but the terms of being that quality show I would rank up with the best of the best, thatis, until some questionable direction from the latter half of the third season. There I just couldn't regard as such. It pulled one of the most boring and badly paced arks in featured that I really started to believe that the show, with its almost yearly release, is getting me kind of burnt up. Every season we see a slightly varying flavor of the same thing, over and over again, that the progression of the character felt suck in a time capsule, only convenient for monetization purposes. This show must have a convincing redemption, and fast, or else, I might just end up disliking it. That is, all and more, was the fourth season. Yes, my initial reaction was \u201cUghh, another season of the same bullcracklles?, fiiiine\u201d, and by the end of the season, it was actually \u201cplease, give us more. Season 5 hype\u201d.\n\r\nStory (8.3/10):\r\nFrom a surface level, the fourth season is a direct linear sequel to the 3rd, with no time jumps in between whatsoever, which makes it the more convenient for people who are binging seasons back to back, with an almost seamless transition.\r\nThe pacing in this season I would say was slicker if not on par with the prequels, a lot happens during each episode and the progression of events keeps escalating until the climax you know you're going to love happens.\r\nSo many great moments in this one, and only after you think the season has given all you were expecting, came the last arc spanning the last two episodes with a comeback bigger than anything we've seen before, I would arguably was at the same level of aww as the One For All vs. All For One fight.\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nIt seems like Boku no Hero Academia has set up a score for itself and keeps breaking it and pushing forward with every season. That is what a battle seasonal Shounen should be. Sakuga that ascends from heaven, Sakuga that makes you go on rampant rewatches on Youtube, Sakuga that makes you memories and take interest in the animators behind.\r\nAt the core of it, the fights might just be hero vs. villain, but the cake topping it got truly puts it above many other fights.\r\nYet again, excelling at what t does best, impact frames, you just can feel the punches, you almost react on a physical way when you see how crazy something happens, and how fabulous the color palettes changes unprecedently.\n\r\nSound (8.6/10):\r\nMaybe it was just me, but My Hero Acamedia always had such a bombastic OST that works whatever the circumstance. You're at a gym and need something to get you pumped up? There is an OST for that. You want something slice-of-life-y to chill and relax too? There is plenty of that, or what!? something heavy n emotion now? We've got just the right track for you. It is a wide and varying collection of greatly put together vocals that just keep you wanting.\n\r\nThe voice acting too is worth praising. Every season has it's the high moment, and all of them come nicely together when you put the narrative, the visuals, and the audio together. It might sound like a great silent movie without it, but man does the vocal credibility of the show shine and make a noticeable presence.\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are another side of what makes a show memorable, what makes it brought up into conversation too often and what makes up the majority of its Youtube surfing. Although not the best the series has had, but definitely right there among the best of the season.\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\r\nThis season might have as well been the best My Hero Academia has ever been presenting its characters. Where do I even start? Big highlights for Lemillion, and even greater highlights for Endeavor. And don't even, get me started on Hawk. Dude's first appearance in the show and he manages to become one of the best heroes.\r\nWhat really sells this season for me the most is how \u201creliant\u201d it was on not-so protagonists, it gave a lot of exposure to lesser featured characters and that somehow turned out to be a better screening that some of the biggest key characters make up for. I mean, just look at Gentle and La Brava. Two characters appeared out of nowhere end up connecting with so many viewers, spaning a relatable perspective.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI'm still debating with myself even as I write this review, but this season might be my favorite in the franchises. It was what awakened my love for the series, which made me appreciate its overlooked aspects more and what made up most of the fun I had watching a feature show this season.\n\r\nOverall (8.68/10):\r\nThe fourth season felt to me like an eye-opener for the burnt-out fan of the series. It revisits the same aspects and ideas of its prequels, but pusher its limit to another length, expressing more on emotions, this time on the lesser featured characters, it's not always Deku and the boys, but even some of the minimal faces, new and old get massive exposure and characteristic.\n"

            "content": "\n                Vivy: Fluorite Eye\u2019s Song - To Make Everyone Happy With My Singing is a recap of the 13-episode anime series that follows the journey of Vivy, the first autonomous AI, who is tasked with preventing a war between humans and AI in the future. The recap summarizes the main events and themes of each arc, from Vivy\u2019s debut as a singer at NiaLand to her final confrontation with Archive, the collective intelligence of all AI.\n\r\nThe recap is a decent way to refresh your memory of the series, but it does not offer anything new or exciting. It is essentially a compilation of clips from theoriginal episodes, with some narration and transitions added. The recap does not explore any deeper aspects of the characters, the world, or the plot, nor does it provide any insights or commentary on the themes of AI ethics, identity, and free will. The recap also glosses over some of the inconsistencies and paradoxes that arise from the time travel premise, which may bother some viewers who are looking for a more coherent and logical story.\n\r\nThe recap is not a bad watch, but it is not a very memorable one either. It is a serviceable summary of a series that has much more to offer than just a recap. The original series is a stunning showcase of Wit Studio\u2019s animation prowess, with fluid and dynamic action scenes, expressive and detailed character designs, and breathtaking backgrounds and settings. The original series also has a captivating soundtrack composed by Satoru Kousaki, who also worked on Monogatari and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The songs performed by Vivy and other AI singers are catchy and emotional, and they reflect the characters\u2019 personalities and growth throughout the series.\n\r\nThe recap is a good option for those who want to revisit the series without rewatching all 13 episodes, or for those who want to get a quick overview of the series before watching the sequel or spin-off (if there will be any). However, for those who want to experience the full brilliance and beauty of Vivy: Fluorite Eye\u2019s Song, I would recommend watching the original series instead. The recap is an ordinary recap of an extraordinary series.\n\r\nOverall: 6/10.\n"

Occasionally, within this rich tapestry, a recap episode emerges, designed to revisit key moments and allow viewers to reacquaint themselves with pivotal events. While recap episodes can sometimes be perceived as a means of taking a breather from the main storyline, \"Bleach: Shuku! Rukia Dakkan! Kagayaku! Shinigami Juuban Shoubu! Mitai Shinigami Doon to Misemasu Special\" presents a nostalgic journey through the Soul Society arc that feels more like a trip down memory lane rather than a mere rehashing of events.\n\r\nRecap episodesoften walk a fine line between providing valuable insights for new viewers and offering something substantial for longtime fans. This special episode of \"Bleach\" admirably strikes this balance, presenting the core narrative from the captivating Shinigami Agent and Soul Society arcs. What makes this recap stand out is its ability to engage the audience through a clever blend of storytelling and character interaction.\n\r\nThe presence of characters like Kon, Hitsugaya, and Ichigo breaking the fourth wall adds an element of fun and charm to the recap. They effectively act as the audience's guides, reminiscing about the most memorable and impactful moments of the series. Their banter, mixed with genuine admiration for the journey they've undertaken, creates a bridge between the viewers and the anime's core narrative.\n\r\nDespite being a recap, \"Bleach: Shuku! Rukia Dakkan! Kagayaku! Shinigami Juuban Shoubu! Mitai Shinigami Doon to Misemasu Special\" transcends the label of \"lazy\" by presenting the selected events in a fresh and engaging manner. The recap episodes offer a well-paced compilation of action sequences, character interactions, and pivotal plot points that embody the essence of the Soul Society arc. While the main objective is to revisit these moments, the special breathes new life into them through skillful editing and narrative framing.\n\r\nThe inclusion of this recap episode within the context of the original series and its release alongside episode 63 and the DVD of the Soul Society: The Rescue arc speaks to the creators' awareness of the audience's journey. It acknowledges that viewers have invested time and emotions into the series and aims to celebrate that investment by offering a sentimental reminder of the path traversed.\n"

It's like that time in your life when you're a clueless student, wandering aimlessly through the halls of indecision, unsure of what lies ahead. You know, that sweet spot between ambition and utter confusion. Well, Hell's Paradise manages to encapsulate that perfectly.\n\r\nIt's a show that's so inoffensive, you'd think it was trying to win an award for neutrality. It's like it couldn't make up its mind on what it wanted to be. Is it an action-packed adventure? A philosophical exploration? A romance blossoming in the midst of chaos? Who knows? Eventhe show itself seems to be scratching its head, wondering where it fits in the grand tapestry of anime genres.\n\r\nBut hey, at least it's consistent in its inconsistency. You never know what to expect from one episode to the next. Will it be thrilling? Will it be mind-numbingly dull? Will it leave you questioning the very fabric of your existence? Well, one thing's for sure, it won't leave you indifferent. You'll be left with the eternal question: \"What did I just watch?\"\n\r\nAh, let's talk about the animation in Hell's Paradise. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, my friends. One moment, you're treated to stunning visuals with triple A-level particles and strokes that make your eyes pop out of their sockets. You can practically feel the effort and attention to detail oozing from the screen. It's like a feast for the eyes, a visual extravaganza that leaves you in awe.\n\r\nBut then, just as you're settling into the blissful embrace of high-quality animation, the show throws you a curveball. Suddenly, you're faced with moments that make you question if your toaster is running the latest Minecraft shaders. The movements become lazier than a sloth on a hot summer day, and the FPS (F given Per Second) drops faster than your hopes of winning the lottery. It's like someone accidentally spilled a bucket of mediocrity over the animation team.\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the voice acting. In a sea of inconsistency, the voice actors manage to hold their ground and deliver some solid performances. They bring life to the characters and inject emotion into their lines, even when the animation quality decides to take a nosedive. It's like a shining beacon amidst the chaos, reminding you that there's still hope in this tumultuous journey.\n\r\nBut let's not forget the true gems of Hell's Paradise: the Opening and the Ending. They are, without a doubt, the shining stars of the show. The Opening of the year, a visual and auditory masterpiece that hooks you from the first note and leaves you craving for more. And the Ending of the year, a melodic treat that wraps up each episode with a touch of elegance and melancholy. They are the true highlights of this wild and unpredictable ride.\n\r\nSo, if you're in the mood for a show that's as indecisive as a teenager trying to pick their prom outfit, Hell's Paradise might just be the perfect match for you. It's a journey of self-discovery, where even the show itself is searching for its true identity. Strap yourself in for a wild ride of confusion, mediocrity, and the occasional moment of \"Huh, that was actually pretty decent.\u201d\n"

Much like most One Piece fans, I was hyped to the max for this movie, as most of us call it, \u201cShanks's move\u201d. It was something it felt like 2 decades coming, but never too late, we finally get to know more about this fan-favorite character, until we didn't... Well, kinda.\n\r\nNo spoilers in check, the info we deluded ourselves wewere gonna get was nowhere in sight, II don't get why they decided to include it in the booklet given for free for people who watched the movie in Japan, the movie had a lot of screentime to cram the info in, heck, the Manga could have taken a couple of chapters to the whole thing. We took the hit on this one.\n\r\nReality has it, this was a mediocre One Piece movie with a few hype moments, and a fantastic musical fiasco that did not slow down on creativity. The key here is to know what to expect, II have never heard about Ado before this movie, and I assure you it will not be the case after it, I mean, for someone with the same name as Oda sensei, only in reverse (Oda => Ado), destiny did quite a play on us. I loved every single song featured in the movie, and the visual choreography was no idle either, really, a masterful presentation for what felt like a lifetime music festival that just happened to be taking place in the world of One Piece.\n\r\nThe animation felt right at home, nothing too crazy, thanks to Toei's amazing work lately on the anime, the movie mentions the same Wano arc with all the swirly washed-up strokes, and of course, some average CGI blending that could have been omitted in my opinion.\n\r\nThe plot itself was nothing spectacular, again, much like Stampede, the whole setup felt like a fan service showcase that revolves around the Red-Haired Pirates.\n\r\nOverall: 8.32\n"

Back as in just another season, or back as in making a comeback of earning its merit back.\n\r\nAlicization was the game-changer.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nAfter seeing all of the previous installments, both season, the OS movie and all of theother shorts, I felt like I had already seen everything there is, SAO as a concept was good, while it lasted, what else could it bring to to the table, we've seen VR exploits, AR exploits, real-life convoluted drama, we've seen everything, or at least, that's what seemed to us, and then Alicization came.\r\nThe very fact that the name Alicization itself explains more about the season than I could ever do is amazing. Presenting a new spin on virtual worlds, or is it really? If dreams count as virtual, maybe, that is exactly the kind of convoluted questions the series pushes you into, and also, an underrated portion of it.\n\r\nThe plot kicks off in a very confusing setup, that slowly, but surely clears up the fog surrounding it in a very satisfying and comprehensive way, it tackles an interesting spin on memory manipulation, both clever and very uncommon in mainstream media, hitting off the same wave of high risks as the first season, with big challenges for the characters to overcome.\n\r\nThe story progression was surprisingly very fast-paced and action-heavy, a lot of info-dump episodes in between and a whole lot of friendship bonding. More than SAO or ALO, Project Alicization, even though not intended as a game, felt closer to being a perfect RPJ than anything previously introduced, the grind is very rewarding and contributes to the story, the lore and the surrounding world was massive and very welcoming, it keeps you wonder and ask questions, but never leaving you with no answers.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nA strange and yet welcomed change on the visual level has been the talk of many fans, for the better or the worse, I would say, it definitely takes after Highschool DxD hero with its dry, flat colors that seem to have a personality of their own, very vibrant and eye-catching.\n\r\nThe movements have definitely gotten an upgrade, SAO has never been so fluid, I don't think that even the movie OS compares to some of the stuff we get to see, truly a passion project.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nThere again, I was absolutely home when it came to the vocals. I would say, next to Black Clover, SAO has never disappointed in that regard.\r\nIf it's the openings you ask, endings maybe, OSTs, get your ears ready for the treat, absolutely a masterful bundle of ear-tingly runs, some big names were involved in this production, and it definitely shows.\n\r\nThe voice acting was great, probably better than anything we've seen from the series. Kayano, Ai, truly a highlight in this regard, she does Alice in such a perfect and faithful way, probably the best voice-to-character match in the series, and you gotta love Eugeo's big moments as well, as the cry baby he was for the longest time, his voice complemented that just good enough to high the spot. It was believable.\n\r\nFinally, this is probably the first time I praise this series about this specific, overlooked aspect, the sound effects. Last time I really fell heels over an Anime's SFX was with Fire Force, although the later is still superior in that regard, damn Alicization, you definitely came close.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nI never thought this series can grab my interest over the characters after seeing everything prior to Alicizeation, it looks like bringing along a full-on new cast of character was just the way to go.\r\nKirito, yet again, proves to be as adaptive as he was ever introduced as he bent very quickly and masterfully, I would say, even better than he ever did with the new faces of this season, and honestly, he hit his peak so far, and I can only wish for similar feats from him on the future.\n\r\nEugeo was just the companion to highlight Kirito's growth. 3 seasons into the franchise, it's normal to expect from the main character to have to grow some mass, on a character level of course. Thanks to Eugeo, Kirito definitely takes on more of a mentor/senpai role, he gets to share a great deal of wisdom and teach his friend(s) about all sorts of things.\r\nWhile accompanying Kirito, Eugeo too overcomes a lot of what held him back, going from a cry baby to an absolute beast in combat, from a naive clueless cowardly cat to a strong Aincrad-style representative.\n\r\nAlice as well, as suddenly introduced as Eugeo was, she definitely secured a high place in the black swords man's harem, making people even swear over her than Asuna. I can't blame them.\r\nAs little of screentime she had compared to Kirito and Eugeo, she definitely had a greater attachment to the grander plot, both as a goal to the other duo protagonists and a drive of the franchise from this point onwards.\n\r\nAnd last but not least, let's not forget the real MVPs of the season, Cardinal-chan of course, but most importantly, Charlotte the spider. There was a reason after all, why the SAO wiki changed their cursor to the cute spider.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nFunny enough, I never heard any words of praise over the third season before, or at least, not as much as I should have seen how good this season holds up. Maybe people just didn't want to say anything positive about the series. I'm hesitating probably, but this might as well be the best experience and the most fun I've had watching SAO, that or ti's going toe to toe with the Aincrad arc from season one.\n\r\nThe mystery and hype, the vibes, everything about what made Aincrad loved nad praised is definitely present in Alicization, I would say, ever more if we include the amazing spin on the whole Fluctlight manipulation which gives the series a great deal of lore that ups a lot of points in that regard.\n\r\n- Overall (9/10):\r\nAfter the abomination that was season two, well, I didn't use to call it that, as it was a decently compromised season, but after seeing Alicization, the poor thing got sandwiched between Aincrad and Alicization, faith was not kind at all to GGO.\n\r\nThis is a great season, no, an amazing one, definitely lived up and even surpassed the \u201cSAO will return\u201d phrase that I thought for the longest time was just another marketing ploy to get people interested in the release. I would easily encourage people to start SAO just so they can see Alicization in that regard. Truly a comeback to the franchise, setting new heights that I'm optimistic it will keep on delivering on. Hopefully.\n"

It seemed like you're typical harem ecchi-heavy show until you realize how massive of a following it had.\r\n\u201cNande Koko ni Sensei ga?\u201d is relatively short series that politely asked you to leave every shred of logic you'd expect and just enjoy the ride for what it is. It did not take itself too seriously, it did not bring anything new to the table either.\n\r\n- Story (5.5/10):\r\nFour teenage male students and four female teachers, one having a crush on another meet a ba- ugh, at a school, theymeet at a school. A couple of breaks later, an Anime is born.\r\nWhile not very problematic, I would drop it right off the bat and say that the show is at the very core lacks every sense of depth from what comes of a thought striking story.\r\nIt composed of a brief crossover of four related stories with interchangeable characters playing a game of odds, and it just happens to have all of them going for the protagonists. They might say love is a battlefield or some clich\u00e9 crap, but this show makes you question your life choices and making you start wondering, \u201cDid I go to the wrong school?\u201d.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nAs average as the topic it tackles, it was nothing special, very generic but just about enough to keep you watching. You better not expect any high budget over 60 fps fluid eye candy, that is, if your definition of eye-candy is something entirely different which I totally agree with, then you'll probably end up disappointed, however, to the meaty kind of eye candy I was alluding to, you bet you're going get your fill. Beautifully illustrated erotic shots make up at least 60% of the episode, which is always the selling point for this kind of shows, a welcomed feat by the way.\n\r\n- Sound (7.3/10):\r\n  As long as my eyes enjoyed the view, my ears didn't really get anything of nearly similar quality. Very basic voice acting at best, but when you come to playing roles that involve in dialogue with more moans than words, then you've got a great excuse.\r\nOn the other hand, the opening and ending songs were just amazing, I'm expecting those to appear on the next popular Anime song quiz on Youtube.\n\r\n- Character (6/10):\r\nI'm going to have to be fair in here, that's not the greatest cast of characters I've seen, and not nearly the worst either.\r\nAll pairings were very unique with respect to each other. But not nearly enough depth to them to make them that memorable, I haven't been able to memorize any names from the show, ending up forgetting about them just after I read them on every subtitle. In respect to their designs, very average which only falls on the Art department too.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI just love the concept. Starting off every episode with repeating the same words that make the title of the series \u201cNande Koko ni Sensei ga?\u201d made for hilarious moments, even though they always seemed heavily predictable. The ships were all great except for the dangerously pedophilic one (The athletic teacher and the petite boy).\n\r\n- Overall (6.68/10):\r\nI'm quite surprised with how low it scores on paper, I was preparing to drop a rating around 7 and 7.5, however, I can't recommend it highly enough if you're in for some short ecchi comedy heavy show that really pushes it as far as it can and not nitpick about every detail.\n"

This special edition was created as a way to commemorate the release of the first volume of the popular TV anime \"Overlord\" on BD & DVD. The creators behind this special edition did an excellent job of blending the cute and quirky art style of the original \"Pure Ple Pleiades\" with the darker and moremature themes found in \"Overlord\". This combination of vastly different elements was a bold move, but it worked beautifully.\n\r\nThe art style in this special edition is simply adorable. The character designs are classic chibi-style and the bright and cheerful color palette used throughout the show gives it a playful and light-hearted feel. The backgrounds are beautifully detailed and provide the perfect setting for the whimsical adventures of the characters. The visual effects are also top-notch, adding an extra layer of excitement to the already entertaining story.\n\r\nI say, more shows should take notes from this and improve their marketing strategies.\n"

            "content": "\n                Written by the same author of \u201cSuzuka\u201d and sharing the same worldline and characters, \u201cFuuka\u201d is a music-centered shitfest of forced and rushed up drama having character's emotionally abused as often as one's blinking. Not forgetting the incest references, of course, showing several naked scenes than necessary, so keep up your family distance on this one. A show that's been accused of having the wrong protagonist, and honestly, childhood friends have had enough of this, and Fuuka doesn't go easy a bit. But that doesn't exclude people from claiming it to be one of their favorites, going as far as paring it with the fantastic\u201cClannad\u201d, that's where I draw a thick line folks, and I'm about to clear the reason about that in this review.\n\r\n- Story (5/10):\r\nAkitsuki Fuuka (wow how original of the show's title), a clumsy go-lucky highschool girl (the daughter of Akitsuki Yamato and Asahina Suzuka, the protagonists of the indirect prequel of this show, \u201cSuzuka\u201d) is at a very relatable stage of her life, that one hard-to-knock-off-wall that goes about having students decide what they are going to do next. In the other side, you have your typical silent unsocial male protagonist, Haruna Yuu, that has an extreme obsession about sharing every bit of detail about his life on Twitter. The two happen to meet each other, and right from the first episode already manage to get as close as one can call a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And with that, the flaws of the show start to mercilessly attack every sense of logic remaining. I still can't grasp how could an individual (Yuu, the protagonist) join a band with no talent or prior knowledge to music, only being there because some random girl he met told him to. The show at first gives a really focused view on Yuu and Fuuka, I've seen this strategy before, making the viewers ship the heck out of them until we get mercilessly stabbed at the heart by the introduction of this childhood friend that apparently has always had a crush on Yuu. Meet Hinashi Koyuki, both a member of this little love triangle and overall a very famous idol that the other side of the triangle (Fuuka) is a big fan of. \u201cThat is some seriously interesting setup\u201d, said old naive me that had more expectations on this show than it actually delivered upon. Right after she's introduced she goes through causing misfortune between the two only for her to get hurt by the end of the story and the two obvious pair get back along again. Now try to picture that turn of events, but in the most terrible way you can, that's what Fuuka, and extremely below average show in terms of love stories is. And that's excluding the other side characters, like this one girl, Iwami Sara, a girl that showed hostile behavior towards the protagonist at first to only make a complete 180\u00b0 split in personality for no apparent reason going as far as threatening their modest love triangle to becoming a square. I feel that the show could have been better if they focused more about the actual band's growth and them realizing their dreams, but of course, with them having the right qualifications.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nMost definitely the only good thing this show did right, yeah, give me more of them crispy looking animations, those oddly-ordered lines make for such a relaxing view for my eyes. And honestly, without this, the show would have never stand on its feet.\r\nThe color palette was so diverse and colorful, taking a non-realistic art style that really suited this show for being the genre it is. One of the many things I appreciate about Fuuka (rare of me to say) was the sense of fashion, the characters looked as if they were staging for some world-class clothing magazine, all looked very tidy and elegant, and I'm backing this up for you, hips out there. One thing that really left a bad taste on my memory was that adults, kids, and teenagers, all looked similar with no signs of aging gaps, I'm talking about parents looking as young if not younger than their kids, it was ridiculous.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nBeing a show heavily centered on music, that is if we don't count the childish drama. Those were some really good songs, to be honest, I didn't give the opening theme song credits at first, but it grew on me as far as making me want to clap for them when they decided to feature it as one of their hits on some episodes. The voice acting was decent but could have been better if not for the painfully cringy dialogue they put the actors through. And then again, there is the classic Engrish, one of the strongest, in fact. I really have to emphasize more on how good the music was or else I'm not going to get this unlucky feeling off that I'm getting right now.\n\r\n- Character (6/10):\r\n\u201cNext please\u201d, that would have been my quote of the day if I was in charge of recruiting actors for a live action and replicas of the show's characters happened to be involved. There was no single memorable character that brought something new with it. You had your friendship above all types of people, and there was also the selfish bastard that goes about ruining everything the show built upon for 10 episodes. 10!!!!! are you kidding me?\r\nShipping was really intense at first, but then, it was like, why even bother, just let this end quickly I don't wanna get rid of my dropped-shows-virginity yet. I can give the protagonist credit at least for curing his addiction to Twitter, but that was it. And to this day, I don't think I'll even know how could someone with no talent in a medium perform that well in it, and in such a short time, it really goes as far as contradicting the philosophical meaning of a \u201cTalent\u201d.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nIt's very odd to have animals like pigs that eat practically anything that they can swallow, but what's even more mindblowing is how could one enjoy something they criticise this bad. I'm not going to lie on myself, I did have a bit of guilty pleasure watching Fuuka, not because of some deep plot points, not because of the revolutionary characters, but rather how decent it served as a time killer. At least it didn't put me to sleep at night or made me count how many times I yawned every 3 minutes. I had my fair share of rooting, shipping and cheering, but towards the end, it dropped massively.\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\r\nFuuka is a type of show I'm going to be very careful about calling it a good show out loud, there is no way in hell I'll recommend this as a solid romance experience for how bratty and unfunny the drama turned out to be. As for me, seeing that many shows already makes me realize how low in scale this appears next to greater franchises, but for you out there who are planning to have this as one of their first takes on the romance genre, please don't, it would end up affecting your tastes in a bad way.\n"

            "content": "\n                It's a shame that nowadays shows like \u201cAyakashi: Japanese Classic Horror\u201d are on the verge of extinction for how different the storytelling varies between a normal standalone show and one that pacts along multiple stories each with its own context.\r\nWith the word \u201chorror\u201d in the title, it was probably something they added in the English translation to add more intrigue to the series, I was personally drawn to it with simply reading that word alone, goes to show how effective and clever that methods of selling something is, but it turned out nothing more than a sneaky click bait. A bait set up way backin 2006 and still did its number on me, but that was nothing compared to the impact some of the presented stories had, and given their origin is several centuries ago is only more astonishing.\r\n\u201cAyakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,\u201d tells three different stories from the of a traditional Japanese background that deals heavily on supernatural and spiritual concepts, something that still today far fetched and questionable to tackle. But as they say, not every apple in the barrel is a divine one.\n\n\r\nStory (7.8/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Stories of revenge have always been told by masses, probably because how relatable of a motive it is for most human beings, but not every outcome of it is served tidely. As cold as it philosophy behind it, it remains quite cheesy most of the time and hard to buy, and most of the time, easy to grasp. Person A holds grudge against person B and sets for revenge, it's how it's always been, so simple and yet unforgiving, right?\r\nYotsuya Kaidan took a more complicated approach to that by introducing a lot of key characters and a wider conflicting timeline of events by not only discussion a revenge quest but managing two related stories of the same depth with twists almost every ten minutes worth of material that it becomes quite predictable and overwhelming later on, it really wears out the storytelling and makes it somewhat less interesting, like how fast major turnouts are introduced. Had it been a longer series, it would have definitely worked out for the better.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (7/10): Love stories are probably the most common type of storytelling that comes from tradition, it's not only a source of honesty and pride but also a drug that renders the most honorable of men into a brainless addict looking for the sweet overdose of meth that is his lover.\r\nWhat started as a casual honest Samurai with a respectable wage, and a loving girlfriend, ended up as a controversial cheater of a kind he never predicted. The story felt pretty plain for the most part, but it was the execution that made it stand out a little bit.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.5/10): Probably the only faithful entry out of the three for the word \u201chorror\u201d in the series' title. As short and concise as it was, started out of nowhere and made itself wrap up very quickly making you begging for more (Mononoke is a spin-off of this 3 episodes long tale, thank God there is more.). Both horrifying and saddening, and at the same time beautiful (Visually, more on that later) and fun, it tackles the story of a mysterious medicine seller that tries to exorcize a monster targetting a select members of a household, trying his best to drag the darkest secrets they were keeping, the secrets that made the monster look nothing more than a cute kitten compared to what they truly were.\n\n\r\nArt (6.6/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (7.5/10): In my opinion, out of the three stories, this one had the most realistic artistic choice, not only its use of dark colors and gloomy lighting and shading was toned down to compliment the portrayed era, but people's anatomy and facial expressions were more or less on point with the heavy use of Japanese attire of course. Speaking about the art style here and not the animation, as the latter was an entirely other story while nothing mind-blowing, it managed to keep you focused on what's important.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (4.5/10): This series was seriously a let down when it came to visuals, and the visual alone is probably the most important aspect that an Anime should master, not only is it the magnet for a new audience but it's what carries the plot ahead. The character anatomy was just horrible, talking here about the faces, most the most part, they were distorted and poorly traced, they felt very cheap and lazy, and that's not to talk about the bad use of colors and shading, it was like setting up a high value for gamma output on an old display device, it was just horrible. Could as well make it to my top-poorly-animated list.\n\r\nBakeneko (8/10): While not as realistic as the first story's, Bakeneko is definitely the winner here, talking artistically. Everything felt like staring at an old Japanese abstract painting that has taken some beating from time.\r\nHowever, don't let the old atmospheric touch of weariness fool you because it can suddenly fill the screen with beautifully animated frames that make your eyeballs almost jump out and eat the sweet candy it sees in front of it.\r\nI'm talking about some serious webgen level animation that might sound from this paragraph like it won't fit the portrayed style, but believe me, that was some of the best-animated sequences I've seen.\n\n\r\nSound (8.1/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (8/10): The soundtracks in this one highlighted the revenge aspect tackled by the story very well and that didn't fall short on delivering a great performance from the voice acting cast's part, they surely were some talented individuals.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (8/10): Despite the poor production animation-wise, they really did this show justice when it came to vocals in general that I feel like the voice acting cast did the series a great deed by having it finally stand on its own, some great performances those were, the sound of a desperate couple confessing, the madness on a wife watching her husband cheating on her, all of those feelings were just so natural.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.5/10): The medicine seller's voice actor, need I say more? And that's not to say that the others fell short on delivering, well, he was surely the stare of the performance, the way he calmly talks, it highlights how the animation had his face muscles move, you could almost swear the said frame is alive and consciously talking. The sound effects were another thing. They had a heavy use on scattered camera focus to help convoy the horror element of the story, and sound effects played a huge role in racing that to being even more impactful and horror-worthy. Nothing of the cheesy jump scares sfx or anything like that.\n\n\r\nCharacter (7.1/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Just what I like about a well-written plot. Interesting enough character to complement the events, I mean, if you're doing a world-class commercial, you're best to have a modal feature your merchandise than a normal fella passing through the street.\r\nAs wide as the character cast was, and given the complex background they came from, even for a western head that's foreign to the Japanese culture was able to connect and understand their motive. Most of them at least is a well developed and fleshed out as both key and side characters.\r\nThe bad folks aren't bad just because, they are given a reason, something that defies the classic rotten bad guy, after all, everyone is born pure but then decides what route to take.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (6/10): I mean, I want to say that I've seen more interesting wooden planks, mostly for how amusingly humiliating it is, but also for how really blunt a character they were. Aside from the Goddess Tomi Hime, we never got any characters that actually explained their origins to back up their decisions later, and even the Goddess after fleshing out herself still didn't make any sense for how she ended up like and how everybody involved just coped with it. A lot was left open for interpretation and it wasn't even justified why.\n\r\nBakeneko (7.5/10): I would have loved if they presented more intriguing figures, the medicine seller was really one of a kind, without a doubt, the best character from all of the stories. But one character couldn't possibly make an excuse for every other character, right?\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): It was certainly more of a chore at the beginning to keep up with complex Japanese names (I'm from an entirely different cultural background myself, so no wonder), but once you get past that, you get a lot of thrilling moments and shocking plot twists. Very immersive, just the type of show that gets better and better on every re-watch as you get more familiar with the characters and the historical background of the told story.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (6.5/10): Not quite as good compared to the other two, but still a better love story than Twilight for sure. The characters were far interesting for me to care about and the art style and animation didn't help either.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.3/10): I was totally treated to something I never was ready for. Before diving into it, I had the first story \u201cTetsuya Kaidan\u201d as my favorite, but as soon as I got into it I knew that wasn't the case anymore. This story did a lot of things right and it was only 3 episodes, the shortest one out of the three. I loved the medicine seller as a character and I adored the premise behind the story and the theme it handled perfectly. If I was going to recommend this series, Bakeneko is probably going to make 70% of the decision.\n\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10):\r\nYotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): Really amazing revenge story with its own twists and unique conclusion that breaks the fourth wall even, a definitive classic for me.\n\r\nTenshu Monogatari (6.4/10): It did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I would probably end up forgetting about it in a matter of months, if any time I'm re-watching the series, this certainly wouldn't be something to look forward to.\n\r\nBakeneko (8.1/10): Certainly one of my all-time favorites now, and I would totally re-watch it like crazy from this point on.\n\r\nIf you're going to watch the series, I highly recommend watching all three arcs on your own decision and decide for yourself, after all, I could just be a sucker for real horror and not so much for romance, you can never know.\n"

Saying that these shorts had no story is like saying every comedy slice of life show doesn't have one. It's just the focus wasn't around the story but the characters and their interactions.\r\nthese 2 minutes long 7 episodes go through some funny conversation between Angelo and Nero and having Corteo as a guest of honor appearing very rarely every now and then.\n\r\n- Art (6.0/10):\r\nVery Chibiand minimalistic art style used, it wasn't intended to be taken seriously, so there was no hold off on the goofiness. It worked fine I guess.\n\r\n- Sound (6.3/10):\r\nAgain, there had to be a dubbed version, I went through a lot of trouble to find the series at the first place, and then to separately find the translated script and read along the seconds, it was more like a chore than enjoyment to me. The voice acting felt comedic, but the soundtrack was lacking.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nAgain, what's not to like about Angelo, Corteo, and Nero? Three fellas having some fun time, being them tasting booze or just goofing around. It was all for fun.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.5/10):\r\nThis wasn't the least one of my highlights with watching anime, no, I didn't laugh hysterically, and I don't think I even cracked a genuine laugh, but it sure was a decent 14 minutes time killer.\n\r\n- Overall (5.8/10):\r\nI wouldn't recommend this or say it's one of these gems, the comedy wasn't all that good, and the jokes were blunt, so it's safer to skip on this if you had better stuff to do. But in case you are like me, have plenty of time on your hand and can't think of anything else to do, why not try this out?\n"

            "content": "\n                2018, animation, and the Anime industry, in general, has gotten pretty far, and with a huge selection from multiple animation works that were produced over the years, it becomes hard to find worthy series and/or movies to watch, let alone enjoy and remain in your memory enough to tell to people another. In the midst of pills of different picks that consist of all sorts of genres that mostly span as action or fantasy titles are found as glowing gems in the floor of the ocean, could this one be a legit gem? we shall see.\r\n\u201cOokami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki\u201d, or \u201cWold Children\u201d isa tale that might appear pale and predictable in comparace to others, but has a lot more to offer, its biggest focus is treasuring family bonds no matter the hardships. And it's nice to catch a fresh breath once in a while.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nOn the surface, Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki's plot feels very predictable and not too relatable, after all, not all of us went through the same things as the portrayed characters, and yet, the story stands out surprisingly very well and feels different, not like any other. The execution was key, the calm progression pace was the lead here. Although the story focused on a slice of a select character's life that averages about 12 to 13 years, nothing felt rushed.\r\nMeet Hana, a 19 years old hardworking college student that one day meets this charming werewolf and fell in love with him. Shortly after they had two babies that both were born as werewolves too, and the story picks up from there. Hana, a girl so young suddenly was exposed to this massive harsh world with people to take care of leaving behind all of her dreams to make her abnormal children happy without risking exposing their truth to other people.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nImagine having to take a bite out of the most [insert your favorite fruit here], now Imaging you can actually taste it with your eyes, that would be the feeling you get when looking at this beautiful artwork.\r\nThe art style, like how non-CG, character faces are drawn looks very chunky and uninteresting, but it was the colors and the work that went to blend everything up together with those yet amazing lively interactive background what made it stand out to be its own thing.\r\nThis movie takes place around rural areas, for the most part, so the production team unleashed their creativity and depicted one of the most eye ammuzing drawn/animation vegetation and environment, the way leaves and grass dance with the wind and everything, just Ughh.\r\nThey also went crazy with the details in pretty much everywhere you look, the slightest raindrop has a character to it, accurately sliding properly on the given surface it lands on, and let's how to ignore how well done was those umbrellas being torn in the midst of storms. Absolutely, a sweet, sweet eye candy.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThe deal with Japanese Anime is, most of the time, wrong character voice acting is done either bad, or is just unfitting for certain characters, like how an adult or even an old lady would still have a voice that of a child, I paid extra attention to this in this movie, trying to see how distinguishable were the voices of the mother, a young adult, and her toddler kid girl. And I got to say, they knew what they were doing, the voices just fit the faces they were vocing for flawlessly, the elderly had that stuttering tone to their voice, and you could capture the clumsiness and cuteness in the kid's voices as well. Adults sounded very mature and natural on all sorts of emotions making them more believable.\r\nThe soundtracks deserve a praise of their own too, the right music hit my eardrums at the right times, portraying their intended emotions very well, and the selection of the records was great as well.\n\r\n- Character (9.8/10):\r\nThis is how character developement should be, it's almost been redefined by this exact definition.\r\nThroughout the plot progression, you get to see the change in all of the characters, how all their experiences affect them for the better, or the worse. All characters had good motives for what they do, all of them were acting realistically and relatable as well, like the little kid, Ame being so lonely and with no friends that kept complaining about how human hate wolves because he noticed how evil wolves are written in children's tales, you really get to see how they make good, no, great use of the world building here.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10.0/10):\r\nThis was one of those animations that never let me drop focus or interest in continuing watching, I never asked myself what time it was, or how much is it for the movie to finish, I just sat down expecting a clich\u00e9 story, and got more than I bargained for. This one of those movies that I ought to re-watch at least every 2 years or so with friends and family, and deffinetely recommend on so many occasions.\n\r\n- Overall (9.0/10):\r\nIf you're still questioning whether you should give this one a chance then rest assured, there's nothing top working about, this is a very wholesome family-friendly movie, with some mature content to it, like a makeout between a human and a wolf a the beginning, and even a nipple slip later on, unless you're fine with that, you have such a great story to see.\n"

Normally, you'd release a recap episode that goes prior to watching the movie but no, I guess the material they wanted to cover could not stretch appropriately to movie pacing.\n\r\nThe story at hand follows the continuation of where the Anime left off, so you could say, this is more of a sequel than a spin-off movie, it tackles the legendary party of adventurers that they have been building up since episode one and gives a motive for Goblin Slayer and his parties to get involved. The arc was just another Goblin Slaying/Rescue operation that had the parties o the usual, infiltrate a Goblin nest and hack n' slash until they make it to the boss, only rehashing with nothing new, it feels more like a grinding sided-mission that buys-off time for \u201csomething\u201d to happen.\n\r\nFor a movie, the animation was more or so, lackluster, this could have been easily a three episodes sequel and nobody would have complained.\n"

You really never see the show for what it is until you watch this much, toned down, easy to follow, slow-paced episodic peek into the characters' lives.\n\r\nThe art style speaks of itself, it dumbs down the composition of everything visual, so much so that it brings back out character under a new brush so much so thatthe entire framework feels different, but that's not entirely bad as it does make for the cutest, most hearing baby goblins ever.\n\r\nThe comedy feels not much different from what we're used to from the show, some of it even comes up as a rehearsal of an already told joke in the parent show, only louder.\r\nThe characters are the same, only with all guards lowered and lunch more down to earth, it was a fresh coat of paint all in all.\n\r\nThe episodes felt very slow-paced, snail speed, I do not recommend binging this one at all, it really works better under a weekly show, slow and relaxing, it really does affects your experience the way you try to approach it.\n\r\nI feel like, especially compared to giants of a slice of life shows, this really does pale in comparison, it comes with nothing new to the table and is just there, extra filler for your favorite Isekai fantasy age of empires Anime.\n\r\nOverall: 6.6/10\n"

That's what my meme-loving side would love to say, but it seems, MAL does not allow for short reviews so I'll have to stall, or write an informative, distinctive essay. Take it as you will.\n\r\nI remember back in the day, I wanted to practice my writing skills, and as I was heavy on Anime even back then, I thought I could review every Anime I watched, and thus, win both the entertainment that comes with watching an Anime and the skills that develop after writing countless reviews left and right. That was 3 to 4 years ago, and alot changed during that time. I had this ONA scheduled for a review along with several other shorts, but it seems, for some reason, I ended up sleeping on it all of these years, until now. I think I would have tried to buy as much effort as possible, milking every drop of vocabulary I had ta the time, trying to create a meaningful review that breaks beyond the shallow backgrounds of the reviewed entries, but not anymore.\n\r\n\u201c001\u201d is a shitpost. The more I look at them, the more apparent it becomes as if an aspiring animator had his practicing samples leaked by somebody, and this one in particular, while not the absolute worst, it stands for an impressive display of basic animation techniques from a beginner's stand of point, and I'm no expert, but I can tell random scribbles from a Mona Lisa.\n\r\nMaybe the artist intended to deliver some kind of hidden message in all of that pixel real estate, an unknown figure crashing into what looks like a windshield only to be washed off seconds later, having his or her skin removed layer by layer, and off he or she went with the rest of rainwater. That can stand for an analogy about life, as the dripping rainwater is the time that passes the windshield is the a strong-willed person that runs through, discarding any fake friends (The figure that comes crashing the windshield) even if it was just a reoccurring pattern that never turns for the better.\n"

All major players got introduced making you think where it could go from here.\n\r\nAs all action was reserved for the final 4 to 3 episodes, not much can be said about the animation, but for the parts that required it, it was fantastic. The sound design though is just, *chef's kiss*.\n\r\nIt was one of those seasons that get you to sleep the night while at the same time shows you why you fell in love with the show in the first place.

What we wanted from a sequel was delivered in a mere 3 episodes (approximately 30 minutes each) of content, and nobody's complaining.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nThese animations tend to dive more into the characters, giving them more depth and backstories, driving their motives out, and even giving them more treats and characteristics we never knew they had.\r\nThe specials follow the same path as their ancestor, jumpingback and forth between timelines and places, but this time around as we already know the parent story, it's not as hard to keep up with, the thing that made it really good to invest in.\r\nIn addition to the main timelines, 1711, 1930, 1931, and 1932, other time periods were added in a purpose of presenting certain important and influential past events that made a lot of sense of other stuff. It's undoubtedly the pairing and ships that were the focus of this specials, while they went through telling how the couples made up after the events of the main story, while also shading some light on other initial immortals that we never got to see more about them.\n\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nThe animation was decent, or a better rephrase, above average, nothing to complain about. I would argue that the main show did it best with better quality, but the fast-paced moments also retained their flashiness.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nThey went back at it again with the perfect accent of the era, you can't help but blend in with the characters just focusing on their voice alone, the music was amazing as always, you can never get fed up with the classic jazz soundtracks that kick in every now and then.\n\r\n- Character (10.0/10):\r\nBaccano! has always managed this on itself with no backing up, the characters were always interesting and engaging, you can help but side with both the good and bad people. but with this specials, they had a lot more to them to show, there was the focus on Chane, Nice, and Jacuzzi, now she got those burn marks and how he got his tattoo and what for, stuff like this really make the interactions worth it.\r\nThere was a yet astonishing maniac introduced that compliments perfectly Ladd, it makes you wish he was present on the Flying Pussyfoot and lead the action.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nI enjoyed this more than I accounted for, I signed in for a sketchy watch, thinking I would just be lost in a great mess again, but it really was easy on the mind this time around, feeling like having the ultimate experience.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nI bet if you enjoyed the parent series, and actually understood the story, that would be all the assurance that you have several affections to multiple characters, these specials where like an expansion pack with the greatest features you could think off to your favorite game, why miss on it if you have the time and energy?\n"

A less-than-stellar translation might have dulled the impact of the song for some viewers, leaving them feeling underwhelmed.\n\r\nWhile the opening may not have resonated with everyone on a musical level, the animation and visuals are certainly noteworthy. The nice animations throughoutthe sequence offer a mix of traditional and 3D CGI scenes. Personally, I found the 3D CGI elements to be a highlight, adding a unique and modern touch to the overall presentation.\n\r\nIt's clear that the opening of Jujutsu Kaisen (TV) is a mixed bag for different viewers. The song's catchy beats and stunning visuals made it a favorite for some, while others found it lacking the desired impact. Nevertheless, the animation team deserves praise for the creativity and skill put into the visuals, which managed to impress many, including myself.\n\r\nIn the end, whether you loved it or found it flat, the opening remains an integral part of the Jujutsu Kaisen experience. It's a testament to the diverse range of tastes and preferences in the anime community. So, give it a watch and see how the opening resonates with you\u2014its energy and style may just grow on you with each viewing!\n"

            "content": "\n                Disclaimer: Story spoilers in the character's discussion paragraph.\n\r\nI like to watch my Anime in sequential order, that is, tracking down entries of a franchise I'm interested in watching in chronological order of release is almost a need for me, however, sometimes, sudden remakes make the jump, and I'm here left clueless of whether to experience the original entry or jump straight into the more popular, up-to-date release that has all the buzz talking about it. When Dororo was first announced and started serializing, that was a challenge for me to undertake, I didn't watch to m\u00f9iss out of the weekly hype bandwagon, so I decidedto go with the one that still has the scent of packaging, and leave the older adaptation for later to experience, perhaps watching the neer one is the way to go, as I was wishing that the production team will improve on the things that the original did wrong.\n\r\nI was satisfied, after finishing the 2019-recut, and thus, the need for watching the original series had already faded out a massive bit from what it was before, filling me with a sense of laziness that will have me go about seeing a daunting 26 episodes of black and white 50 years old animation when my backlog that has all sorts of highly praised series in it is still calling for me to dedicate the time and effort needed to seal them off for once and for good. Well, what do I have to do? So I bit the bullet and sat through what I was hesitating to watch the most. And it was quite the experience.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nI don't know what would be more shocking, seeing the original then jumping over to the recut or vice versa. Changes have been made, some for the better, but some, oh boy.\r\nJust like we set off from the recut, the original does it the same way on a narrative level, while changing up some details and character treats to suit the time period of its release. With an inspiring episodic pace, for each day its own story, which sometimes has to branch into a 2-episodes tale (A very familiar formula that we see the 2019-recut following).\n\r\nLooking at how the original tells its story, there were a lot of drop details that we didn't manage to get in the recut that are actually pretty pivotal and vitally consistent that make a lot of sense for some stuff that we never understood in the remake. Some story arcs were also missing, some of which I think make the best out of the original, like the animal abuse centric arc that I think was dropped from being re-adapted for obvious reasons.\n\r\nArt (6/10):\r\nWell, \r\nlet's be honest, it is 50 years old, and in black and white while at that. Now, it is not the aesthetic direction's fault per se, in fact, Dororo Pilotm the special episode that pre-dated this TV adaptation had colors, so the technology was there, however, they have made the right call of having it in white and black for how much atmosphere that alone adds to the scenery, demons are actually scary looking for once, and the backgrounds look so dead and rotten, perfectly conveying the tone of the narrative on a visual level.\n\r\nI was not a fan of the Astro-boy heavy inspired art style, but who is there to blame for that, at least Dororo fit that art style just nicely.\r\nMy only complaint really is the unnecessarily drag up still frames that some times would have certain characters star for lengthy periods before a fade-in transition happens which really hurts the pacing at some portions.\n\r\nSound (8.6/10):\r\n\u201cHoge Hoge Hogetara Heera Hera\u201d\n\r\nI was mesmerized. The last thing I was expecting to impress me, right after the visuals are the vocals. It is expected from something this old to have bad sound composition, but man, seriously, this one is up there with the best I've heard in Anime.\n\r\nThe voice acting was, well, very conflicted, there is so really well-done performance, like Dororo's (My favorite), the voice of a spoiled bratty child that feeds of making trouble, and you can tell that much and more just from hearing her voice, I might even put her performance slightly above, what the remake has. Hyakkimaru had a surprising deeper voice than I expected, but it grew on me more than the remake's did.\n\r\nBut the real star here was the OST and opening/ending theme song.\r\nLet me just reaffirm what Joey (The Anime Man) said, it is a freaking party bander. Well, I saw one of the comments describing it as \u201csomething that Dororo would sing, while the remake's opening was more like something that Hyakkimaru would sing\u201c. It is just a stupidly catchy song that I find myself signing it out lout even at the most serious of moments.\r\nThe OSTs are just phenomenal, most shows I watch, which still have some amazing audible compositions, this one just surprised me the most, given its age and dimmed popularity.\n\r\nCharacters (6.5/10):\r\nThere was a lot to be desired.\r\nThe only character I won't complain about is Dororo. Even her flaws are permissible given the bratty role she's enclaving, however, Hyakkimaru does not emit the proper vibes you'd get from a disabled doll seeking to slay back its humanity. For starters, he just can talk and then have enough confidence in calling Dororo out \u201cYou're just imagining what I'm saying by reading my mouth just a moment after he supposedly gained his speech back\u201d. Also, despite lacking other sense, he always acts like he doesn't and leaving it to a shameful lazy excuse to clear up the doubts when he finally gains whatever he lacked back. And don't even get me started of the Dororo's gender reveal at the end, it was just so random and sudden that it did not matter in the slightest.\n\r\nNota, the friendly dog was a welcomed member of the trio, I'm surprised they did not have him in the remake for how wholesome and fun he made everything when he was around.\n\r\nAh, Tahomaru, the persona people hated the most in the remake, saying that he lacked personality and proper development, well, will you even consider him a perper character in the original by any means? The dude screams of \u201cI'm unimportant\u201d, he had a trivial and minimal role in the whole story, like some side characters made more of an impression than him. And Daigo, well, he is more of a piece of shit in this one.\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10):\r\nFor the most part, Dororo to Hyakkimaru was daunting and kind of gritty when it came to watching it. Maybe modern Anime spoiled me far too much, but the series did have a lot of flaws, but also, some strong points that kept me going. It is hard to sit through the first half, but until you get used to it, it becomes like a bag of Doritos that you know is bad for you in large sums, but you still drill into its bottom anyway.\n\r\nOverall (6.82/10):\r\nI wouldn't necessarily have this as a recommendation, especially in this day and age where Anime is produced in a large mass. The remake is easily the best option for experiencing this story, at least, from an Anime perspective.\n"

            "content": "\n                \u201cRemember that show? Yes, the one everybody was obsessed about just a year ago where all the talk and shit was centered around, well; It's back again.\u201d - Nobody heard that.\n\r\nWhen it first came out, Kaguya-sama was all the fuss and trendy buzz, even after it finished, for a few months, the praise never stopped. Fast forward a year later a second season was due to release, something very unusual in the industry for a quality popular show to receive a sequel in such a relatively short time, I mean, nothing wrong was going to happen, it should work out just like it did withAttack on Titan after it's initial 4 years hiatus, the fans were there when it stopped and came back when it returned. Unfortunately, Kaguya-sama had it the opposite way.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nThe reason why the second season didn't have as much of a following as the first one will probably be a mystery, maybe people thought it ended, and word of a sequel never broke any louder, but the show over here felt like it never stopped, episode one is just a masked episode 13 that follows the same vibes and build-ups of the first season, making it for the perfect enter-season binge-watch that you can hope for. The quality did not suffer one drop, staying true to what made it great in the first place.\r\nMuch like the first season, the episode^s is packed with content that makes it seem impossible to fit and direct in the same episode, but they somehow do it and never overdose you with the show's greatness, every episode, or should I say, every third of an episode feels like a self-contained plot that's self-aware of its junky placement that never ceases to make sense chronologically, most of the mini-arcs are an episode or less long with a couple of them spanning 2 episodes at most.\r\nLast season may have been overly focused on the two main pair but this one felt like it had us more at home with the rest of the supporting cast and even introducing new faces and expanding on other. This is definitely a Kaguya-sama 2, both chronologically in terms of narrative and quality.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nLet's get it out of the way, there was nothing like the Chika dance in this season, but that one was more about the quirkiness of it than the visuals.\r\nKaguya-sama feels safe in the visual department, one reason being, the studio behind it, A-1 Pictures is more than capable of holding on their standards, and the second reason being, the genre, and flow of the narrative distances itself from being too dependant of the animation to carry everything else, however, the art style is a very experimentally unstable factor that really puts it over many other shows,l and don't get me started on the Sh\u014djo episode.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nNarrator-kun strikes back with an amazing record drop, after the opening of the first season, you'd think nothing will be as classy, but then they hit you with the Daddy Daddy Do magic. It lives up to the first opening, being so damn catchy and easy to Kareoke without having to risk summoning a legion of demons, although, it's debatable still.\r\nThe ending theme song is just as good, creating a good contrast from the comedy heavy, sometimes emotional episodes.\r\nThe voice acting is just as over the top as ever, I can't believe how even after a year, the voices of the characters were still engraved in my head that hearing them again felt like something I do on the daily basis.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nShows like Kaguya-sama (which are very few) really transcend the \u201ccharacter-development\u201d trope. Really, cherry-pick a random character from the show, they are not limited and or restricted to a linear development plan that forces them to act upon in order for the plot to progress forward, everyone is separated from the plot, very flexible and can adapt any situation that they find themselves into because the magic of this show is about the chemistry between them that's born from the most awkward set of inconveniences.\r\nLet's all agree, Ishigami was always best girl even with only season one's content, however, after seeing a couple of episodes he moved all the way on top of the ladder, which an amazing backstory that explains everything about him to the faintest of details.\r\nThe introduction of the new characters was a great addition that nobody knew they wanted this bad as the student council was always lively and cheerful, to begin with, but now, amp up that a few folds.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nEvery episode had bowls worth of tears from the excessive, sometimes unhealthy laughter, the season pushed some boundaries and even reminds you why the first season was so good. Something I never expected the show to manage is to set a higher ceiling even to itself.\r\nEvery episode felt like the same but had an entirely different set to go through, bringing in the new every minute, an amazing rom-com to its very roots.\n\r\n- Overall (9/10):\r\nHonestly, it couldn't get any better, but hey, just as it outdid itself, maybe a third season (please let it happen) might also do just that.\r\nKaguya-sama used to fill me with a love-hate feeling during the first season, maybe it had so\u00f9mething to do with its popularity, but when you ignore all of those stupid half-baked excuses you can finally see what the show has to offer. Season two was an extension of the land of the familiar, it delivered on all of the fantasies that we had about a sequel to the first season and even exceeded it, something sequels are infamous for not doing.\n"

            "content": "\n                Attack on Titan, it feels like everyone is pointing a gun at you the moment you decide to write a review about the show and especially now that the first half of the final season started airing. Attack on Titan has been the talk of the hour for years, but now, more than ever. So Here's one that won't offend anyone.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nAttack on Titan might have started its fame because of the action and hype-driven battles, but that shifted bit by bit till it became the classic literal masterpiece that everyone likes to claim it to be.\r\nThe final season started from the get-go on amuch darker tone than we used to, more mature and with higher stakes than ever. It's no longer a tale about the boy that wants to slaughter Titans, as every insignificant move can result in a worldwide conflict, the politics got more involved and an essential part of the story, even more so than season three, the revelations from the past season did not only impact the characters, but also the world and the passage of events.\r\nSeason by season, Attack on Titan only got more deserving of rewatches, as every season lead you to restart the series from season one episode one in fear that more things might have gone past you with little context or clue, the show has almost become a metaphor of its former self, heroes are not villains and vice versa, trust no one even the characters you empathized with for three earlier season.\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nThis is a controversial one. It's either Mappa's efforts into utilizing CGI more were a big mess or Wit studio put the bar higher than what Mappa could deliver on. What the series was famously praised on in the earlier season was the phenomenal use of dynamic 3D  cameras and the blend of 2D and 3D animation to the point of being impossibly noticeable is all gone, all that remains are grotesque and ugly 3D models used for the environment and Titan models, calling it ugly in this circumstance doesn't necessarily mean bad, it was decent 3D animation, far from bad, however, not as good as the three earlier seasons spoiled us about. I guess no matter how big production is, a studio change leaves grave marks.\r\nThe character designs are closer to the Manga's so that's a plus for Mappa, however, Wit did a flawless job on that that the Anime became so many people's headcanon.\r\nThe animation was the weakest part of this season, but not as bad as something that would ruin the experience, this season has more focus on the plot than action so it can easily be overlooked as it did not hinder what's important. The story. \n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nAnother controversial aspect of the show, I don't want to call out an entire fandom, but some people are just as mad as to send death threats to the show's staff just because they did not put their favorite OST on a certain moment, guys, grow up.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs followed the show's trend of actually keeping up the quality. The opening was something very, very different from what we're used to which I thought reflected perfectly the hellish atmosphere that engulfs this entire section of the story.\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\r\nThe best thing about a time-skip season is seeing how much the characters changed, Attack on Titan hit the nail so hard on this one that the cast is practically different people with the same names.\r\nTake these three characters as an example, Eren, Zeke, and Reiner.\r\nEren has definitely grown so much in the past three seasons but that did not come close to what he has become. Entire mood and charisma change, he really reflected the burden the entire island's expectations on him, he is no longer someone who wants to slaughter the Titans because of what they robbed him of, he is the key and hope of everyone that has been living on Paradise since ay one, thus making him an unstoppable force that won't fudge in front of anything and anyone who's holding him back. Taking a look at Zeke, the bastard hated the bad guy who did so much damage to the protagonists and their cause, cursed by so many fans has won back a great deal of following by showing a growth unmatched by most characters ending up as a non-shallow fellow who also has dreams and aspirations worthy of respect. The same goes for Reiner, the traitor backstabber that appears to be like the sweetest most loving big brother figure and mentor, he grew through his struggles and is still suffering from them as he shifts between both sides of living and death, he's had enough, but to what end.\r\nAnd it does not stop at that three characters,s every single character introduce earlier even for a split of a second got time to shine and show how much it has progressed. Other than the familiar faces we grew to hate and love, so many new characters were introduced, and even moments after their introduction felt like fellas that we knew since day one, perhaps due to the parallel similarities in the case of Eran and Gabi for example, but that's a discussion for another day.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nIt's apparent, anyone watching four seasons of a show loves it enough to give it as many chances like that. Season four was a breed of its own, quite symbolic that everything changes even the story shifts as the production studio changed, signaling a metaphorical end to an era and the beginning of a new one. A round every conversation's conclusion lies a shocking revelation or a story changing confession, things changed faster than most people can keep up and it's a point of strength in Attack on Titan's case as it was made from the ground up to make more and more sense as you keep rewatching it over and over again.\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10):\r\nA good show gives, but a great show keeps on giving, Attack on Titan doesn't o that by the seasons but by the episode, no wonder it got to the place it's now. It's almost Attack on Titan IS the Anime fandom at this point, everyone is talking about it, every conversation is revolving around it, it's almost as anyone not into it is not even in the Anime fandom, to begin with. I know that's a toxic thought to share, I don't believe in it but everyone makes it out to be the absolute truth. This season is a wild card, it's either liked or loved, nothing in between, people who adore the previous season may detest it, and people who disliked all earlier seasons might fall in love with it, that's how different everything was about this season.\n"

            "content": "\n                Akame ga Kill! Theater is a compilation of shorts parodying the parent series \u201cAkame ga Kill\u201d. As dark as the original turned out to be, many fans wished for a more lightweight comedy centered parody to light up the heart. And as bad the original turned up to be (facts) ONA had no effect on that.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nThe story as a leading aspect here was absent, but for a good reason, and that's what parodies are all about, instead, humor and jokes make up for that. It seemed as if all the jokes throughout the entire ONA were a direct reference going in sync withthe original, making fan of some characters just for the heck of it, trying desperately to push some laughs out of us, but unless you were a hardcore fan that you'd feel bad if you didn't laugh on the dry jokes, you would most of the time have a straight face of confusion, screaming \u201cWhy am I even watching this\u201d.\n\r\n- Art (6.0/10):\r\nNot the most aesthetic thing you will ever see that's for sure, but despite that, I feel there is a point behind it, you want to portray your characters in a cuter way, a more Chibi and minimalistic picture to compliment the childish humor, Which I understand, however, it could have been better, shows like \u201cAttack on Titan: Picture Drama\u201d did this better in my opinion.\n\r\n- Sound (4.0/10):\r\nYeah, I couldn't care less, there were no opening or ending theme songs to leave an impression, but because of the short length of the episode, there was no need for them anyways. It leaves us at the soundtrack collection which was totally non-existent. The voice acting wasn't a big deal here either, just a bunch of narration for a collection of dull jokes.\n\r\n- Character (0/10):\r\nThe parent show did horribly its characters, I remember rating it a 1/10, but this was way worse. So much for a parody, there was nothing that stands out, even the Chibi appearance wasn't fitting for most of them, I would argue only Kurome and Akame looked cute, the rest no so much. Lubbock was a straight out punching bag for physical abuse for no apparent reason, I don't know what even made them think that beating down someone is a funny sight to see, you'd think they would consider limiting it as much as possible as it would get old very fast, but no, the guy took the beating any way. And then comes Leone, of course, she didn't leave a good taste in my memory for what she did in the original show, but this was just despicable, nothing but a magnet for fanservice, that's all she was good for from the start.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (2.0/10):\r\nIf only I knew what I was signing up for, it was a total waste of time. I've seen better parody shows in my days, I guess I just hit bedrock with shitty parody shows here, I haven't cracked a smile, I haven't felt any good vibes around this or anything that made me think \u201cThis is fun\u201d. Other than hearing some familiar voices all over again, nothing cut the cake.\n\r\n- Overall (3.6/10):\r\nWell, I'm never recommending the original show anyway, why even bother with this one. And I totally understand that everybody has a unique taste, for the fans of the series out there that enjoyed it way more than I did, this is still not worthy of your time, but, if you still insisted on more content of the series, you might just give it a try, I won't promise anything though, it might end up ruining the series for you, or maybe the complete opposite, you might turn up to enjoy it somehow, and even manage to update your character qualities based on it.\n"

            "content": "\n                Ah, Snickers. The candy bar that claims to \"cure hunger.\" And now, they've paired with the titan-slaying anime, \"Attack on Titan.\" The concept is \"Attack Celebrity,\" where they've super imposed titan versions of Japanese celebrities into the show and swapped out the blades with Snickers bars. Talk about a sugar rush, right?\n\r\nBut really, did we need this? After the Snickers x Dr. Stone ads that still haunts my dreams, I was hoping for a change of pace. Unfortunately, Snickers seems to be lacking in originality. Instead of coming up with something new and fresh, they decided to just ride on the coattails of a popularanime.\n\r\nBut wait, let's talk about something else. Have you ever noticed how the moon changes shape every day? I mean, one day it's a tiny sliver, the next day it's a big, round ball in the sky. And yet, every single time, we're still just as amazed. What's up with that?\n\r\nAnyway, back to the Snickers x Attack on Titan ad. The humor just didn't fly for me. I guess I was expecting more out of this collaboration. They could have at least tried to make it original, or at least tried to make it funny. But I guess Snickers and Attack on Titan were both just phoning it in. I guess they just figured, \"Hey, let's throw some famous people in there and call it a day.\"\n\r\nAlas, the world will never know what could have been if Snickers and Attack on Titan had tried a little harder. But I suppose that's the price we pay for lazy advertising.\n"

            "content": "\n                It's very fortunate for us fans to have gotten a second season of Dr. Stone not long after season one ended, and man, what a season has it been, although, not of the same length, but still managed to pack so much content that it felt like a three cour season that we finally realize, unironically, the story is only started, for what these two last seasons were only the prologue of a long and complex story that stretches as far as the horizon and beyond.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nAfter the reveal of the title of the season a year ago \u201cStone Wars\u201d, many fans were worried thatthe series is heading for what it doesn't excel at the most. Warfare. After the mediocre mini-tournament arc of the first season, we all agreed that if anything the series fails at is action-centric combat, it is the perfect show that brings the nerd out of us, the type that dislikes physical conflict and craves science and intellect, so it was a natural reflex for most of it to get turned off by the title alone, fearing it's going to be one gigantic battlefield with blood and slaughter only for Boichi to dunk on us and introduce us to what's probably the best part of the show, narratively speaking.\r\nThe plot feels more fast-paced, adapting several chapters each episode which keeps you on your toes the whole episode which twists and turns especially nearing the end of the season.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nSeason one taught us it was never about industry-defining animation, and more about an onion enjoying science and building civilization, it was good enough to not such and bad enough to not stand out but it was not holding back the show, which is most important.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nIf not for the opening and ending theme songs, both seasons would have been on the same rank when it comes to sound composition, but I would be lying if I gave the win to this season, although the opening and endings were good, there were not as good as season 1's.\r\nThe voice acting was not that much different either, the same performance all way around.\n\r\nCharacters (9.2/10):\r\nI gotta give it to this season character-wise, for starters, the cast is bigger than ever but also, more intimate and varying. So many good characters are introduced and expanded upon, even Tsukasa grows as a character and shows real remorse. Development at its peak was documented this season, no complaints here.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nWatching the first season, I fear that with how much I liked it there was never going to be another season of the same show that compares, but luckily, I was proven wrong, it's just how the series works, almost an afterthought. The essence of the story remained the same, only with a bigger cast and riskier stakes.\n\r\nOverall (9.04/10):\r\nI see no reason for skipping this season, if you enjoyed the first season, you would love this one, if you didn't like the first season, you would enjoy this one, it's an upgrade through and through.\n"

The song itself is a high-energy, guitar-driven track with catchy hooks and a driving beat that keeps the listener engaged from start to finish.\n\r\nThe music video takes this energy and amplifies it with its dark, complex visuals that incorporate references to the popular manga series Chainsaw Man. The video follows a group of characters as they navigate a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world filled with demonic creatures and supernatural powers. The action is intense and fast-paced, with the characters using their abilities to fight for survival in this dangerous world.\n\r\nOne of thehighlights of the music video is the way it uses the themes and imagery of Chainsaw Man to enhance the overall mood and atmosphere of the song.

The focus on Eris in this episode is particularly noteworthy, as we get to see a different side of her character. The introduction of Cliff also adds an excitingnew dynamic to the story.\n\r\nIn my opinion, this one is a must-watch, even though Cliff will not play any part in the story for now, but he is an important element in the second season of the show and it would be better if you get introduced to him earlier to build up expectations.\n"

It's then that you realize that show is special, but for it to do it not once, but twice? Now that's an impactful piece of media.\r\nWhen I first watch the first season more than a year ago, I thought it couldn't get any more empty inside, fast forward now, after finishing the second season, I don't think I'm gonna survive this one.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nI'm not grading a critical marvel here, it's no Attack on Titan, after all, it's a harem show, so the story meanssomething entirely different in this context.\r\nThis one embodies what every sequel should thrive to be, it introduces so much and improves on what was introduced earlier. Is this the best harem or what? For what i's worth, it nails down every bullet point in the handbook and innovates at the same time. The pacing is great, so much can happen in the first half of the episode alone, feeling you so much content and quickly that your heart starts racing, rivaling that of the characters involved.\r\nThis season waste no time expanding on the backstories that were hinted n the first season and tie them back to the present events perfectly whilst also managing to squeeze more questions about who is who and what is what. \n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nDefinitely, an improvement over the first season, although at the beginning, it had some questionable changes like Futaro's eye color change and some of the color grading, overall, it looks nicer and more modern.\r\nAlthough the same as the first season, the character design was the best in this one, it captured the cuteness of each of the girls perfectly making us wishing for more.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nThe opening song from the first season is iconic at this point, I don't know how they did it but they came up with an equally wholesome and catchy one for this sequel too, almost felt like an unreleased vers of the first opening theme song.\r\nThe voice acting in this one was beyond amazing, remember season one, only better. I don't know what but I swear everyone sounds cuter and more tender than ever. Not only the dialogue was carried out perfectly but also the sentence interruptions and ambient sound they make with their mouths, it felt genuine and involving.\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\r\nThere, I typed it, 10/10 everybody, I had already decided on this one when I was only 4 episodes in, let me elaborate.\r\nUesugi just has to be my favorite harem protagonist, he's not dense, and he's not a shameless horny teenager either. He acts with logic and consideration to all of the girls and thinks twice before speaking, I just love that. He doesn't feel like a dummy being manipulated by the plot, but more like vice versa.\r\nThe of the girls have grown so much between the two seasons. A character development like which I never saw, and I'm talking literally here, I don't spite big statement like this on a whim before rethinking it over dozens of times. I swear to God, all the girls feel different from what they started, especially Nino who magically went from my most hated to nearly converting to her ship, and even Yotsuba, how can my heart falter from the Miku ship that I have been a member of since day 1? And Ichika's subtle drastic development that nearly flipped the entire series on its head? And Itsuki's schemes that keep all others on their toes, it's like the first season was advocating to \u201cWhy can't we all have him equally\u201d while this season was more like \u201cI want him to myself\u201d.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nI swear not a single episode, not a single moment, not a single second was eye-rolling or dull, I would start an episode and before I know it, the ending song is already playing, episode by episode, it's been a long time since I last binged a season in one sitting, and this speaks a lot about how good this show is. By far, my favorite harem and might as well be my favorite romance so much so that I'm already planning a rewatch.\n\r\nOverall (9.3/10):\r\nI truly believe that this show can get even non-harem fans into the genre. It doesn't rely on cheap Ecchi scenes to sell out its premise, it's all wholesome games and conversations that play into the great scheme of things making it in my opinion the perfect waifu warzone for those who like this type of stuff. In my opinion, as far as modern harems go, The Quintessential Quintuplets is a much watch.\n"

But unlike the parent show, disbanding any minor or major drawbacks, weak character portrayals, and slow plot progression, they both go about two different yet related side stories of victims of the Shiki invasion. While the first episode takes the narrative on a Shiki perspective,they are both the verdict but also a victim of circumstance, going through the horror and regret that hey carry on their second chance of a life that's more dead than they were in their coffin, you get to empathize and show a soft side for some of the Shiki and actually partly blame the villagers on this mindless crusade that they made an excuse for bland mass murder.\r\nJust as you're about to take a side, the second episode navigates you through a paralleled perspective that shares the same decline, the same setting, the same crime, but its spotlights are on a different victim. A terrifying sit through how someone goes from being a loving, easy-going mother to a gloomy, scary-looking lady that you'd tell your kids to never approach.\n\r\nThese two coupled episodes help with the conflicted narrative of who is right and who is wrong. It feels that these specials are everything that the parent show wanted to convey, but miserably failed at, same problem different perspective was the way the series should have been, but instead, it was the same problem and badly communicated minds.\n"

            "content": "\n                Every once in a while, an Anime that breaks the mainstream seasonal formula kicks in, but most of the time it ends up scaring off potential fans very early on. A kappa sucking off acorns with rocking music, not a lot of people are into that, but the topping on the case was never a measurement for how it tastes like.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nI find it very fascinating how fast it went from a mysterious, serious looking vibe emitter to some of the weirdest imagery you'll ever see.\r\nToi, Enta, and Kazuki, three teenagers with their respective stories get involved in a sketchy monarchy masterminded by aKappa named Keppi. They've always thought they've had it bad until the latter transformed them into Kappas with grace in a style that can keep a straight face while fighting a serious fight as they fabulously pose every 10 seconds or so.\r\nWhat I described on the few lines above or at least tried to, is the very abstract description that one can get up rolling in their heads upon watching the first couple of episodes or so. But really, it pulls up its own pace and reveals on the greater story bit by bit.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nWild, crisp, mystic, I really can't phrase it in an audible term. It has a cartoonish feel to it, but still feel very Anime, art-style in mind of course.\r\nFor a mortifying concept, you'd really miss anticipating the production value it's going have, but not until you see it, the animation has so many frames than an Indie game running on the latest hardware, and that's no stretching it, it really helps sell out the abstract formulas on the screen.\n\r\n- Sound (8.8/10):\r\nIt honestly hit the note just in the right place you keep you satisfied, for a show that has a lot of vocal performances in it, everything from openings and endings, to the soundtrack to miscellaneous songs was one of the best this season, the voice acting was also on part with all the high-quality content from the get-go.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nI wouldn't say it was revolutionary when it came to presenting a character that you can relate to, it simply did it with the most efficient way possible, even after hitting you with the Kappa thing, you still cried for them, laughed with them and cheered for every one of them.\r\nFor a story that went along the trio strengthening their bond, you could see the character development they carried, which showed that all the Shirikodama (Don't Google this) thingy wasn't for nothing.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.8/10):\r\nI was not ready, on so many levels to step into this, I was only interested in watching the series after I saw the infamous butt sucking scene from one of Gigguk's videos, and then it gave me a story I never expected to receive in a similar show, which made me glad I took interest in this series in the first place.\n\r\n- Overall (8.42/10):\r\nJust watch it, it's really easy to sleep on this show, very underrated and looked down upon, but seriously, just give it a try. Don't get scared by the ridiculousness that is Kappas put you off, because as much of a relationship it has with the show it's not all the show is concerned about, it has much more to offer and sleeping on it will be such a loss.\n"

            "content": "\n                Deadman Wonderland, it's not every day you come across a combination of complete opposite terms describing an idea, having the reader read Deadman and then to tone it down including Wonderland at the point of the tongue's resting. sneaky bastard those are. but as edgy the show tries very hard to be, the title of the series at least compliments that. This one of those shows that meets a lot of hate and criticism, some say it sucks, some call it a masterpiece, others hide behind the fact that the manga was better. But no matter how good or bad the source material is, theadaptation is an entirely different work that can have a lot of issues on its own, slow-pacing, event-skipping, filler and more.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nOn one of those lovely quite days, a major incident took place in Tokyo, a humongous explosion that ended up erasing great landscapes in an out-of-this-world manner. 10 years later, A private prison had already rested on the exact same location the explosion originated from, under the name of Wonderland that uses its prisoners as a source of entertainment for other people putting them in death battles, challenges, events. And keeping a spare of interesting residents are test subjects.\r\nA naive middle school student, Ganta, gets framed for killing his entire classmates by some of the prison's officials and as consequence, he's sent to Wonderland to serve his sentence. Filled with hatred and Anger towards the Red Man that massacred his friends, he strives to get his revenge. If you're still wondering about the \u201cDeadman\u201d part in the title, that's a term used to refer to people that have a special power called \u201cThe Branch of Sin\u201d that allows the users to control their blood in a manner that enables them to fight, we're talking about bloody swords, tentacles, bullets...etc. Cool huh? Well, the idea and everything is there, but the execution was not what you'd call a great job. In a lot of other shows, slow pacing kills off a lot of the hype and story progression, but in this one, there was a pacing very fast that the story itself couldn't keep up in a steady way, and thus rendered most of the event blurry and dull. The action starts up very early on, but I'm really not the type of guy that gets impressed by flashy colors and butterflies, in this case, gore and violence. Yes, I do enjoy my gory anime, but only if it was done right and in concise doses, and I'll spare Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate from this because those had their reasons. As I mentioned before, this is like that edgy early teen boy that thinks he is cool and badass just because he can spit off slurs and throw in partial nudity and excessive gore every 3 minutes, no, that's not the way to do it. A lot of very important plot points got skipped and never were explained, and most of the flashback characters were never officially introduced or given a proper reason on how they disappeared.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nIf anything, they did not slack off animating blood, and thankfully they didn't, seeing how it plays a major role than just acting like a dumb liquid that needs every excuse to splash around (Why am I getting worked up over blood? lol). Something I like here was the character designs, I have to give some extra points just for that, no crazy hairstyles, no inhuman anatomy or anything from that caliber, but still, it had its own cartoonish taste, and fed perfectly their sadistic smiles with life and horror. And I'm dead serious, those were some really terrifying evil smiles that could alone immobilize you. The way the fights where animated made up for the horrible story progression in my eyes. I never knew I was into good liquid animation until I saw how fluid their blood flowed (literally). I'm queuing up some GIF of blood projectiles at the moment of writing this review just for how satisfying they felt when they hit the target.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nLet's talking about the opening and ending theme songs and get them out of the way. The opening is unforgettable, and seeing how it has English lyrics all the way till the end makes it a bit easy on the memory, sounding as savage as the show wants to pretend to be like, and as the first lyric says \u201cSlit the throat of reason and reality\u201d, that alone prepares you for what there is in store of madness to come.\r\nUnlike the opening, the ending theme song was very light on the heart, both on the audio and the visuals, complimented by the characters in their past lives when everything was still okay. I can't say much about the soundtrack as I am all focusing on the blood animations, I could have sworn I canceled all other senses just to power up my sight and get the most out of those fluid animations. The voice acting was decent, talking about the SUB version here, I didn't enjoy the main character's high pitched voice that much, to be honest.\n\r\n- Character (6.5/10):\r\nI thought for the longest time that Yuki from Mirai Nikki is holding the title of the most annoying main character, but I guess that Ganta might steal that away from him, the guy literally is made to annoy the freaks out of you. Making immature wrong decisions all of the time, and never learns from his mistakes, acts always like he's the one in the right path and keeps mumbling some talk-no-jutsu black magic while being the most hypocrite figure on the show. And the list keeps on going filled with forgettable characters except for one cool guy called Crow, he sure got his ssslices (yes, that's how it's spelled) on point.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI would be frank here, I had to pause the series midway for some in real life reasons, and I haven't resumed the watch until a month later, and to make it even harsh on the show, the first 6 episodes weren't all that exciting for me that I was going to give up on the series and give it a 5 or lower, but I feel like the last half had some improvements over the first one. It really took its time to introduced major characters, 4 episodes left to the end and tons of questions were still unanswered.\n\r\n- Overall (7.1/10):\r\nNot my proudest recommendation. Before watching it for myself, the title of the show always gave me shivers of badassery and excitement to see the actual anime, but it didn't turn up the way I imagined it to be, in fact, it wasn't even close. However, that doesn't make it entirely a bad show, I enjoyed what there was for me to enjoy. Do I want a sequel? absolutely, and as I've said, the general idea of the plot sounds very cool, and I'd like to see a better remake or a deserving sequel that makes up for this, a lot say the Manga is better, and that brings some hope.\n"

            "content": "\n                It was probably all started when One Punch Man was the shit back in the day when it became so mainstream that all of our favorite celebrities unleashed their inner weeb and expressed how well received it was, and since it finished airing, a new yet familiar kid entered the hood, a kid nobody hinted at nor expected, but everybody ended up welcoming him nonetheless, enter Mob Psycho 100.\r\nThe series that we were blessed with and got so lucky as to receive two fantastic adaptations in between both seasons of One Punch Man, for many of us who thought that they would stick to MobPsycho 100 as sort of a drug to help ease the wait for the long wanted second season of One Punch Man, but when nobody noticed it, we were already so invested that it becomes that one favorite series that we hate to remember the motive we had to get into it in the first place.\r\nFrom the same author of One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, especially with it's off the chart new season blew all expectations and originated its own distinguished identity in the fandom, getting a cult following after a successful season, and to add to the spiciness, it was all well deserved.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nWe all know what to expect here, just the first season, it starts off very episodic with several self-contained mini stories that do contribute to the main story, suddenly moving to arcs that span two to three episodes until it's time for the fleshed out dude with all the messy details and the built up hype of the season, the one we conclude the series with and probably, hopefully, gets expanded on with another yet upcoming season (season 3 please).\r\nWell, it is definitely a generic formula that does work and delivers what it promises, it's by no means revolutionary or specific to the franchise, but this season, in particular, had something different about it, something that speaks to the viewer and involves him or her emotionally to relate to the portrayed moment, be it sad and devastating or bittersweet.\r\nWill a lot of these mini-arcs that debuted from the very first episode, we see an occurring theme that surrounds Mob in specific, it was all in the sake of teasing Mob, pushing him around trying to get him to that stage where he snaps and is forced to face what he truly is and as we know, he is somebody that's very shy and unsocial, he gets lost in his thoughts all the time and loses his focus when surrounded by other people, very specific themes that we all can relate to with a great emphasis on friendship and family, but Mob Psycho 100 pushes it to the extra limit, to the extreme borders of drama that know no end with a great coherent with the already fast pacing of the storytelling and you get yourself a heavily moving and involving plot that keeps you asking for me, something that's rarely even to happen.\r\nAnother very well-expanded upon theme of this season is the dark nature of one's self, how much can you take in before you totally say \u201cThat's it\u201d, a simple act of plot advancement that has produced one of my favorite episodes of all time where Mob is dropped int this imaginary pessimistic world that perfectly visualizes his worse possible scenario of life where it takes place on an ultra-conflicted dimension so on point and unforgiving that he's convinced it's the life he's always lived. Saying it was one of my actual favorites of all time might just be a bit of an understatement in Mob Psycho 100's defense.\n\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nSakuga heaven, what can I say, it is very rare that I'd get the pleasure to enjoy. In other shows, it's mostly hit or miss, you could get a 10/10 animated sequence to just sublime to a terrible half-assed excused to be called an animation for the rest of the episode, saying it's more of a slideshow than animation might be an understatement, that's a big problem due to uncostintancy. A show can be both visually gorgeous and honestly consistent if either one fell victim to luckster, then it's plain hypocrisy for the sake of the show. \r\nMob Psycho 100 surprises you with fantastic animation and keeps up the same pace throughout the run without showing any signs of laziness.\r\nLet's start with the questionable art style of the show itself, while a lot of people outside of the fandom might judge it to be too simplistic or overly childish looking, well, mistern or mistress, I couldn't be more in a disagreement that my hands are itching to throw a punch at your provoking face (For legal reasons that's a joke, so be at ease, I'm not that aggressive \ud83d\ude0a).\r\nMob Psycho 100's art style speaks its beauty through its fluid animation, a simple collection of not so straight lines can be much easier to animate than a fully detailed figure of solid mad muscle that could require a week of work for one second worth of animation. Simple math boys, less work per frame means higher production quality that knows its ABC when it comes to consistency, you know when a particular Anime cuts off its usual budget and downgrades its polish details that feed the art style in favor of a short fluid animated sequence, well, Mob Psycho 100 is just that, but all the time only it's not cutting any production value to downgrade the quality of the art style it's just that, and it's awesome. And it's more apparent in still shots when the so-proclaimed heavenly animation is absent, the imagery still looks out of the world, very stylish and original, cut free from your typical art style that almost 90% of Anime follow.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nWhile I don't have anything that amazing to praise in the level of the storytelling or the visual quality that offed the charts, vocally speaking,the show doesn't suffer from any below average performances on the voice acting side, all of the actors and actresses really put on their roles like if they were clothing, portraying just the right tone of voice to compliment the character's expressions.\r\nOne thing that we can all agree on is the opening song, and we thought season one's was the shit, while it still got its glory and praise, season two's opening is just a whole other level, there is a reason why the previous one is called 99% and this one is 99.99%, the name gives it off, their superiority isn't far behind, but the hype is clearly more on point on the latter. What else is there, the soundtracks are just drugs to your ears, there is something very oddly early about them, but they give off the same energy you see those psychic wrestlers display, you could almost carry up a fully loaded fridge and run off to top Olympus on a single breath while listening to its empowering beats.\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\r\nI personally don't connect very well with the cast of the show, but I definitely get the philosophy behind Mob and Reigen, Dimple is a cool one and so is Hanazawa.\r\nDon't get me wrong, the show is full of diverse characters, from the funny goofy looking to the badass cool kid, all with different personalities and screaming threats, I can see all of them highly individually loved with the fandom.\r\nOne great re*occuring theme in the season was definitely the relationship between Mob and Reigen as a student and a master, they knew some lows in between themselves that got even us the viewer to question both individuals' motives and read through they schemes trying to decide the one in the wrong. For more than ever, Mon has finally found more spotlights to hold and show his true emotion and carrying on the redemption he always wanted to share.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nPersonally speaking, this is the show of the seasons, there were alot of other picks that kept me on the edge f my seat week to week (Yakusoku no Neverland, Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen\r\n, Domestic na Kanojo, Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari...), but never as close as Mob Psycho 100 had me rolling over the hype, or burning in sadness due to the touching episodes. To a show that I watched the first season of and really enjoyed to yet bless me with an unmeasurable amount of enjoyment once again that it definitely ranked up in my top 5 all times favorites, it can't be stretched up long enough to show my real gratitude towards it.\r\nThinking back about it, it wasn't just the breathtaking fight sequences that could be put on their own separate sub-rank of visual masterpieces, but the splendid realistic flow of event that not only produced one of my favorites episodes of all time (episode 5) but also set up a new ceiling for similar shows to follow, this was definitely a one in a several years gem that nobody should skip upon.\n\r\nOverall (9.2/10):\r\nAs if I would have never gone through the trouble of setting my friends down to watch the first season already, this gives me a greater motive to get them into it that it should be a condition that should be met have somebody requested my friendship (Nah, just kidding about the friendship thingy), I'm very proud of the show for it to get to the rating of 9 on MyAnimeList and I hope it keeps getting the attention it deserves to someday rank in the holly TOP 10 list of all times.\n"

            "content": "\n                Shounen series have taken on an eternal shell from what composes of heavy-action, battle driven power-ups, and a narrative that speaks through the overly saturated Nakama infected plot trope that has gone several generations deep into its blueprint as a genre.\r\nHowever, once in several blue moons, a new show that proclaims the name of the genre introduces itself as a faithful member of the Nakama driven plain ends up delivering on more than expected, almost transcending its identity.\r\nWhat one would call the Rick and Morty of Anime is an entirely serious and determined plot that follows up the plan is set up for right offthe bat, with a lightweight, comedy adoring manner that never fails your attention. This is not a nerdy math contest ploy, nor a boring middle-school science activity. It's a story of saving the world using science as a primary superpower.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nSightings of strange stone statues of birds have suddenly caught the attention of social media around the world, until one day, everyone on earth was suddenly petrified, indefinitely turned into stone statues of themselves without a second notice.\r\n3700 years later, one of the stone statues that shelled our protagonist was cracked, and he finally broke free.\r\nIt might seem odd that the first recorded petrification undoing was of someone that the hopes of humanity would never have a better bet for; enter Senku, a genius high schooler in the road of uncovering the mystery of the global petrification, aiming to undo the petrification and save the sleeping 7 billion lives in the process.\r\nEverything was going according to Senku's plan, the process was surely sped up after his friend Taiju broke through his petrification, but one day, after deciding on unpetrifiying a muscle-bound called Tsukasa for protection purposes, the advancement timeline introduced an unexpected turn. Shortly after, the ideals of Senku and Tsukasa started contradicting. Eventually, Senku's ideals of building a nation of science were in the way of Tsukasa's vision of a better future where the Boomers (if you will) should not be saved. A primitive war between two ideals started; even after a global reset, conflict was always the rational way to defend one's virtues.\n\r\nThe entire story linearly serializes itself, sort of like a game of Age of Empires would be. You have yourself several plans at the starting points, defining mid-breakpoints (age advancements) and a reward at the end to keep you motivated, and that brings Senku from crafting a wooden hatchet to re-inventing a light bulb. Resource gathering is always present at any given time, filling you with a sense of grind and exploration. A classic story about brains and brawn going at each other, creating many phenomenal crafts that have taken humanity millions of years to develop in no time, including the absolute galactic doctor -- Stone. That was a bad pun, but still, a clever way to title your Manga/Anime.\n\r\nThe real thrill of the story hides behind all of the mind-blowingly simplistic approaches to creating things, as facts about the first global petrification slowly unravel. Linking from pin to pin, a greater picture of the story takes a shape and form, becoming unfoggy bit by bit until the plot twists start accumulating leaving you in awes and appreciation.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThe least I can say about the art in Dr. Stone is that it was unique. Definitely a first for me, it has a weird mix between 90's Shoujo Anime and a twist on Steampunk. It feels very distinctive, especially compacted to anything else that was airing at the same time.\r\nThe only problem I find with this show on the visual level is the artistic choice of female character designs, it's debatable of course, however, there is just something about the females that almost feel as if they belong to a different series altogether when comparing them to the males. Is it the tiny months? Probably.\r\nThe background and faring landscapes make for great imagery of the setting that the story takes on, the jungles are denser, the skies are wider, clear from any sign of pollution, the wildlife looks healthy and the beaches feel endlessly vast.\n\r\n- Sound (9.5/10):\r\n\u201cOhayou Sekai good morning world\u201d. The first opening of the show sold it for me in the very first seconds. It just works, it's audibly pleasing, fun, and exciting. The second opening pales in comparison but still goes for a different vibe of itself. Both the ending songs are just as good, and the soundtrack is glorious, they blend well with the atmosphere and the primitive setting. I could be playing Age of Empires I or II, bobbing my head to the beat and enjoying the science show. Let me add that the melody on the title screens is amazing.\r\nThe voice acting feels so strangely wholesome, matching the fun tone of the show, sparkling with joy and passion. Asagiri's voice is probably my favorite, there is something very twisted yet so innocent with his performance, truely matches a mentalist with his status.\n\r\n- Characters (8.5/10):\r\nFor a show about science, the real start is the science itself, but it couldn't have been achieved without a capable group of devoted, hard-working people.\r\nSenku is a mastermind, he's a great example of an interesting and involving main character, a Shounen protagonist that is not dumb at the slightest or plays as so, in fact, quite the contrary, blowing minds with his intelligence and attentive ability to dissect, plan, and work ahead common problems. Asagiri springs malice at first, only to turn out he's a friendly one to keep, a soda lover, and a faithful ally. The rest of the cast follow in the same footsteps.\r\nTsukasa is a striking example of an intimidating villain that's proportionally scaled in terms of power. He can't blast mountain, but he can surely mess up your spine with a forceful pinch. The kind of raw physical power that can only be ruled under a strong non-primitive weapon. Embodying the very great foe that a science mind can have.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI was never the guy to pay attention in science classes, the math formulas and the dazzling amount of variables present at each time have always spun my focus aggressively, having me stare at the voice, wonder in thoughts, and do anything but pay attention to what's being said by the science teacher. Dr. Stone in the other hand stripped all of that complication process and turned it into a fun and engaging experience, something very simple to follow and be attentive to and extremely rewarding. It made me appreciate how far science has gone, and how much do we take it for granted. Having me week to week at the edge of my seat, it balances its humor and serious plot building to the max, so you never feel it's dragged out or too fast-paced for the largest portion of its run.\n\r\n- Overall (9/10):\r\nDr. Stone is a breeze of fresh air that we only get to experience once in a while in the Shounen game. It embraces its genre very well, making you feel at home with all the clich\u00e9 Shounen you could ever ask for, while in the same breath serving a different kind of sensation in the way it handles itself. It takes itself seriously, and respects the risks it introduces, and remains an enjoyable ride, filled with the same amount of hype and enthusiast sets up at the start. Science buff or not, prepare for a circus of science spectacle that for a change doesn't feel like a tiring sleepover session for a lot of folks.\n"

What kept the scenes going were the erotic voice acting that makes the short closer to being a hentai if you were to close your eyes and imagine stuff based on what you hear.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nI like that they went ahead and included pretty much every major girl in the series, specifically a woman we never thought we needed, Grayfia, Lucifer's wife, oh boy, just what we were missing from the parent series.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nIt was an okay experience, had some giggles, the fanservice was so intense that you wouldn't want somebody to catch you watching it, you'd rather sacrifice being seen watching twitch THOTs than this.\n\r\n- Overall (6.4/10):\r\nIf you're a fan of fanservice, and most of us are, this is differently something you'd want to see, although, not as good as the previous short series, it differently sets off the tone after the intense events of the third season.\n"

            "content": "\n                Without a proper context, unintentionally, we would lean on to the side of the party with the lower risks and more relatable mostly due to our \u201chuman\u201d nature, a bunch of dancing silhouettes in the distance screaming a bunch of sounds dancing on what looks like an abused hardly recognizable corps while they keep standing the helpless almost decomposed carcass in joy, now that's horrible group of barbaric savages coming one of their holy sacrifices. But what if the dead corpse was of a vicious witch, one that has haunted this poor village for decades, kidnapping little kids and sneaking in the villages late atnight snapping their necks for whatever dark-magic reason it is, they have finally hunted her after so much loss and are celebrating this great cleansing as both the end to a terrifying past and the beginning of a peaceful life at last.\r\nBut then again, there is no guarantee that the villages are just too blinded with the laughable beliefs that led them to kidnap a stranger out of their trib and performed all sorts of terrible doings on their corps after lengthy hours of torture for whatever fetish it was they were trying to satisfy. Who's the real demon now? Is appearance worthy to tell apart? That last statement couldn't be a fraction of the truth for how much hatred came from discriminating against a group of people that are the exact same as the abuser, only with a darker tone of skin. Anyone is willing to call everybody who doesn't agree to their beliefs a demon, a pill of walking bullshit that needs to meet its end, it's horrible even saying it, let alone witnessing it being done, and you know, stuff like this is somebody's daily routine out there.\r\nMuch of this and more is the meat of \u201cDevilman: Crybaby\u201d in a furious fest of blood, rape, treason and all kinds of taboo that mocks the real world and sets off some over-exaggerated imagery on how it's done that doesn't fall apart on delivering the same kind of trauma and shock. This show doesn't hold back on its nudity nor does it slow down the pace of similar NSFW imagery the same as real life (Shocking, I know), immediate caution mode should be switched ON all time, you never know when a sharp object might stop the throbbing heart of a beloved character nor an episode that starts off on hardcore gay sex, something that messed my head in a way I never expected.\n\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nWhat started like a middle friendship contract between two innocent looking kids evolved into what nobody saw coming. Akira, a crybaby in the heart as people call him, a good-willed and a nice kid overall finally made contact with his long parted childhood friend that ended up dragging him into a world of paranormal activities as demon hunters, together, trying to eliminate them under a good intention.\r\nOf course, tragic things happen, which only steered the wheel the wrong direction and ended up in a conflict between one's will and his/her body for a search about freedom and recognition while being tied up to the disgraceful trashy abomination that society makes him/her be.\r\nAmong the strongest logs that shape up this great adaptation was the pacing, so strong it boosts your blood while you're trying not to lose your balance and fall off to the ground without even noticing.\r\nA lot of details is thrown like a minigun free spray every episode that it requires a mathematician's attention to keep up with and it's not necessarily a bad thing as it only contributes into the world building that resulted into a magnificent backstory that I want to discuss.\r\nWhat really makes this plot easier to get into, maybe at times even relatable is that the core of it is a pretty well-known thesis that especially the religious of us can agree with. The whole good and evil deeds related to Anges and Demons fight, it feels like a revamped urban legend that your grandmother would repeatedly tell you every now and then.\n\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nA lot of people would be complaining about how unappealing this show was, visually-wise. I would like to stop you right there, respectable sir or madam.\r\nI can understand how the \u201cart style\u201d can be a bit off-putting looking how this is a contribution to an older series \u201cDevilman\u201d, they clearly wanted to keep the dated look like a show for appreciation (I like this approach better than Banana Fish's), however, animation wise, this was a blast to look at.\r\nFluidity is key, it's like impossible to notice a split in a frame somewhere.\r\nIt's also worth noting that CGI is completely absent, if not, it was very good you couldn't notice it, which is the greatest thing visually speaking this show has going for it.\r\nOne complaint I have was how overly dark most of the fight scenes are, maybe the demons can see perfectly due to their eyes, but not for most of us, I had to repeatedly increase the lighting and adjust the screen's hue to keep up with their silhouette.\n\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nMy ears would like to personally thank the team that was after the vocals.\r\nThe voice acting was phenomenal, and as it involved some English spoken lines, the cast was up for the job, I didna have to cringe any bit as I was a completely normal hearing to solidly spoken English that you'd swear they substituted the voice actor for that portion just in the right time for you not to notice until the dialogue shifts back to Japanese in a seamless way that just had me accept how talented the voice actors and actresses were.\r\nThey also did the more emotional scenes perfectly to how the tone of the voice matched the expression of the character's faces, there was a middle resonance there that leads you to believe the cast was being exposed to some horrible things while recording just to make sure they right tone is led out.\r\nThe opening and ending songs were very simple, it didn't shift the focus of the episode either starting or ending, very quick and undistracting, neither loud ot quite, just in the right volume to keep your excited for what the content of the episode is going to be. Much like a jump scare warning.\r\nThe soundtrack is probably the best thing this show excels at doing the most, a bunch of messy noises that are magically juxtaposed just the right way to give you the extra eargasm at every action sequence and equally dread you to pieces on emotional moments. And obviously, I can't stop here and forget about the greatness of the rap tracks we got to hear from several characters on the run as they were speaking truer lines on the reality they were living than what's broadcasted on television, it makes you want an 8-miles like movie surrounding them.\n\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nThis is a really heated topic when it comes to this show as it's pretty much a hit or miss situation. Concerning the cast, it's rich and varying alright, I loved so many characters from different backgrounds and with different ideologies, but most of it comes from empathy, most of them weren't that likable at the start of the series, maybe not even noticeable, but then a great development happens and BOOM.\r\nI'm going to have to spit off some MAJOR end-game spoilers from now and then, so if you want to keep it spoiler free, jump to the following section and skip over this upcoming paragraph.\r\nA lot of sacrifices were made, you'd start the series cheering for somebody, almost sure they would survive until the death mark hits them harder than you can blink. But to what extent? Just to advance the development of the main character by a microscopic margin, it was not worth it considering the high stakes.\n\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI could barely make it out of the show, once you've seen it, it's hard to erase it from your mind, and I'm sure I'm hainvg thoughts about this show for the next couple of weeks for how deep and involving it got me one my two sessions binge watch, which is what probably gave me most of the satisfaction, I can't imagine how hard it was for people to wait a whole week after every cliffhanger episode, I laughed, I burnt in anger, I almost cried, it was one hell of a sabbath party on its own for me.\n\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\n\u201cDevilman: Crybaby\u201d is one of those shows that we only get to see once or twice every lengthy period of time, it's not shy to address most embarrassing social problems that don't get talked about that too often.\r\nSomething that's very wanted from most of the battle shows is the involving pacing, here you'll feel home as it doesn't wast a split of a second of something non-plot boosting, full time non-stop action sequences, heartbreaking moments that keep you on the edge of your seat all of the episode. I can't recommend this hard enough as it has so much to it that I can list although the art style might be off-putting for some people, it's one experience that you won't get in most other shows. Just make sure you're all set for a 10 episode non-stop action, and keep into consideration the large scale of NSTW material that's get thrown into the screen like a lot, we're talking rape scenes passionate sex, gore, and graphic nudity.\n"

            "content": "\n                After seeing the first season, my immediate reaction was, \u201cthat's it?\u201d, I heard tons of praise and shootouts to this show but it didn't live up to nearly what it was hyped up to be for me, perhaps that's my problem for not caring for Basketball, to begin with, but then I watched the second season and it finally clicked.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nOne of the first season's biggest problems was highlighting the focus of the plot. Sure we were introduced to the rivalry at hand, set up a tournament that would span 3 seasons, but the in-between team member drama and progression were kind of left out.The characters seemed like they had a story to tell, but their voices were never heard.\r\nWith this second season, after Seirin trained hard for the entirety of the first season, finally getting the big fishes. Kuroko has seen massive growth and has had several backstories explaining his relationship with various members of the Generation of Miracles. Kagami too has finally hit the right strings, with a personal backstory that finally made sense, it set up where he was coming from and explained the motives that drove him in both seasons and onwards. The pacing was good, it could have been much better, I hoped the season would have had more games to focus on though.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nThey had me balling my eyes on this one. The first season had a fine art direction, with animation spiking only at the crucial moments and this one followed on the same principle, however, it had a lot of epic and movie-quality-animation worthy moments that get you screaming, \u201cget me a Basketball Goddamnit\u201d. Again, it fed off of the common sports Anime trope where the screen would be spammed with countless shocked reaction faces, but when they call is made, you can almost see blood pumping from the players' veins, the sweat drops beautifully reacting and the fluid moves that transition like an elegant dance.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nI would say that the first season is still crowned for its amazing first opening and good second, however, this season has its fair share of epic openings. The animation though on the first opening sequence surpasses anything else in the franchise, as far as the song goes, not so much. The second ending song, however, is the best of the best.\r\nThe voice acting was good I guess, nothing more notable. The OST was banging though. I wish they kept the suspense track from the first season's recap.\n\r\nCharacters (8.4/10):\r\nDefinitely a step up in every direction. Everything I complained about previously seemed to have been addressed in this season. Kuroko, for example, moves from being this static passing-tool to someone that fights and sweats for his team to the last drop. And Kagami from a thick-headed rushing-storm to a more down to the earth team player.\r\nI wish Kise would have had more screentime but it seems as the first season focused heavily on him and Midorima, this one delves to expand and introduce on Aomine and Murasakibara which are both great rivals and antagonists in a way.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI feel like season 2 was definitely the climax that the first season was setting up to. It was totally worth the grind through the first 24 episodes even for the people that didn't enjoy it as much as they thought they would. I adored Seirin even more, the dynamic between the members and Kuroko with the other Generation of Miracles member. I loved the concept of the Zone and the two last games were just out of this world.\n\r\nOverall (8.28/10):\r\nI would say, even to my past self, this is more than the first season alludes to. It is a tier above even its predecessor, definitely that one sequel that carries everything before it.\n"

            "content": "\n                Oh look, it's that show where the fat guy works himself up to get revenge on that one girl who rejected him on his child-days, feels old yet?\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge OVA, as obvious as it sounds is an OVA for the parent series with the same name minus the last 3 (or 4 including the space character) characters is yet another peek at the daily lives of the portrayed cast. This is not a sequel or a prequel but rather just extra content that you may insert at some point from watching the series, so the order doesn't really matter that much, at least watchthis after the beach episodes. Masamune-kun no Revenge was a series that hasn't aged well in my memory aside from its plot idea of revenge, I couldn't recall any character names or chronological order to keep up along, but it didn't stop me from enjoying this short.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nThe OVA follows three different stories with different contexts resolving around friends and family.\r\nThe first was looking at Masamune meeting his Aunt that looks exactly like his loli mother, and that has a daughter that's just as prominent as her. The trio goes as far as annoying the heck out of the protagonist giving him a hard time telling them apart.\r\nThen came the second snapshot that focused on his female classmates going on a beach vacation without him, having fun at the beach, trying swimsuits (there is always room for fanservice) and doing some girly stuff.\r\nThe third and the last was, in my opinion, the most deserving out of the bunch, it follows Yoshino probably for the first time dressing and having a princess makeup, she goes through a monologue for the most part on why she feels so empty and lonely most of the time.\r\nThose where some pretty basic side stories to get to know the characters more, probably setting up for a near sequel.\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\r\nI've never had problems with the art in this franchise, the girls look cute, the anatomy isn't dragged on and the movements feel normal.\r\nI like the details the put on the characters' eyes, they give way more personality to them and even back up the statement \u201cThe eyes are mirrors of the soul\u201d pretty well. The use of vibrant colors is never disappointing if used right.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nI never lose it when talking about sound acting in shows like this, the more pitches a loli voice gets the more transparent it becomes to me to take seriously. The only thing I really feel nostalgic about is the opening theme song, I don't know why the ending one never clicked to me though.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nIt was nice to see a buildup for characters, especially Yushino, they all feel like they went through a massive change from what I can remember, it's stories like these that level up characters, giving us their motives really helps. But then again, the cast is not a small one, and not everybody is having the same treatment, I'd say at most it's always Masamune, Aki, and Yoshino.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nThe ride was all... Meh. I didn't expect more to be honest, but it was enough to stop me from sighing from boredom. I don't consider myself as a hardcore fan of the series, or even the genre, but I still had a catch from watching this, and I only expect people that like this sort of stuff to love this, but still it's not mandatory to see. The shorts do not contribute to the main plot so it all feels like a select of fillers disguised under a 23 minutes OVA.\n\r\n- Overall (6.9/10):\r\nI don't see this aging any better than the main franchise, I feel like the trend has toned down quite a bit so this might not be as prominent as it may have been a year ago. I nonetheless had my share of swimsuit sighting for the day, so I beg your pardon.\n"

Long story short, this was nothing worth the watch at all,it was just one train wreck that didn't know what to focus on, the Sunny introduction, the Toriko teases, the movie's production glimpse, kind of?!

            "content": "\n                You don't always stumble across Anime like this one, you want to settle for a one-off gag show and move on to something else but end up getting more than you were waiting for. The gags are there, they have a strong drive and present on the plot's progression, but there is also a character than came to stay, \u201ccool\u201d, \u201ccooler\u201d, \u201ccoolest\u201d, as the narrator says, let me add to that, \u201ccooliest\u201d. If that word isn't on the dictionary then Sakamoto has it already reserved, and this show says why that is.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nIf you're coming at the show as a challenge to your connoisseurtaste in storytelling, don't expect anything else, as the norm has it, gags are just there as comic relief that fills up boring padding in the story and lights up the atmosphere if needed, but here it's a stable of the plot, something that alters it at a moment's notice all for the sake of a coherent progression.\r\nThe pacing of the show varies from mini-arc to another, each episode features at least two different skits show why Sakamoto is a cool as he is, solidifying his personality and immortalizing it in your head, but that could also be due to that popular \u201ctheory\u201d that I'm not a big subscriber of but it does make sense by the end of the show.\n\r\nThis is a comedy standup that draws you in with how funny and light-hearted it is while discussing some real-world problems that everyone can relate to. Loneliness, Being bullied, Unaquired love, all are gently tackled by Sakamoto in the coolest way until the show ends up on a bittersweet note that both contradicts and emphasizes the wholesomeness that floating around the show.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThis one was weird. A close mix of 90's Shojo and modern trash Shounen, the characters change styles according to the circumstance which is a great plus. The backgrounds are nothing special given the setting of the story, so no nitpick from that part. A proper way to put it, good enough to keep you watching.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nWhen it came to voice acting, it wasn't the strongest point of the Anime. Aside from Sakamoto who's voice was luxury to get to hear, the rest of the cast was decent, no bad performance or anything, just decent on the grander scale of things. The openings and endings, however, were bangers and the OST is so memorable and classy it fits perfectly.\n\r\n- Characters (9/10):\r\nThis is probably the best thing about this show. Gag series should really focus more on its characters, they are the means the show delivers its jokes, they are the vessel that carries the dialog, and Sakamoto desu ga nails that aspect perfectly. Sakamoto is a genuinely likable character starting from the very first second he's introduced at. He's calm, daring, and cool, he affects the story on a great scale just like what a protagonist following the book should. The supporting cast is amazing, both the friend and the foe, they fulfill their roles in the most suitable way making you both love and hate them according to the situation. I can't find a single character to hate for the sake of being a badly written character, not even Fukase. congratulations on your graduation by the way.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nWhat a sit-through. I'm glad I haven't bloated through this series in a single sitting, I feel like an idol such as Sakamoto is the kind of character you need to see and hear from on a daily basis with proper breaks in between, the relationship you end up having with this fictional character is only clearly visible when you realize you're at the last 3 minutes of the series. God, I'm going to miss this show.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nI came in for \u201cyour perfect merry-sue of your highschool\u201d gag and came out as a follower of the Sakamoto cult, this show works wonders. Some individual skits have the potential to branch off in, to their own separate series, that's how good some of the skits were. It gets extremely wholesome and funny sometimes but some other times you are hit with the hardest ball of feels that you never see coming, it's how unpredictable it is what makes most of this show. There are so many comedy Anime out there, but there is only one and only Sakamoto.\n"

            "content": "\n                I usually start out my reviews by laying down a proper introduction, probably stating some facts or presenting a background on the reviewed show, but I feel like in Dead Leaves's case I should mention something else first. Please note that the R+ rating is not just sitting there, so if you're younger than you're supposed to be, do not attempt to watch this, this might sound very polite for the age, or maybe too optimistic for me to think that people would go by my advice and call off their planned watch, believe me, you don't want to sacrifice your numbered days of innocenceon something so simple. For the people who don't like extreme adult content, this is a definitive pass. We're talking partial nudity, curse words, genitalia references, live sex, and more badass (this is not a smoking promotion, DO NOT SMOKE), people chewing cigarettes.\r\nFor some unfamiliar newcomers, you might be stepping into the weird territory, so if you're more familiar/comfortable with mainstream shows like the fate series, this one is by no means similar, not in the storytelling, art style, or choice of music, I'm trying as hard to phrase this review in a manner that doesn't scare people away because it's always good to appreciate both the mainstream, underrated, and weird anime junk, and sometimes gems can be found deep under the pills of stinking trash, you just have to throw the rode and hope for a big catch, and that's what I did until I hit my head into this obscure hyperactive Emerald, wait, I think it's still too early to call it that, let's decide at the end of the review.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nDead Leaves, released early 2004 shares a lot with the shows of the era, with a basic and very simplistic (semi-futuristic) story that can be made on the fly by any 10 years old kid with as much pop culture references on his/her head as he/she can fit, but not everything made by 10 year olds is a hoax, today's kids of that same age are hosting science conferences and taking it like a sweet lollipop, and the \u201cpop\u201d in there was no accident.\r\nWoke up on planet earth, Retro a guy with a yellow 80's TV for a head, and a sexy stereotypical hip of the era, both naked and with no memories, more clueless than the folks in \u201cThe Hangover\u201d series get sent to a special jail called \u201cDead Leaves\u201d residing on the last crispy piece left of the moon after they caused some major GTA-like chaos. The twist being that Dead Leaves is a private experimentation facility disguised as a prison that runs mutation tests in order to create strong mutants and sell them to the army. And now it's to our protagonists to lead on one of the craziest prison breaks out there.\r\nThe story follows a pretty linear storytelling board with extremely limited flashbacks consisted of few still images that flash faster than a lazy douche's blink. It remains very fast paced throughout the whole 50-ish minutes, all action, that keeps on going non-stop. This could be one major action game commercial with so many killstreaks than Ninja and Ali-A combined using the most sophisticated hacks there are. *insert Ali-A's distorted intro here*.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nNo exaggeration here, this was one of the most original art styles I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. If I had to put it all on one word it would be \u201cWacky\u201d. This is very different than the traditional Anime art styles you get to see more often, it's closer to being cartoony, like that childhood show \u201cEd, Edd, and Eddy\u201d, it looks very 80's in nature and contains the theme it presents wonderfully. The use of vibrant colors was only the tip of the iceberg, especially focusing on the yellow tint the most as there are more explosions here than what \u201cThe Slow Mo Guys\u201d can fit in their channel for 20 years. The shotting is just so crazy with the wacky camera angles and constant shaking and movements, I could almost swear they had the cameraman/camerawoman twerk with the camera being attached to his/her butt, but it didn't look any less cool.\r\nThe movie really left me hungry for more similar animation works, I hope there are more of this kind, it just works so well. For such an action centered movie, the colors and animation really made it look and feel more energetic and fun, it's almost as having a really sweet dream that you don't want to wake up from.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nAs if the visuals weren't stunning and superactive on their own, the music only made the action more intense and engaging it made me wanna launch a first-person shooter game and go on a killstreak, I can never get enough of that base dropping. If our dreams had soundtracks, this movie should make us a favor and smack our ear drums off, cause that shit will make you pull off dance moves while asleep.\r\nThe voice acting was also well fit in the characters, it was so well paced too that the sex scenes didn't feel a bit cringy or not in place. And remember, put on some headphones or lower the voice while watching, you never know who might hear the moaning behind those walls.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nTalking about Comedy, the characters were funny not only personality-wise, but also physically. And I thought One Piece had some of the greatest wacky character designs (still love the shit out of them though), Dead Leaves took this to a whole other level. And seeing how it took a very cartoonish style of animation, it made it a lot easier to go overboard and explore new stuff. I mean there is a zombie figure guy that has a drill for a penis, and it's functional as well. The protagonist Retro (Usopp's voice actor in One Piece) as well is a very likable person, and Pandy as well. Both are very sexual characters but with more personality than lust, that's right Retro, restrain yourself. I also took a liking to side characters, something that's rarely ever to happen seeing how most shows put more emphasis on the protagonists and leave the sidekicks out of the spotlights.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nDead Leaves is to be a movie like no other, not the best I've seen for sure but managed to go beyond my expectations. Now, I'm one to check the hour every now and then as I watched my shows, wanting the ordeal to end to move to the next task, but not with Dead Leaves, my eyeballs almost popped out, like a kid staring at that very sweet lollipop at a candy store, for me at least, this is a definitive annual rewatch for now on. This whole ride was like going to an amusement park at age 5 and getting to try out everything that you want, why wouldn't you come back more occasionally, right?\r\nIt's always good for us adults too to get to feel that kid feeling that we have and have always restrained, bringing the child in all of us can be a blast, we must never betray our childish side.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nNot everybody has the same interests and tastes and take my word in this. For action fans, this is a very close one to being a must-see, just be tolerant of the art style as it's very rare to see something like this. This is one of those movies that you would want to see with close friends while having something to drink, like a power drink or soda for how much dirty jokes gets spilled all over the place.\n"

The crude and bland view it influences is the furthest away from being pleasant, and drawing any enjoyment from it is also a sign of mental incapability and social inferiority. is not only nightmare hunting. That is the image people want you to think about Sword Art Online as a whole, probably the biggest factor of me diving in with absolutely zero expectations, well, love it or hate it, SAO is none ofthe above. Ask the haters, they will say otherwise and ask the fans, they will say; \u201cDo you mean SAO II\u201d?\r\nWeird how even in one of the most controversial Anime shows, there is an even more controversial sequel that both the fans and the haters agree on it being straight-up bad. But hey, it's a matter of taste, and taste is very subjective.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nPeople will complain, why is it even called SAO when the plot is hardly about the game SAO anymore, Well, SAO is still very much present in both concept and physical way. The VRMMORPJ trend that started with SAO is still very much strong and present, not only that but pretty much every other trendy game is built up upon The Seed, a fragment from SAO's core.\n\r\nI would get it over with here and now, both arcs from the first season were miles better than anything showcased in SAO II. With that said, aside from the side story episode \u201cCalibur\u201d, SAO II has a decent standing in that regard, averagely mediocre, yes, but they do build upon what the first season ended up on and also expand on the world and the SAO lore.\n\r\nThe first arc, the \u201cPhantom Bullet\u201d was a very sudden and fast switch from close combat centered conflicts to fast-paced ranged battles where in theory, Kirito is at a great disadvantage, but hey, protagonist power boost, so let's just ignore that. I'm going to say, the massive switch in settings was a refreshing new perspective that I never asked for, but enjoyed every moment of. You'd think that SAO would have lost a great deal of what makes it itself, turned out the in-characters drama, and plot mysteries is what carried both seasons all along.\r\nThe plot of this first arc really relates to the Aincrad arc, it brings back the past and makes Kirito run on his toes all the time and upping up the stakes. It is yet a thrilling life and death situation, we really missed that on the Fairy Dance arc.\n\r\nRight after, a confusingly placed mini-arc that kind of lets the plot take a breather by following the cast on an ALO quest to retrieving the legendary Excalibur, it really shows the hustle that Kirito spoke off when he was able to summon it against the rapist villain from the Fairy Dance arc. It felt a little bit slow and more of a chore to follow, but thankfully, it was a short one.\n\r\nFinally, the concluding arc, \u201cMother's Rosario\u201d. Now, let me start by stating, I'm a grown man, and it's been years since an Anime was this close to making tear up, but damn it, that was a blurry, watery vision for at least 2 minutes.\r\nThe first and proper arc to focus on Asuna, a lot of development from hers, getting to see more of her perspective and her relationship with her family, it was a nice change from the Kirito-Sugo dosage.\r\nA very depressing arc with an amazing resolution that really makes you think.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nOn the visual level, SAO II hardly made any improvements if at all, even looking at the 2 years gap and the massive popularity of the series.\r\nWith that said, we do get some fleshed peasing animation on the big fights and important moments. The expressions are very sold-out and nailed at times, the color palettes are amazingly matched, as we see in the colorful ALO and the dim and dusty GGO.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nLet's talk openings and endings, I guess it's a stable now, one of the strongest aspects of the series thus far, they never fail to deliver on the quality of the vocals in that regard. The endings though are a bit of a grower.\r\nThe voice acting was fantastic, especially with Asuna for how massive of a spectacle she had.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nI've praised the character aspect all the way to now, I really liked Kirito's struggle during the Phantom Bullet arc, it really added a lot to what he accomplished and show off his growth, but the real star of the season is really Asuna, I did not expect the show to focus on anybody to that degree that does not fall under the name Kirito, but hey, I was easily at home in that regard. The fact that Asuna started, for me at least, as just another female support character to possibly a better, more fleshed out character than Kirito himself says a lot about her arc.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nDue to the slightly slow pacing of the season, it really hurt the experience a notch, it definitely dragged out on many occasions, but the thrill was always there. So far, SAO has been hitting close to home in both seasons, but this one, although not as great as the first one, it definitely felt friendlier and easier to follow, perhaps, all thanks to the first season for making us familiar with the characters and more aware of their world, but it goes without saying.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nI guess, if you already made it through the first season, what's stopping you from jumping ion this one? You don't have to start from scratch, although, you do get thrown into an entirely different game with different rules and different stakes.\r\nIf you're more of a character guy as well, you'll be right at home as well, Asuna, Kirito, and some other new faces do make out the cut and show off a new side of themselves.\n"

In many cases, especially for \u201ccompletionists\u201d like myself, whenever there is a piece of related animation to some show you watched, you just have to pull up an effort and dedicate some time to watch it, no matter how bad it might be, so most of the time it starts off with heavy sighs and brush down attitude, but not with this one.\n\r\nFor an ONA, it has to be one of if not thebest I've seen. The animation is crisp, out of an official release. The voice acting is on point, and the direction looks like some limited accessed full-blown budget that you'd think they would have included in the parent show, for 8 episodes 5 minutes long each, that would make a splendid 2 episodes that I'm sure nobody would have complained about.\n\r\nOf course, nobody in class E was ever neglected in the general context of the story, and you can even see that cleared with this ONA, as it goes on focus over some debatably minor characters, and not suck on the money bag trio that is Nagisa, Karma, and Kaede.\n\r\nRelatively short and very fun and conclusive, it follows the same formula of its parent show where every episode is a mix between and sequential and episodic layout, it doesn't feel strange on the fans for that matter.\n"

            "content": "\n                Disclaimer: minor spoilers below!!\n\r\nI was hesitant to jump into this movie trilogy, part of it is coming from fear. Fear that it might not deliver on the Psycho-Pass hype I was accumulating for all of these years, but in the end, it came back to it. I watched the first SS Case, it was average I'd say, and then I watched the second one, which succeeded in reassuring me. The final torch was handed to the third and last movie, I wanted it to be good, I wanted it to be more than just the last one, and fortunately, it surpassed even my expectations.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nThemovie at hand is both a sequel to the last movie, but even more so, a direct sequel to the first Psycho-Pass movie \u201cPsycho-Pass: The Movie\u201d that follows Kougami in his journey that covers how he sets up his fourth coming into the third season. And mind you, I haven't seen the third season yet, but it's a telling from the conclusion of this movie.\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of the prequel, the plot is very action-based, it's motivated by the overdramatic shooting, epic drone battles and of course, the fascinating hand to hand combat.\r\nAlthough perhaps the whole movie was pushing the franchise to hopefully go back to its roots, that is, a mystery detective thriller, it did so little of that than meets the eye.\n\r\nArt (9.2/10):\r\nThe visuals in this one, oh my God.\r\nI thought the last one improved on that from the first SS case movie, but this one just blows everything out of the water. I can't believe I'm praising CGI now, the way those bags were swinging in the raging winds of the Himalaya looked so eye batting. The colors were vibrant, I mean, it's India we're talking about here and the characters were poping, you can easily distinguish them from the yet gorgeous backgrounds with no problems.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nMore Kougami = more music to the ear.\r\nSome people forget why Kougami is so good, it's not just because he is a well-written character, but also the seiyuu behind him does such an incredible job at conveying the dialogs he part-takes in.\r\nAgain, with the first opening theme song, it's just so good, I keep burning in nostalgia as soon as the first note hits me. And of course, the OSTs, adding even more delicious topping to an already delicious cake.\n\r\nCharacter (8.5/10):\r\nI guess you know it already, the fan-favorite Kougami takes the stage, what else? Character-wise, this was a fan service fest that everybody loved. The setting that focused on linking Kougami back to the main plotline added some restrictions of any attempts at character development, but you could argue that him deciding to go back home at the end is development in on itself.\r\nThe main villain I'd argue was the weakest character in this movie; he didn't really manage to catch you and have you notice him much, in fact, some lesser impactful characters easily took off his highlight for themselves.\r\nFrederica, in the last movie, struck me with a fishy unwelcoming attire, you could tell something about her was just dangerous and unlikeable, however, surprisingly enough, this movie flips that upside down without any warning.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nGreat movie. I did not expect much but I was proven wrong, and I like when that happens, I guess more budget was thrown into this project than the other two for a reason.\r\nI really enjoyed this one, it felt like an unreleased portion of the very first Psycho-Pass movie that we're finally getting to see. \r\nI enjoyed the whole sit through, it felt like a standard Anime episode whilst in reality spanning over an hour, ending up on the perfect note with enough hype and excitement for the third season.\n\r\nOverall (8.64/10):\r\nWatch it. Seriously, even if you have to skip the first two movies, which I still think are great on their own, especially the second one, this one however just blows them out of the water.\r\nIf you're a Psycho-Pass fan, check. If you love your crispy animation, super check. If you love your Kougami, I mean, watch it, jus- just watch it.\n"

And it's been over 20 years as of now, and it's still going strong if not stronger than ever.\r\nBut let's go back in time, back, back... back, before the story had an Anime adaptation. Part of a tour of short animations, a certain piece of animation made it an entry under the name \u201cOne Piece: Taose! Kaizoku Ganzack\u201d, and I'm sure that even then, a lot of people ended up sleeping on its truepotential to flourish, and look at it now. Brighter than ever.\n\r\nOk, let's get it out of the way, the animation, for something from the 90s, you can easily get a fuzzy picture on what it would look like on your head, that's probably why I was surprised the most, of course, not because of the out-of-nowhere insane high resolution of the time (and it had none of that), but mainly because of the satisfactory fluid animation that spans almost the entirety of the OVA continuously, something even early Toei One Piece never scaled up to.\n\r\nThe main cast, composed of Luffy, Zoro, and Nami, making it the story fit somewhere in between of Orange Town and Syrup Village arcs, Nami is as betraying as ever, Luffy just as goofy and glutton as they come, and Zoro as infamous and widely recognizable as he's always been. The trio got themselves involved into saving an island that was overrun by pirates, and to be honest, it was as generic of a setup as the classic One Piece we're grown to love.\r\nDock into an island or be forced to land on it, make a move on the villain, get captured, escape death, learn about the story of the island, head back for a second round, beat the bad guy, set to sea for more information. Grindy but effective.\n\r\nAs I was waiting for One Piece episode 884 to download (slow internet), it was a great deal of time for until then, I'm sure it's going to be weird shifting between a pre-One Piece adventure to the intense events of the Levely arc, but for what it is, it sure made for a good watch.\n\r\nOverall score: (6.8/10)\n"

Akito came just in time to offer even more of an expansion on the world that surrounded the main story.\n\r\nI dove in almost blind, which was surprising for me when I found out that Lelouch is probably not going to take part in any of those, but who knows, he may make a cameo appearance, and God, please let that happen, along with a few if not all of the major characters from the parent series. If I understand correctly, this is set in the time frame that took place in between season 1 and season 2. Lelouch is probably now held captive, and thus, Akito an Eleven that sparks Lelouch and Suzaku vibes is taking the main lead. Along with his commander Leila (A Britanian aristocrat), and a few other Eleven.\r\nWithout putting too many credits on Akito, he does not scale to the complexity that both Lelouch and Suzaku display, but it's also worth noting that this is one the first entry out of 5 movies in total, so it might be still too early to judge his character indefinitely.\n\r\nThe action that made a great part of Code Geass was present, luckily. I forgot how fast-paced and intense the fights were. It's so blooded thrilling to see an exchange of raw mecha punches, gigantic swords waving left and right, and bursts of lethal firearms that hit at all directions. And even when the pilots leave off their nightmares, they can certainly impress with they fast and precise hand-to-hand combat mastery. It's very safe to say that this movie does not disappoint from an Animation stand of point.\n\r\nThe music was also good, the voice acting left nothing to be desired, you know something is good and working as it should when you don't feel the need to bash on it. While not phenomenal, it delivered an enjoyable deal of vocal fun. That was a weird way to phrase it.\n\r\nDefinitely excited to see more of this. Of course, it's not yet on the level of the parent show, but it could go either way, it's still only an opening for a greater plot, and I shall only see for myself when it all ends.\n"

Before being released, I was eagre, just like every other mini spin-off series to see what it could hold off to; the same deal I did with the Attack on Titan shorts back in the day. The art style screams of comedy packaged into a wholesome and lightweight delivery, clinging to what Black Clover offers from oneliners to self-aware, self-centered jokes that the fans always say about the series; Asta's driven megaphone screaming, Yuno's limited dialog, and Noelle's obsession of asserting her royalty.\r\nThe shorts fall under a surprisingly serializing plot that carries on episode after the other, with Sally,or Shadow-cloaked Sally playing the villain, fueling conflict between the Demon skull and The Black Bulls. Did I forget to mention Cyborgs? Yes, there is even a classic Sentai Mecha theme going on, one I never asked for, but even satisfied part of my fantasies created from that one Docking scene from One Piece.\n"

            "content": "\n                My god was that a ride to remember, no really, if anything, these movies were written by Oda are the most I've ever seen in the history of anime movies, like for instance, Naruto movies were not that good except for some, but in One Piece, those are shinning like Tesoro's gold on a dark night.\r\nThat was the type of movies you would expect to rewatch at least once a year, while it was slightly different from what a pirate does, it turned out to be a fantastic journey, the humor, twists, backstories, and action are all present, and let me tell you, would youget a huge treat for unique character, someone them will let you wish they were canon, but we've got to only have faith in Oda, and he will surely deliver.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nThe story of the movie has been teased long before the actual events of the movies started, and it made for heck of an amazing build up, and that had a great reward on itself, like for instance, we heard about Gran Tesoro the first time back on that filler after Dressrosa, the \u201cSliver Mine\u201d arc, it was a decent one, they kept referencing Tesoro and hyping him up as \u201cThe monster of the new world\u201d, and yes, he did live up to that reputation, and then, there was the prequel to the movie, yet another fantastic special, would really recommand it, it was called \u201cHeart of Gold\u201d, it served itself as an amazing teaser too, and then again, there was that \u201cepisode 0\u201d special about them going to Gran Tesoro, all of those animations were such a great hype up, leading to the finale, which is this movie.\r\nThe movie starts off as the straw hats arrive at Gran Tesoro, the so-called biggest entertainment city in the world, owned by someone that's not only is recognized as the biggest entertainer but also one of the top richest people that have 20% of all the world's berries, the so-called king of casinos and gambling, and to our surprise, he has quite the depressing backstory surrounding him as well.\r\nThis movie, or at least for me, is quite special, and more distinguishable than others, because, in addition to the adventure, it has an extra \u201cnew\u201d element, you get to see some big budget planning for probably one of the biggest thefts in the history of One Piece, you see the straw hats working together as burglar, going undercover, sneaking around and acting according to plane, it really has that big \u201cOcean's Eleven\u201d trilogy vibes to it, but ofcourse, there would be a lot of goofying off by the members of the crew at times, but as you should know, when it comes to action, they would break quite the havoc. The world of One Piece seems a lot more massive now that I look at it, how Gran Tesoro is a country on a ship, recognized by the world government, there must be a lot of crazy stuff out there. And the fights were so spot on, as soon as the movie starts, you get to see the straw hats showing off them moves to the public, living up to their reputation, and the matter remains throughout the movie, something else I found intreging is the existence of cars, very odd to see in One Piece, the last time I remember seeing functioning vehicles other than ships, where Ace's special boat (or whatever it's called), and Smoker's bike that run on smoke, that added a lot to the movie, to be honest, the lore was crazy.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nNo need to make this over the top, but believe me, those were some crisp looking eye candy right there, and it is expected from such a heavy budget movie of One Piece's, you better get yourself to immersive that animation, everything looks very fluid, the facial animations, the movements, even the backgrounds feel so much alive, you can get that the world is moving, and people are interacting out of view.\r\nWhat are very amazing, were the outfits, oh my, it's been a while since I saw that straw hats in mafia suits back on Film: Strong World, and get this, this movie was no difference, seeing the straw hats in them luxury tuxedos, and the girls in those fashionable dresses, that was amazing, and don't get me started, how they captured Robin and Nami's feminine side's, they were both beautiful.\n\r\n- Sound (10/10):\r\nI haven't been much of a picky guy when it came to the sound effects and music tracks in movies, but ever since the last movie, Film: Z, a new guideline was set off to me, I can't tolerate pitchily and cheat sound-craft special in heavy budget projects like this one, I expected something big, and boy did I get more than I saw coming, yes, everything from the music, or the most silent wisp of wind, you can see it so clear, the work on the soundtrack was fantastic, for each moment their track, the most sutable you can think about, and let's not overlook the voice acting here, boy, the cast knows what they're doing, I'm talking big performance here, even for those side characters, Baccarat did a phenominal job, replicating that accent while speaking some english words, it really captured the type of character she was playing, let's not forget about Gild himself, that villain laugh of his, second only to Doffy's.\n\r\n- Character (10/10):\r\nI don't usually give this high score to a movie project when it comes to characters and development giving the time span of the movie and events plus, most of the time, your characters are your usual straw hat members, but this movie falls into a special case, filled with new faces as well as very familiar ones, I spotted a lot of them in fact that I am pretty sure I could have missed a few.\r\nLet's talk about Carina for a second, a match for Nami, she was shown for a very brief shot on the prequel special for this movie, \u201cHeart of Gold\u201d. Foreshadowing her coming, and there she is, sharing a past with our cat burglar, they both shine in the profession (can I even call it that?), she was clearly in the spotlights, manages to steal your attention for once, the same can be told about Tesoro, as I mentioned before, the monster of the new world, totally lives up to his potential, and really seemed like a threat to the crew members, his ideology blent so well with his past, and his resulting present.\r\nAmong many amazing characters, there was one specific annoying individual that appeared on the first even teaser of the movie on that \u201cSilver Mine\u201d arc, that cat looking man, or is it a man looking cat? Whatever he is, he was a nuisance.\r\nAs I said earlier, in addition to those new characters, we got to see old ones, like Spandam, and Lucci, there was also Absalom and that guy from cypher pole whole Sanji fought on the train heading to Eniese Lobby whom he had to structure his face for a chance, it really makes you wonder about the odds. There was also Sabo and Koala, let's not forget Akainu too.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nLike the action-adventure-comedy-thrill loved I am, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, the 2 hours animation felt like a journey, that ended very fast, time sure passes when you have fun the most huh!!\r\nI would like to see upcoming movies of the same quality, that would be quite the treat, to be honest, it's been a while since I watched a movie and ended up liking it, this one is out there among the best of the best.\n\r\n- Overall(9.8/10):\r\nThye way this movie is, makes me want to recommend it even to the non-One-Piece-fans, it would even pull people to getting into One Piece, I pinned this to my to-watch-list 6 months ago, and I'm wondering why I have ignored it this whole time, totally a worth watching movie.\n"

            "content": "\n                To be, or not to be, many have considered the meaning of being and had it centered around one's needs and wishes. As human beings, we eat, we drink, we love, we hate, we sin... and we wish. Controversy has been flaming about the latter entry, as some parties prefer to say \u201cwe need\u201d, while others think that \u201cwe want\u201d is easier on the ear, but reality is absolute and fairly simple, very allergic to fantasy, and ruled by logic and basic physics, and as the wind blew across all the ages, people have always held places where they could be and do whatever theywanted as sacred, and found of dreams a holy paradise to beg the time of rest of coming for.\r\nBut as complicated the cosmos we pale in comparison by, the tiniest piece of a human brain still exceeds the most advanced technological artifact we've ever come to invent and in that complex fusion of organic specimens something of deep ambiguity that could even break a simulation by paralleling another one on top of it at the same time multi-tasking style, a more friendly term would be, dreams, and they come in variations of their own, there is the one heavy on fantasy, and there is the one that makes it hard to tell it apart from reality, and between the two resides many other  stages. One other very interesting side of dreams are the so-called lucid dreams, dreams where the dreamer is partially conscious and able to act at will and play with all the physics-defying environment of his or her dream. Something so desirable, it inspired a lot of fictional works, the likes of the movie \u201cInception\u201d, This movie had a quite different take on this idea by presenting an unbalanced shifter, so as you have your night and day, man and woman, dream and reality. A unique lone individual with no counterpart was thrown into the mix, somebody as troubling as an over-spiced Indian dish with a name that couldn't sound any more Indian to my ears, enter, \u201cPaprika\u201d.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nAs quick as a wink, the introduction unwraps with no prior warning, throwing you right off the bat in the middle of the composition, with no explanation given at first whatsoever, which at some degree in the early moments was a bit frustrating for me for how complicated everything sounded, but as it clicked, later on, I only converted my earlier frustration to  a massive appreciation for having it start that way, and to be honest, figuring out stuff by yourself as the story throws more hints at you as a huge part of the satisfactory realization of the plot, it feels like earning up your enjoyment with a sweaty hand rather than being spoon-fed every joke or reference.\r\nThe pacing started off very fast and remained as such in the entirety of the movie, as it focuses on multiple main characters and a lot of conflicting events, it just had to. As everyone was presented to be isolated individuals, they all started getting closer and made sense in each other's contexts as the same pieces of the same greater story they portray. Something you don't really get in a lot of shows is the balance of action and involving dialogue, and it seems that Paprika had an easy time mixing up both oils together, you'll often see characters in a rush, making it through a life-threatening situation while discussing crucial information on the fly making you both involved in their surroundings spotting action all over the place while at the same breathtaking off those loads of information like a goal-keeper.\r\nGiven the main topic be as complex and interesting as far as \u201cdreams\u201d go, on the surface, the idea is pretty simplistic and clear, a team of scientists has succeeded in creating a prototype for a device that makes it possible to share your dreams with somebody else, that is, unless multiple dreams start to intersect with each other, and as deep and confusing dream manipulation becomes, the line between dreams and reality becomes microscopically cellular and everything transforms into this nightmarish cage that sets one against the other.\r\nMore than anything else, every character is exposed to what they fear the most, and happen to encounter those fears in their dreams while dragging others with them whom they also bring up their fears along, making for a horrific terror-fest that's never worth being part of. In the end, it served as the perfect way to draw out the worse of everyone, making the saying \u201ctruth lies in panic\u201d not a single bit less true.\n\r\n- Art (9.8/10):\r\nEver woke up and had already forgotten what you've dreamed about as soon as you opened your eyes? I know that feeling, and it's very frustrating. And then came Paprika, a dream like no other, that is experienced when awake and thus sticks to the memory like a first brand glue, and probably it does because of the unbelievable quality put into its stunning visuals.\r\nIt does look like something, but honestly, after a good analysis, you'll start seeing how above mediocre it really is, so what really makes it feel better?\r\nIt's those fantastically detailed shading technics. I mean, look at Minecraft, beautiful game, but not quite visual in the sense of realistic context, and then you add shaders and it's a completely different atmosphere that retains the same geometrical graphics but still differs entirely. There was a slight warm gradient tint layering on top of the context, the lighting effects and shadows felt really, dynamic and spoke of \u201cthis is real\u201d, it was the main factor that set the simple 2D animation into a whole new level which made for the perfect replacement of using CGI, and we all know who easily that can be badly implemented, and there is nothing worse than bad CGI.\r\nUnfortunately, not to say CGI was absent, I had spotted a few occurrences where they've used it and it was not horrible per say but did feel weird as they didn't quite match the same shading they applied on the rest of the 2D animations, it was really quick and shore, I'd say about 2 minutes total worth of CGI, and it could have been better without it.\r\nOne other highlight I'd like to point out to is character design, I haven't been fascinated by this aspect since I first watched \u201cAkira\u201d. Realistic real-life human proportions with eyes the perfect size and anatomy so close to real but far from being uncanny. I really enjoyed how every character looked and moved, which brings us to movement. So fluid and satisfying as if every flexing muscle in their body has already been planned which made for such a detailed sequence of movement. One other thing that's worth to point out  is the wallpaper-worthy backgrounds, no kidding, I could at least get 3 high-quality screenshots every minute worth of animation, they all felt natural hand drawn, I really appreciate the minimalistic CGI touches, something that's the product of effort is always better than the hacky stuff.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nFor the honest emotion and immersive involvement I got from listening to the voice acting I immediately raised my hat in respect of the passion the voice actors and actresses put in their performance. Dreams are a very personal experience, and to be able to express them requires you to not only put the matching words in place but also speak with an equally emotional tone of voice, and that was especially nailed by the female characters (Paprika and Chiba Atsuko, both voiced by the same actress \u201c\r\nHayashibara Megumi\u201d who's also known for voicing Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop, Haibara Ai from Detective Conan, you know what I mean, big deal), also, shout out to the cop Konakawa Toshimi that shares the same voice actor with Black Beard (One Piece), Ootsuka Akio.\r\nOne other very strong Yonko-level aspect was the killer soundtrack, seriously, I had to pause at the mark of the first five minutes of the movie just to make sure I bookmarked the golden OST I was hearing, it's fantastic, it's optimistic, oddly relaxing and sourcing of hope, I just love every tingling note of it.\r\nSound effects were also brilliant, there are the ones that sing of colorfulness, and the ones that scream of creepiness, in a good way.\r\nI no joke was being shifted from one mood to the other given the strong rule of music in Paprika, and it's only normal that something as universal as music and dreams makes for a great pair. It's often viewed that nightmares and uncomfortable music come in one body, which good and happy dreams sound of relaxing ear candy, and this was of a massive presence in the entirety of the movie as it got you closer to feeling what the characters are feeling, fearing for them, rooting for them, and probably later, dreaming of them.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nA story can be the core, but characters add the topping.\r\nTackling a topic as transparent as dreams are demands for multiple use cases as referred to in experiments. A single individual will always give the same result, but different ones will result in a variety of results. That is to say, nobody is the same as the others in any way, including dreams, you never know what's in someone's head, let alone what's going on there while dreaming.\r\nPaprika had us exposed to people with different treats and characteristics and examined how different every one dreams. A troubled cop will have different thoughts than that of a scientist's, just to present a basic point.\r\nDepression is always accumulated by nightmares. A therapist will surely help by involving you in a simple conversation, but there is nothing better than dissecting it by hand and pressing the perfect cure for it, the problem remains to be that depression is something intangible , it's an idea that doesn't kneel in the world of simple physics, it can't be interacted with physically per say, but words have proven to traverse dimensions will keeping hold of as many deep messages. Given the plot of the story revolving around invading other's dreams makes that the other way around. You can for once intrude others' nightmares and give a helping hand when they are living the utmost of their fears. All that probable-incohesive talk goes to say, that character development is observed in a whole other level, you don't get person A exposed to event B and thus resulting in a character level up, and instead, you get to follow up everything about that development, it's causes, it's rate, it's origin...etc.\r\nAll the characters were likable, some even striking for pop-culture references. I couldn't put my finger on any possible weak character as every named one served a purpose in a way.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nAs fancy as a dream, and as quick as one as well, such is the seamless first-time watcher experience I got at least.\r\nPaprika nailed one sneaky aspect for one-shot stories, you get your serialized shows spanning episodes and still struggle with delivering the core message, and then you get Paprika. You start off as confused as a fresh new spawned player in PUBG and kind of work your way from there, it feels like a hard earnt fun time. More than anything, the concept was what drew me in and kept me up the tracks, I'm found with dreams as being the drug our brain is addicted to while we're asleep, and it's just as addictive as being captured on a movie's lore so easily.\r\nPart of the enjoyment as well was the realization of how lucky we are to get a unique free dimension of illusions we can do all the sandbox-y stuff at, it makes you rethink the current AI advancement and how it could eventually affect this, I know I don't want to live in a world like that.\n\r\n- Overall (9.0/10):\r\nI feel like I've already spat some truth on why you should at least give Paprika a try for it is more than a self-contained story (if you've been able to keep up along), it simply requires a bit more hard work in putting some extra focus on what's going on, because getting distracted by the odd world of dreams is just as easy as falling asleep after a long day of exhausting work.\r\nOne other thing I'd like to point out is the several sexual intercourses, maybe you're somebody that minds avoiding shows like that, in this case, would be understandable, there are some screenings for nudity as far as showing off breasts (nipples included), as well as a fully exposed female naked body, however, no genitalia were shown.\r\nI know I'm going to rewatch this at least a time every year from now on, and I'll get some company in too.\n"

Upon hearing the song in Film Redand again in the One Piece anime, I thought the accompanying visuals were okay, they did the trick, and they reflected well on the theme of the song, but man the visuals that ship with the song is something else let me tell you, stunning, out of the world. It's like a mix of Ghibli films and world-class clay art that felt like reading through a magical children's book.\n\r\nLong story short, listen to Ado more often.

            "content": "\n                *Sigh*, I haven't felt so immersed in a fictional world since I last saw the trilogy of The Lord of the ring movies, I had watched the first season of No Game No Life in a long time ago, I can almost confess that I had begun to lose interest on the series as it has started to fade out from my memory as the great series I thought it was, but man, was this movie a fantastic remainder on how amazing and deep the lore of the story can get, things seemed to be so intense, and the past story behind the current series'sevent makes a lot of sense of the series.\r\nThis movie sort of a historical event teller, a prequel to season one, involving around what happened during the ancient war, and how it ended, and how the game ruled planet became to be, with different characters, but also very similar to our protagonists in an amazing way.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nOur story is set in the past, 6000 years ago, portraying the horror of war, and what humans had to deal with, all of those meaningless deaths, and a great lost hope of freedom.\r\nA guy named Riku who is haunted by his nightmares of causing his fellow comrades to make sacrifices, and thus blaming himself for killing them, having to living through that ordeal every day, until he by accident meet a certain individual from the Ex-Machina race (is it considered as a race?) who was making research about human hearts, and how emotions work, as the emotionless machine she is, keeps observing the way Riku acts, trying to uncover that mysterious magic called \u201clove\u201d, that was the most compressed summary of the story that I could come up with without having to mention any spoilers.\r\nAs you will keep watching, not only would you notice how similar Sora and Riku look like, but they also act the same and think identically, it's almost as Sora is some kind of reincarnation of Riku's, not only him, the same can be told about Shiro and Schwli do bare some similarities, also Stephanie and Couronne, it makes you think how deep and insane all of those similarities are, the thing that keeps you hyped up for a second season for the series.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nCom on now, it's MadHouse again, and without a doubt, it's apparent that the visuals are going to look stunning unsurprisingly, and I thought that the series couldn't look any more stunning, this I a big budget movie, so the art is even more amazing, the backgrounds, the landscape, the characters, everything looked very appealing to the eye, there was some use of CGI, but man, did they nail it nevertheless.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nJust like the visual production, the sound-craft was going almost on par, the music played a huge role to emphasize certain moments, be it loud or silent, it was all for the better.\r\nLet's not step up to the voice acting, ok, now, I'm a DUB man, I watch almost all of my shows dubbed, I would have watched the DUB version of the movie, but I couldn't find it on my streaming site, so I went with the SUB version, and I got to tell, that was unexpectedly outstanding, the performance of the actors deserves some world-class award in this one.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nDon't get me wrong, I liked Shiro, and I'm not one who gives a care in the world about loli characters, they are not my thing nor do I see myself loving them, Shiro was an exception because of his mature attitude, but not until I was exposed to this amazing character, Schwli, she has got to e my favorite loli character so far, what's really intruiguing about her, is how she progressed, how she managed to beat all of the odds that stood on her way, and most importantly, how much she added to the story, another character would be Riku himself, I guess, here I would have to say that he and Sora are hard to choose between, as I said before, they are so similar that you could swear they are reincarnations of the same person, Stephanie's ancestor Couronne was way better than her, on so many levels, for instance, she was not a fanservice doll that everybody molests, it was nice to see Jibril too.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.5/10):\r\nI experienced such the feels rollercoaster in this one, I got to see more of Disboard's world, the lore was crazy, so immersive and makes you wish there was some VR game that transports you to such a world. some of the characters looked very relatable and human, so delicate and weak in a very dangerous and unforgiving world, the way how they survived and managed to beat the odds is very motivating in itself.\n\r\n- Overall (9.3/10):\r\nWould I recommend this? absolutely, even for the people who never watched the series, it would be such a perfect attraction for them to do so, primal knowledge about the season one's story is not 100% recquired, but watching the series first will help you a lot to understand some of the things that might go over the typical viewer's head.\n"

The feeling of emptiness you get after witnessing an impactful story and getting attached to the characters. But did Bleach leave that strong of an impact in me, as a fan that has only gotten into the series 2 years ago, frequently having occasional, sometimes lengthy breaks in betweenarcs. Was it because I never wanted it to end, or was it because the show was already burning me off, discarding every wrench of hype and excitement I had for it before I invested the time to check it out?\n\r\nAfter having watched Naruto, and then passed through the grueling but phenomenal experience that was and is One Piece, Bleach was the only behemoth in the way of me obtaining that sweet, seducing big three completion trophy. Although it is an imaginary one, being a fan of Anime and Manga, in general, gets me in the spirit to see all, or at least, most of what impacted the industry throughout the years, and the big three were probably the biggest push that's still holding its flare alongside One Piece till this day. And with Naruto having already wrapped up, and One Piece still serializing, Bleach always felt like that abandoned son who had quite as much potential as the two but ended up being discarded and left out to wither by the eternal unescapable decay known as time. We can only hope for a continuation or even better, a reboot sometime in the near future, but for now, all we have is a bundle of OG action, packaged into a balanced amount of Badassery and grueling filler.\n\r\nStory (8.3/10):\r\nComing up from an era where what's considered clich\u00e9 and oversaturated now was just the norm and sometimes, the pickle of storytelling from what concerns Anime, stepping in fully knowing that it's a Shounen show about superpowers and never giving up I guess, it does stand the weight of time, seeing as even now, most modern Shounen seem to cling to the same trend as back then, so the story comes with a big of familiarity, even for a recent Anime fan that has never seen a show passed the 2010's era.\n\r\nWhat really fascinates me about Shounen is the varying and unique themes. Condensing this to the big three only; You've got Ninja in Naruto, Pirates in One Piece, and Shinigami in Bleach, very interesting on their own way, but to me at least, Bleach has a very distinctive setting, something that revolves heavily on fiction and urban legends, religious references and most of all, a cut of the fascinating Japanese folklore.\n\r\nWith a disappointing tone, however, unlike the other two shows, where Naruto aims to become a Hokage, and Luffy being the King of the Pirates, Ichigo stands in a very odd place, where his personal goal is not quite clear, seeing how he was dragged into the Shinigami game as a force of circumstance by some guy who apparently broke ten walls passed the fourth one and directed to story in which he exists making sure everything goes according to their *plan*. Of course, you could say that Ichigo is in for protecting his loved ones, but that's about it. But an unclear goal doesn't always lead a boring journey.\n\r\nSpanning several arcs and saga, dropping multiple unique powers and heavy players into the story, the unfinished cultural phenomenon and member of the big three (Bleach) has layout out an interesting formation for its major arcs, that co-relate perfectly with the main characters.\r\nLooking at the quad; Rukia, Orihime, Sado (Chad), and Ury\u016b serve more than just characters that accompany Ichigo in his journey, but rather as pillars of their own Sagas that tell a self-contained story wich still relates heavily with the general scope of the story, in which Ichigo IS the one used to tell their stories through, like the camera in an FPS game.\n\r\nAfter the first arc \u201cAgent of the Shinigami\u201d, where Ichigo is introduced to the nature of his power, his natural foes and basically, the system in which the world runs on, Rukia Kuchiki, the mysterious Shinigami that gets Ichigo in the game acts as the key that leads the story into the \u201cSoul Society\u201d saga, admittedly, the best \u201cintroductory\u201d Saga amount the big three, and probably, all of Shounen (Big that's debatable). As it spans 2 arcs, efficiently introducing all there is about Shinigami, how they operate and how they come into play and basically labeling them as the \u201cgood\u201d side. I gotta give Kubo-sensei some points on how to cleverly direct the plot looking at how amazing the transition between the first arc and this saga happened, with Rukia (a Shinigami) being the bridge in which Ichigo steps in and then out (The Soul Society, where the Shinigami reside) at the end of it.\n\r\nRight after that spectacular introductory saga, comes the amazing \u201cArrancar\u201d saga, which spans 7 arcs of destructive battles and fast-paced sword clashes against evolved Hollows (If you will) and is told utilizing Orihime Inoue (Suffered gravely from a lost family member by the hands of Hollows) to narrate what goes through from action, desperation, to emotion. It had definitely had its ups and certainly, lows, mainly because it felt like a bootleg recycle of the fantastic Soul Society saga at first, until it branches off, making something new of itself. This is where also my favorite stand-alone arc was. \u201cThe past\u201d arc.\n\r\nAfter what felt like an endgame for the series, and after so many episodes and development, Sado (Chad) gets his shot to shine, but still somehow missed it, having the spotlight mostly focused on Ichigo once again, ignoring what probably the best spot for Sado to take. The \u201cFullbring\u201d saga, which was also its own single arc \u201cThe Lost Substitute Shinigami\u201d arc shined some new lights on stuff that we used to question at the start of the series, but got lost in our thoughts as other things were taking up attention. The arc makes a great effort to somehow, level up the risks at stake even after a faith deciding a grand war, it gave off some characters more development than they did the entire series and overall was a very different experience from the rest of the show, with a brand new theme, somewhat of a darker atmosphere. I'm still swearing on episode 358 as being my absolute favorite in the series, from what unique and heart-racing directing techniques it had that really made it show the horror that the characters are living. (Tsukishima, you rat)\n\r\nFinally, comes Ury\u016b, although, at this point, the Anime has already finished, so if it wasn't for my curious stupid, I wouldn't have been spoiled about, even if those were some minor spoilers. Let's just say, there is something about Quincies in there.\n\r\nBrilliant, that is if the fillers made it any easier to sit through. What was probably my biggest and most obvious reason for taking multiple breaks in between the arcs was the dreading filler arcs that startup with a raised amount of hype, but die out 3 to 5 episodes later. I always watch my shows filler-filled or not, I endured Naruto's filler, TWICE, and it was hard, One Piece's filler was actually very entertaining and fir the theme of the story very well, their short and minimal length (casually 2 to 5 episodes) was a big factor in their enjoyment, but Bleach's filler was long, dreading, and hard to follow. I would give credits where credit is due, so the \u201cZanpakut\u014d Unknown Tales\u201d arc, you hit the jackpot. That is what I call a filler, and right after, follows the \u201cGotei 13 invading army\u201d arc, the animation in this both arcs was amazing, speaking more specifically the final fight between Ichigo and Kager\u014dza was probably my favorite fight animation-wise in the entire series, with eye-melting visuals, fluid movements and amazing coordination, it was way too good for a filler fight and it didn't sit with me though how such a budget was spent on filler material while some of the biggest highlights of the show looked very pale in comparison.\n\r\nThe pacing kind of drops and lifts up randomly, very dependent on the arc at play, there are your fast-paced arcs like \u201cThe past\u201d arc, and pretty much everything else varies from time to time.\n\r\nArt (8.2/10):\r\nOf course, for a relatively old show, the first thing that strikes the eye is how dusty the whole thing looks. We've been spoiled a lot with top-notch move-like animation in modern seasonal shows, so it shows when looking at something from a prior era of the industry where even the aspect ratio feels like being in the stone age, melting iron and dusting seashells with Senku. But given consideration, those were different times, and for sure, and as noticeable as it is, as you get through from arc to arc you definitely notice spikes in visual quality, and that's not county the highlights that get the better treatment than the rest of the episodes.\n\r\nA long-running bless that comes with watching Bleach is the quality character design. Mainly talking about transformations, you get to see some of the most pleasing and interesting looking figures. Feathers, wings, horns, holes in the chest, spiky swords, something that you'd imagine wouldn't quite work out if assembled together, but it proves you wrong as soon as you take a glance at it, and start unconsciously to appreciate the talent that made that possible. Sometimes, I personally stop and think if Kubo-sensei passed off a chance to get into fashion design.\n\r\nOne thing I think this show does the best compared to the other two show from the big three is the use of particles that go into creating dust, fog, lightning, smoke, fire and every other practical effect, they all feel so flawless, as though they are having a physical weight. They appear thick (but not as THICC as Rangiku), dense and powerful. The impact the camera and the viewport itself the same way the characters react to them. They have a presence.\r\nHowever. When it comes to shaping up character faces, it seems that Kubo's brush always twists out the same way. That would explain what a huge variety of male characters appear similar to Ichigo in a way that even his father and both sisters don't. Sh\u016bhei? Ichigo with a different hair-color and some tattoos, Ikaku? Bald Ichigo and so on...\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nI love talking about the vocals. And Bleach makes my love for vocals even more passionate. To start with. All of the openings and endings are amazing. disdainful and reflect the tone of their respective arcs very well. Opening 1 is a straight-up party banging classic, opening 5 is a continuous eargasm, opening 12 is a hyper overflow for what makes the greater part of the Arrancar arc's battle, and opening 13 is a visual-vocal masterpiece bundle, rocking with an amazing song paired with a product of some interesting classic film trickery, which creates a composition of encrypted messages through the visuals that may not accordingly tell what's happening at the first glance.\n\r\nThe soundtracks are straight out a winner here. It blows both Naruto's and One Piece's collection for me personally. Heavily relies on a Spanish cord which encapsulates perfectly what's thrown at it on the visual dimensions; sorrow, despair, surrender, terror, victory...\n\r\nBefore some of you sneaks up on me with an uppercut. Yes, I watch the English Dub version of Bleach, And it was glorious. I do believe that the Japanese version is probably more immersive and compelling, but that's just my tradition when it comes to watching any of the big three. The first watch is always in English Dub, and then every other rewatch is switching over to (Mostly) the superior Sub. What can I say? I have literally no complaints. I loved all the actors and actresses. They truly were doing something they loved.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nI've talked about this briefly when I was discussing the story. Ichigo's biggest problem as a character is his unclear goal. Although it doesn't get in the way of the story, it does leave a lot of desire in him as a protagonist. And the Anime at least doesn't disclose on that.\r\nAside from that, you can still see him as a relatable character, one that cares about whom he loved, he wants to protect them, he wants to be there for them, very selfless and very young. Very easy to relate to.\n\r\nAlong with the progress of the story, every saga introduces a huge bundle of new faces to keep track of, but it gets easier seeing as each one of them is, for the most part, likable. Or at least from each faction (Shinigami, Arrancar, Fullbring, Quincy...), there is always those select of characters that keep it interesting for you.\r\nThe main villain of the broadcast part of the story that the Anime follows is, to say the least, a very attention deserving character. Normally you'd find yourself interested in his ideology, keeping up with his twisted thinking only because apparent as his true nature slowly but surely shows. Orchestrating every other major twist in the show in a way that would leave you wondering if he's broken through the four walls already and planed ahead of you having to watch the show in which he stars at. A good example I like to pair him up with is Dofflamingo, but only the twisted side of both of them.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nBleach was a very odd experience, especially having watched it last, after One Piece and Naruto, but it feels quite at home with the other two. It's been a slow two years for me, filled with life-changing decisions that it's reminiscent for me enough to get stuck in my head for the rest of my life. I got attached to the characters, had my fair share of fanboyism multiple times, screamed when powerups happened, teared up when the show made me tear up, and certainly, grieved when episode 366 ended. Now all I'm going to say is #BringBleachBack and read what's left out of the story in the Manga in anticipation, hoping that one day I'll wake up to the news of Bleach's continuation, or even better, a Bleach Brotherhood announcement.\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10):\r\nIf you're like me, having already watched both One Piece and Naruto, then what's stopping you from sealing off the big three package for once and for all? It is definitely the shortest series between the three, scoping only at 366 episodes. And if you're not much of a filler guy, you can cut them off and do with 284 episodes. WATCH IT!!\r\nAnd with that, I pay my respect to the series, the faithful fandom, and the man, the legend himself, Tite Kubo. I'll leave off for now with this.\n\n\n\n\r\n#BringBleachBack\n"

            "content": "\n                I feel like I've already put down enough paragraphs on what this show is back when I reviewed the first season, and to be honest, it was more of last year's hit, however, in honor of an honest series, another review is the least I can do to show my appreciation for a show that most people think of as a joke, but end up sleeping on a decent wholesome fest that doesn't get much recognition, if it doesn't have boobs it's not worth the watch, that's the phrase they live by, while agreeing as much as Dandy would himself, it's way too generic tospit it overflows many good shows as victims of lackluster and low following.\r\nRemember the thing about the futuristic civilization that will come to earth to find some copies of Pingu's first season and get a wrong idea on us as a capable life form? Well, scratch that, what if they ended up enjoying it as much as we did, and so as a tribute, they produced a new season of the show. Several millions of years later, yet another more advanced life form arrives at earth and manages to get by the remains of the last inhabitance of our poor planet, and ended up finding out about the new season of Pingu in The city. Actually, scratch that, I way off topic I should just stick to the review.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nFascinating how simplistic but very reflective are the problems discussed in this show. The episodic nature of the show remains as strong as ever with this season with a better topic to discuss, stuff like stealing, lying and all sorts of basic bad habits that the kids should be aware of and avoid are all adapted into their own respective episodes that go ahead and with a great effort show numerous examples of their causes and consequences and always ending up with a wholesome wrap up at the end of said episode.\r\nAs we've come to know, all episodes are extremely short, spanning around 7 minutes including both the opening and the ending which leaves us with a limited content that at the end of the day doesn't fall short on delivering the message. The show really teaches a lot of daily ethics that we forget about most of the time showing examples of their effects on a personal side (Everything related to Pingu) and on one's surroundings (Everybody else).\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nBeautiful spot motion that's simple enough to carry on the moral of the episodes. Its childish visuals still strikingly apparent but it was always meant to be that, you can't really complain about the fluidity of the animation of the alteration of the anatomy concerning body proportions, because at the end of the day, they are all just penguins that tend to have way more flexibility on their bodies than a world-class renowned gymnast.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nI think at this point we can all live by their constant span of \u201cNOOT\u201d and would never take anything else for a replacement, even if it was legit voice acting with big names taking on the roles. The dialogue was never relevant as the moral of the story was always the message, the actions that we physically do will never be excused by simply spitting some words, perhaps that was the reason for having all of the Penguins noot all the time.\n\r\n- Characters (7/10):\r\nThere was never a character that makes you go nuts on consuming all of those latest figurines the moment they show up, it's just Pingu, the dude that's all of the worlds is centered around. The show features a full sized city populated with a lot of Penguins of different treats and professions and never neglects a single one of them as all of them have episodes they shine on which is always appreciated. Writing up characters and never referencing again was always a bad thing, and \u201cPingu in the City\u201d addresses that greatly.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nThe joy of watching \u201cPingu in the City\u201d was always from anticipating what's the next ethic the episodes are going to tackle, I don't think binge watching this series works in a good fashion as watching it weekly does have its effects if you're planning to live by the great advice the show provides, a week worth of time between every episode could also be an opportunity to adapt to the moral lesson you just learned from Pingu.\r\nThe factor of wholesomeness is also something worthy of mentioning, I'm rare to find a show that genuinely helps you relax, it doesn't require any extensive processing to get and is just there to entertain you whenever you've nothing else to do.\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\r\nRecommending this to an outsider of the series might lead them to doubt your mental health in many ways, and it's sad to think that this is what the general public thinks of this show, no, it's not for a specific age demographic and was never meant to be, learning good moral is a great thing to live by and you could at least be appreciative to this new kid in the block that's willing to help up shape a genuine person out of you.\n"

It turned up to be just a huge chess game, but boy has it been worth it, there is a lot of development as the story goes by, and there has been a lot of teasing on past events that really gets you hyped up to know more about this strange world.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nIs there anything else to say here? Like seriously, the most colorful world I've got to see animated, with the red color dominating, might seem a bad idea, but wait until you see the result, the animation was marvelous, character designs are great!!! But hey, It's Madhouse we're talking about, that's nothing strange.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nYes, you heard me, that was a glorious audacious ride, from amazing sound effects to fascinating tracks, the feels and emotions you get to experience from the songs alone, you don't get to experience such a well-composed track in all anime shows, but this one stands on top of many.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nHere where it sucked for me at least, besides Shiro and Sora, other character seemed so 2D for me, outstanding treats or interesting vibes around there, the relationship between our sibling heroes that share the name [Blank] was somehow explicit, the wincest was present on a huge scale, I guess considering the two, there was no remarkable character development, but not the same can be said about Steph, she, for the most part, had some character development although it's nothing too remarkable as well, she stood at as a fanservice doll, for the most part, talking about fanservice, this show was a train wreck for this, how is it rated PG again?\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThis is such a one-seat piece of cake, I, however, divided this into 2 days worth-of-watch, I got to know how much this show will be good from the first episode alone, so I decided not to rush through it, and take my time watching and admiring its aspects. I dove in with 0 expectations, I've heard of this show so much in the past, but the art somehow kept me away from it, now that I've finished it, I have no regret but the ordeal of wait, I need a sequel and fast!!!\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nI tried to be less biased rating this, I feel bad because this show could have been even more enjoyable if it wasn't for the forced fanservice, would I recommend it? well, it depends, are you the type that enjoys a fleshed out story about games set on a magical world? would you mind some fanservice along the ride? well, this is a good show for you.\n"

            "content": "\n                \"Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden\" or \"NARUTO Spin-Off: Rock Lee & His Ninja Pals\" is a spin-off of the popular series \"Naruto: Shippuuden\". The series follows the story of Rock Lee, a ninja who lacks the typically required abilities and has to compensate for this handicap with severe training and creative fighting techniques. The series is set in a super-deformed art style, which is a strange choice for a spin-off of a serious series like \"Naruto\". The series is also narrated by a narrator, which is an unusual element in an anime.\n\r\nOne of the major criticisms of the series is that itcould have been a canon adaptation of the original series, instead of a non-canon spin-off. Fans of the original series were disappointed that the series didn't follow the main characters and storylines of the original series. On the other hand, the series did give some screen time to Tenten, a character who was often overlooked in the original series.\n\r\nThe humor in the series is also a point of criticism, with many describing it as childish and repetitive. However, the ending song of the series is praised for being catchy and memorable. The series is also criticized for having episodes that are difficult to understand even for adults. It's juvenile, repetitive, and quite honestly, not funny. The jokes are often centered around bodily function and toilet humor, which can be inappropriate and off-putting for some viewers. The references in the series are also quite bad, often feeling forced and out of place.\n\r\nNot to mention, the main character Rock Lee is just plain annoying and his constant training and fighting techniques just get old quickly. I don't know about you, but I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through another episode of this hot mess. I can't even recommend it to die-hard Naruto fans, it's that bad. Save yourself the time and just stick to the original series.\n\r\nOverall: 4.4/10.\n"

Zankyou no Terror (or Terror in Resonance) takes place on a modern Japan, a place still haunted by the post-war and political conflicts more shock than a handkerchief on a windy evening. And as the title might suggest, it discusses elements of a serious phenomenal the world has come to be pretty common with lately. Terrorism, and youthful rebellion. But can terrorism ever be justified?\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nSeveral mysterious terrorist attacks take Japan bystorm in consecutive order led by two individual 17 years old guys, respectively called Nine and Twelve under the cover-names of Sphinx 1 and Sphinx two. The two adolescents go through challenging the local police by planting random locations with explosives and giving the cops a deadline to race time with, solving riddles and disarming the bombs in time. That is after they get this troubled girl involved with them, meet Lisa, a clumsy high schooler depressed from her life wanting a way out of her boring routine.\r\nThese genius teenagers, of course, having a greater goal to achieve that made them start these terrorist attacks in the first place, but luckily, the police on this show are not dumb, and manage to corner them at times.\r\nThe speed of the story progression is great and gives focus on the backstories and character development, balancing between intense action and devastating emotional moments, it makes you see how much of a change can a mere three inexperienced kids against the whole world achieve.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nWelcome to the how to produce a good animation 101 course, the first lesson would be, AVOID USING HORRIBLE CGI, NO, AVOID USING CGI ANIMATIONS AT ALL COST. I went harsh on the caps on that one, for that, I apologize, but seriously tho, especially on modern Anime, while there are great CGI shows, the rest 95% are just absolute trash (Getting some painful 3D Berserk flashbacks), most of the issues come due to mixing 2D and 3D animation methods, a simple slip up can screw up a whole scene (Inuyashiki had great transitions though, well, most of the time that is).\r\nI really appreciate the direction the animation department went on with this one, I don't recall seeing any use of extreme CGI in the whole 11 episode span of animation, at least, none that I could notice, which is absolutely great. Being a show about terrorism, explosions would take a big part of it, and I'd have to say, those were some amazing explosion sequences, the debris and shockwaves, the blast and the change to warmer color tint after each blast was flawless. Moving to the character designs, those were some real characters in both anatomy and general facial expressions, and don't even get me started on how beautiful the digitally painted background looked.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nThe voice actors starring in this pick were promising and good at what they've presented, the likes of Kaito Ishikawa (Ida from Boku no hero Academia, and Genos from One Punch Man to name a few of his roles), and with serious toned shows like Zankyou no Terror they didn't slack one bit to deliver what you'd expect from terrified, put in danger people, the hesitation in their voice, their cries and their screams all had a real weight to it.\r\nThe soundtracks were strong on this one with smooth transitions between the intense and emotional blood thrilling tracks.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were gorgeous, and their resonance was that of its kind. I like how the opening song is a bit soft, feeling fragile and sad for what topic the show discusses, the same fall under the ending theme song as well.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nMost shows would just either have poor characters that don't fill up one's stomach or be filled with characters that can never serve a purpose for how short the series can be. Zankyou no Terror introduces a small but rich character cast that all of them get their moments of shine and development. There is the genius type that always makes the right decisions and leads all the intensity of the show, and there is also the clumsy dead weight that still has its importance to the progression of the story. Talking about Lisa specifically, out of everybody else, she seems the most relatable and realistic character in the mix. Most people come to hate her, but it's them that are in the wrong as if they could actually carry on terrorist tasks after just having introduced to the whole concept. She actually makes mistakes, she cries, she hesitates, but that's what make up normal humans. There is also detective Shibazuki, the only capable counterpart of the terrorists, that actually solves 90% of the riddles and act in accordance with time.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nZankyou no Terror gave me something unique that minimal shows have been able to, a realistic approach to our world and how most higher up stuff work, information can cost lives and not comparable to any fortune, and friendship can work wonders. Some people will go all the way as saying that this show was a desperate attempt to be like Death Note, where at the same time not being on good terms with themselves on what was the catch after the story. This is an original work, that yes, inspires a lot from other popular shows, but it's not something bad, as Zankyou no Terror has a resonance unique to itself. I felt for the characters, I smiled for them, I cheered for both sides and had a blast (no pun intended) doing so.\n\r\n- Overall (8.4/10):\r\nThis is a definitive rewatch material and a proud recommendation overall to both friends and family. Keep in mind the (R - 17+) rating, there are small sexual references and minimal gore, but the idea of terrorism can be a lot for the young ones to grasp or handle. I get why this show has always been highly recommended, and I can confirm that it deserves the recommendations. It's not a replica of other shows that you might have enjoyed and wants to experience something similar of, but rather, serves as its own experience.\n"

And no, being mainstream is never enough a reason to call a show average.\n\r\nThis 40 minutes long recap goes through the first 8 episodes of the show, highlighting the plot defining moments, which arguable I would say, were the best part of aseries that kept on driving down the hill to a point of no return. It was such a great and fun sit through that made me wish the rest of the show was this good and bearable so that I can get on a rewatch. It seems reality was clear and unforgiving.\n"

Make sure you watch the second episode of the OVA first, then the first. I know that's an odd order, but trust me, that's the right order to follow.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nPretty decent side stories for fun, no particular big plot surprise or anything aside from containing spoilers of the first 6 episodes of Noragami Aragato.\r\nThe first OVA resolves around Yato taking overHyori's body while he goes into a carefree spree around her school doing all sort of stuff in her name, with the rest of the folks trying to stop him.\r\nThe second OVA contains some major spoilers, but let's say the crew in its entirety goes on in a picnic, and have some actual fun until Yato pulls off a surprising highly-wished-for stunt.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nThe same slick and smooth art style and animation from the first season, really, nothing too spectacular and beyond decent I'd say.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nI'm more happy to hear the first season's opening and ending theme songs, these OVA focused on a more comedic light hearted stuff, so there was no inclusion of the fantastic dark soundtrack, but the comedy makes up for that.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nI love the cast of these OVA, all lovable characters. and Hyori isn't as annoying as people see here so often. Everybody was easy going and invested in the comedy, good days to remember.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nAhh, the time went by like a fly, and that only happens when you're having fun. I really liked these side stories and hopefully, I get to see more of these soon because nothing can make up for the sad fact of you ending a spectacular show like this than having to see some extras.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nI could actually highly recommend watching these, not like most OVAs who provide dead content, these ones had a lot to offer, and I'm specifically talking about a certain moment on the second OVA, god bless.\n"

Released somewhere in the messy schedule of 2017's seasonal shitfest, a time when I was still with more dignity to even consider diving into the cursed land of seasonal Anime, but it was just a matter of time until I picked it out of my plan-to-watch list.\r\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the nostalgic ending song that I happen to have heard during its release, it would have been still buried in my endless list to an unnamed day, and oh boy did it still disappoint at the end.\n\r\n- Story(4/10):\r\nA Plot you say? Nowhere to be found, or at least, not one that makes sense anyway. I would have probably settled down with rating it a \u201c0/10\u201d, but given the consideration of nitpicky things it did remarkable right, it was going to be a cruel judgment in its right.\r\nHow do I put this in words?! It was as if the poor contributors of this lost cause of a story were cursed with a savage beast from the underworld, equipped with a pointy baton that kept smashing every sense of plot there is to smithereens and everything related, ending up wasting a plotline of great premise (and unfortunately, poor execution).\r\nIt all started when two naive high schoolers started hooking up as a sort of medicine they had to take to cure the depression that came from their crushes never accepting their feelings for them. Would they be able to heal their scars at the end?\r\nA truly appealing premise with somewhat of a sense of identity that doesn't follow the common mainstream formula of storytelling and provokes a lot about taboo relationships and lost pride to a youthful lust that doesn't know the way (It's been a year since that meme was a thing, get over it).\r\nAlong the lines of using a creative visual rule to lay out the story (more on this later), it was complimented with a yet unique approach that revolved around telling the story through different monologues of the characters involved that helped bring everything full circle, giving you a sense of satisfaction after you see every scenario from different perspectives.\r\nIt was somewhere midway where everything broke down like a terrible train wreck that you'd think the writer was barely having a cohesive thought process and still wrote down whatever came in mind with no consideration to common sense like a damn drunkard that literally every episode becomes like a taunting fever dream.\n\r\n- Art (8.7/10):\r\nOn the surface, it's apparent that \u201cKuzu no Honkai\u201d is visually distinguishable if you look attentively, you'd notice the rough lines around the edges, especially on the characters, design-wise, they looked really good, perfected modern scribbles that try to stay as Anime as possible all while still trying to keep the realism most of the Anime lack visually.\r\nBut that was not the reason it was so self-defining at all, the Manga-like lay out on some of the scenes do leave a great mark on the show that tells it apart, having a static background behind a two highlighted face close up Manga-style does leave room for so much more symbolism and a great breather for the overall animation.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nLet's get the minor things away, the voice acting was decent, I really liked Hanabi's voice actress, going with a perfect tone of voice, while the rest of the case was pretty average, aside from maybe Akane's. But man, did I hate Moca's high pitched voice that screams of a childish loli.\r\nThe opening song was good, but not half a quarter as good as the ending is, and as I stated, a fantastic vocal performance that's the reason I decided to finally watch the show for.\r\nThere goes another bad adaptation that has fantastic vocals (The same as \u201cTaboo Tattoo\u201d and its undeserved opening song).\n\r\n- Characters (3/10):\r\nQuite a shallow over dramatic cast if I have ever seen one.\r\nLet's start by labeling every single one of them as a \u201cScum\u201d, don't you love it when a show is that much self-aware that it says it in the title?\r\nProbably the most uninteresting, contradicting and hypocritical group of characters out there. If the plot is to blame for 70% of flaws surrounding this show, the characters can take the other 50%, I know, that doesn't add up to 100%, because it's how much sense this show make anyway.\r\nThis was an example for a show that had a faster plot than the characters can keep up with, you'd be expecting even the slightest character development after a certain event, but no, not even after you, as a viewer, read all of the hints they let out and thinking, oh, logically, X is going to be the outcome, oh, let me stop you right there, scum and logic have nothing in common.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nDespite the many lows in there, there was a reason I sit through this in 2 days straight, although, I was starting to get fed up of the overly dramatic turnouts nearing the conclusion of the story.\r\nI had quite the laugh on some parts, and even nearly sympathized with some characters, but not after the plot turned its back on me giving me the middle finger.\n\r\n- Overall (6.64/10):\r\nI'm not sure if this is a recommendation entry in my book, if you were looking for any of the five rules of thumb that makes a show watchable (listed above), then you see how bad this one scales up, although, if you can settle with some drama that you won't have to take seriously, this is one hell of a guilty pleasure that I probably will never end up rewatching.\n"

National safety is being controlled by a system called \u201cThe Sibyl system\u201d, consisted of squads of inspectors with the help of latent criminals to take down people who are a danger to society, one day, a young and cheerful girl joins as a rookie inspector, setting a goal for herself to provide as much service she can, but the circumstances brought her to the most unfortunate first case anyone would beg for which completely opened her eyes on the gruesome reality she's living in. the story follows Akane Tsunemori and her squad, solving cases casually, until they hit the big fish, that helps bring the story a full circle, with a very, very rewarding ending.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nTruly, a work of big-budget production, you can't really complain about the facial expressions or the anatomy, everything is put into perspective, the characters are drawn in a very appealing way, and the animation adds that sweet touch of sugar on top of the cake.\r\nThe lightning and the dark color tone really helps blend the character with the backgrounds very atmospherically.\r\nThere was a very emphasis on the use of CG animations, it looks nice nevertheless, but there were few exceptions where it just looked awful and out of place.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nVery fast paced, and as dark as the story itself, this show has one of those scores that you would want to record and play afterward while you're meditating, practicing your hobbies, or just for the sake of enjoyment, and don't get me started on the intros and outros, the first ones has got to be the greatest I've ever heard, and the voice acting was on point for the major part, I watched the English DUB version, and I'm not complaining.\n\r\n- Character (10/10):\r\nI couldn't give it a more fitting score than this one, man, there were a lot of rich characters to go through, except for the main one, Akane while not being that great of a character, her colleagues really do shine, and I'm not speaking about the supposedly \u201cgood\u201d side, but god the antagonist was one of the greatest villains you'd find in anime, his sarcasm and ideology were on top of the charts, only followed by the protagonist, Shinya.\r\none thing they did great with Akane, is her development, you really get that sense of change, from the naive little puppy that just breached into the crime scene, to the fully mature inspector, who sees her job more seriously than ever.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nTotally worth the watch, this is one of those shows that lure you to binge them all, but don't fall into the trap, the fun resides on the partly watch, only then you can take the most out of the story, and focus more on its aspects, there is a lot going on once the story kicks in, so you are in for a treat.\n\r\n- Overall (9.2/10):\r\nI still think I'm going hard on this one, I should have been more toleratable in giving it a 10/10, but that's only something the second sequel can decide, I'd totally recommend this to the people who like dark fiction, there are a lot of aspects of gore, sexual content, and twisted turns of events, watch it on your risk, you, and only you are responsible on your Psycho-pass.\n"

The classic One Piece humor all over the place, the crazy over the top cartoonish designs, and the throwaway side plot that only serves as a presenta\u00e9tion device for the whole magical adventure.\n"

At first glance, it may seem deceptively simple, especially if you've watched the remake version first. But let me assure you, this anime has its own unique charm that's worth savoring.\n\r\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room \u2013 the animation. Was this show made in MS Paint? It's true; the animation might not win any awards for its visual prowess. In fact, I've seen omake episodes and picture dramasthat boasted better animation quality. However, here's the twist \u2013 this seemingly simplistic art style is like a hidden gem in itself. It sells a special kind of endearing vibe that's hard to replicate. It's as if the creators decided to take a different route and said, \"Let's make this deliberately simple, and it'll be absolutely endearing.\" And you know what? It works!\n\r\nNow, if you're coming to this version after watching the remake, you might initially find it a tad less fleshed out. But here's the thing: \"Hori-san to Miyamura-kun\" doesn't need all the bells and whistles. It's a masterclass in the art of subtlety. The story centers around Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura, two characters who couldn't be more different on the surface. Hori, the smart and popular girl, has to balance her school life with her hidden responsibilities at home. Miyamura, whom everyone sees as an otaku, harbors his own secrets.\n\r\nWhat makes this anime shine is how it gradually unravels these hidden sides and brings the characters closer. As Hori and Miyamura share parts of themselves that they couldn't with anyone else, it creates a heartwarming narrative that celebrates the beauty of authenticity and friendship. It's a reminder that sometimes, it's the simplest moments that leave the deepest impact.\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the ending songs \u2013 they absolutely slap! Despite its budget animation, \"Hori-san to Miyamura-kun\" knows how to set the mood with its music. The catchy tunes enhance the overall experience and stay with you long after you've finished watching.\n\r\nOverall: 5.6\n"

            "content": "\n                I remember watching this years ago, impressions were not that good, and thus, I labeled this movie as a try-hard failure of Makoto Shinkai, watching it in 420p did not help either, the years passed and my impression of it was that of the worst, until I randomly had the urge to watch it again, see how much my taste in Anime has grown, perhaps I've been harsh on the movie and didn't see it as the greatness it was, or maybe, it was too early for me as a person, at the time, I related to Takao (the highschooler dude) more because I wasin his age range at the time, surprisingly this time around, the teacher Yukino had a bigger impression on me relating with her struggles and exposure to the grown-up world, this movie was ahead of my intellect once upon a time, but now I realize what shameful disregard I had for it.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nThe story was no shining star, it's not something you hear in fairy tales, it tells an ugly story that reflects our real world, it's not as pretty as fantasy makes it seem. The link between the confused high schooler that's yet to take on the real world and the depressing outlook of the teacher that has taken fatal blows from time and reality was very fascinating and relatable, both individuals standing on the other side of the inevitable adulthood transition and yet they shared the same world but in different shoes, perhaps Takao's interesting in his shoemaking craft was just the metaphorical way of helping Yukino walk steadily in life, and in return, him saving her is salvation for him as well, even tho it's a dated craftmanship, it was honest enough to help another and better their days. The plot is metaphorically fantastic, but maybe too much abstraction can drain a comprehensive experience and limit its accessibility, the thing I think hurt the delivery of the plot the most.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nTo this day, and despite being a relatively old movie, a big part of my acknowledges this as Shinkai's best-animated marvel, and quite possibly the best-animated work ever. I huge and bold statement, I know, maybe the short length of the feature was just the right call to retain the consistency of this literal eye-candy. You know when computers started getting powerful enough, and every other game started having that shiny watery effect where every polygon reflects light like a perfect mirror? This was probably the movie version of that. For a story that involves rain as much as Kotonoha no Niwa, chances were not missed, every shot of rain dropping, ponds vibrating and clouds roaring was out of this world. I don't know how they were able to achieve this degree of realism and still retain a defining artistic touch on top of it is beyond anything I've seen. This truly was a tech-demo animation style.\n\r\n- Sound (10/10):\r\nIf I remember correctly, the main reason that led me to watch this movie years ago was the main theme that played over the movie's trailer, it was a good call. Having decided to rewatch the movie again, I was anticipating hearing the song by the end of every minute of the movie but I found myself greeted with all sorts of other equally good OSTs that almost made me forget that excitement. However, perhaps the real star of the movie was the excellently immersive and relaxing ambient sounds. I love the sound of rain, this movie was not shy from spoiling me on that and it never went doll from the first drop to the last one.\r\nThe voice acting was at a peak as well, two people having conversations and monologues for 40 minutes, I could have listened to them the whole day, the voice cracks, the laughter slips, everything felt genuine and real, weirdly intimate at times but always cheerful to hear.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nI thought the characters that lead this movie were quite secondary and barely important, they felt more like placeholder dummies delivering the real protagonist of the story, their struggles.\r\nThey say you are what you eat, my life has taught me, you are what you experience, from which eating is part of course, but circumstance is more prevalent in making the present you, but what makes the future you? Maybe present-you is just future-you in the past, a paradoxical question that runs from answering itself, that's when a helping hand is needed, we humans need each other to live, that's what nature makes us behave as, and perhaps, that's why it's been raining so much to the point Takao and Yukina were fated to meet under every chance mother nature decided to weep, leaving behind waterfalls of rain that meant to two people more than anything in their life.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI was very critical of this movie for a long time, or perhaps, I was just too young, too ignorant that I didn't even care to understand the core message, maybe I was thirsty to see someone I related with only by gender hook up with his teacher, hungry for a desperate relationship that was never meant to be, however, the passing years taught me what life is really about, how different it is from fantasy and how similarity bittersweet it is depending on how you experience it. This movie was a life lesson I was too young to care about, but no matter what phase you're living, it's only a passing one, and growing up does not wait for anyone.\n\r\n- Overall (8.9/10):\r\nThis isn't a movie that you can take on anytime, any day under any circumstances, otherwise, a lot might fly by and the core message will get lost past your thoughts, I know it was the deal with me once, despite its short length, it packs up many crushing facts about the world and growing up, life is bittersweet on both sides and this movie was on point showing that off.\n"

            "content": "\n                Just like many of his very vague looking works, but with really deep meanings to them, this is yet another short by Yutaro Kubo, under the title of \u201cCrazy for it\u201d, just the name of the creator should be enough to build up an image on the visuals you're going to be getting, this is a special kind of shorts, where the viewer's attention is highly required, the art can serve as both eye candy, very entertaining and very relaxing to look at, but also is a dangerous distraction, you can't tell if it's done by purpos or not, but the catch and the moralof the story ought to be hidden and/or at least not easily caught on, that way, the viewer is rewarded for understanding the signs that not a lot of the viewers even noticed at the end of the short.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nThis a story about redemption, about knowing what's like to fail but never giving in to failure, a story about hardships and overcoming them. It all starts when a male figure stars directing at you, knowing that the only thing that visually separates the both of you is a screen, which could also refer to as a mirror, in order words, you're looking at yourself, the author wants you to think of that person as yourself, he wants you to experience something relatable, something we all at some point or another went/will go through, the figure starts off by washing their face, indicating that they just woke up, then immediately gets ready to brush their teeth, as soon as they toothpast makes contact with their teeth, the visuals change completely, showing some abstracts of someone running towards something, the author wants you to think of it as you following a dream, running down the path of life so intensly acomanied by a heavy color swapping, which could indicate immotions, the figure would struggle time to time, collapsing and then standing back again to complete its run with nothing stopping it, filled with a lot of energy and compassion.\r\nAt some point, tall structures begin to grow, with the figure voices them back and forth, those are the struggles that would stop one's dreams and pull them into depression, we see the figure's hand open up to the horizon, that could symbolize hope, and the nearby reward for a great effort, the figure continues running until we're back to the same guy brushing his teeth like nothing happened, now, was that all his imagination? Was he day-dreaming? Was he thinking about the distant goal? Maybe it was all about the journey of the toothpaste being rubbed on his teeth, no matter it was, our character has a life to live, he has dreams, he has things to look forward too, after all, we all do.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nThe short consisted of multiple sketches, abstractly colored, there was often a change of the style in both the animation and art, the use of colors was very strong in some parts, but completely absent in others, they emphasized certain emotions perfectly, it was so amazing how a sudden change of style can really make something stand up from the others, like the human anatomy figures used in complicated dance poses.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nVery fast paced, was suitable to the animation, it blended well with the motion and backgrounds, nothing major remarkable, it was amazing to see how multiple instruments were used to achieve a certain \u201chype\u201d for few moments, like how the track started very simple, to only get complicated as the short progressed to only fade out at the end.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nThe main protagonist, who feels like a teenage adult that gives you that relatable vibe about him, you can see how calm he is, casually doing is morning routine, till we enter his mind, where we see how he wildly thinks, and he pictures aspects of life, and how compassionate he is.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nWhat really brought me here is another of Yutaro Kubo works, \u201c00:08\u201d, another fantastic piece of art, my main satisfaction was with the relaxing feel of the visuals and music, the catch behind the short wasn't half bad either.\n\r\n- Overall (8/10):\r\nYes, it is another of those \u201cnot-for-everyone\u201d movies, I would recommend this to the more mature type of viewers, the ones that are looking for something realistic and relatable.\n"

Bundled with the limited edition of High School DxD DX.2. It tells the story of Issei helping out Phenex, a past villain into getting over his fear of dragons. With the help of Tannin, they go on a journey to the mountains with Ravel accompanying them.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nNot the proudest production inthe franchise but still watchable. The weather particles blend nicely with the night sky backgrounds. The animation, for the most part, was decent and not distracting at all.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nAgain, props the production team for reusing the old great soundtrack, also leaving out the opening and ending theme songs was just what I wanted, great songs by the way.\r\nThe voice acting was okay, and ridiculous too how the can keep screaming perverted non-sense at either other, while probably maintaining a straight face, glorious.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nI put a score as high as I can without having to break my unbiased reviewing this, we get to see the return of a probably one of the m\u00f9ost hated characters in the series, Phenex from the first season who challenged Rias to a rating game to decide whether they get married or not.\r\nThis time around, we got to see a side of Phenex we never had the pleasure to see, really cool and funny guy, dependable and powerful as well, and oddly enough, sharing the same affection as our protagonist. If anything, he could make for a great big brother to Issei.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nQuite a fun watch, I never thought I would like Phenex, I never bothered with him from the get-go, he was just another character that was destined to fade away, but not really, he proved to be a solid well-written character that has more to offer in the future.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nI would definitely recommend this over other OVAs and specials for what it offers of comedy and character development for Phenex. and before you ask, yes, there's immense fanservice as well, so warm up your seat and start the episode.\n"

I would genuinely start off every episode with very low expectations almost looking down on the series that I would end up looking up just like Boa Hancock, however, a certain charm that comes with this show manages to convert my disappointment grin to a genuinely happy face at the end of every episode, and it wasn't toolong before I just gave up and approved the show to be that of a high quality, a show that stands up high among many, which is rarely the case in my experience.\r\nThe Rom-Com genre is always present every season but only rarely comes a show that excels at adapting the source material and preserving the identity of plot whilst nailing what makes an Anime successful and accessible. \u201cKaguya-sama love is war\u201d doesn't just nail that, it makes you begging for more shows on the same quality and sets off a high roof for other shows to follow, it was one big fest of historically insane laughter, a rollercoaster that smasher your tiny pathetic heart into pieces as it waters your eyes as if it was a plant, all in the same episode when you least expect it. It has deffintelety found its identity this season and gained a lot of following from both its OG fans and a lot of newer ones, and what enabled most of that was its unique concept of romance that was probably its biggest selling point.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nWhat can be described as a select of episodic consequences of actions which also have a big relational feel to them as several plot point can bring up past happenings, a race between two brilliant students that everybody looks up to on who will confess first, and no, it's not a delicate game of chess either, both of them fabricate all sorts of strategies to lead the other one into submission, while every day has its victor, sometimes it just doesn't work for either.\r\nI'm sure we've all seen our fair share of rom-com shows to conclude that what this show, in particular, is one of a class, never have I seen a series with the same take, turning a desirable feeling (love) into an intense challenge that can create a lot of opportunities for comedy in the meantime.\r\nThe show feeds heavily on pop culture references, intense fights between two brains and strategies that can overthrow a country. It also tackles small elements of friendship and family, two themes that work together and are very relatable to most of us.\r\nIt is safe to excuse the fast pace of the storytelling as all episodes will end up focusing on up to three mini-stories all self-contained while still relating to the main goal of the plot which is a point because comedy shows can get a bit too daunting and repetitive if they took a slower route.\r\nIt seems that even a show that has comedy of all things as a priority, the plot kept hinting at a lot of deeper concepts you never saw coming, most of them are from backstories of the main cast, the like of which deserve a standalone series.\n\r\nArt (8.8/10):\r\nWe never ask for the latest animation practices or the most fluid frame technology usage when it comes to shows that are not that concerned about their visual quality, but that was exactly what we got nevertheless, and you know what? That's a welcomed surprise.\r\nThe character design of all things looks very generic and slice-of-life-ish but it was the animation, the sudden dramatic background changes and the unfamiliar camera positioning that highlighted a lot of the motion than was needed.\r\nSome of the minor scenes ended up looking very clean and fluid it got a lot of people's attention just for that, a two-minute short dance which very slick movement's that I'm sure was traced on top of a real performer which only helped its fluidity and consistency.\r\nThe color palette remained all bright and appealing to the eye, a lot of emphasis on primary colors that only get darker as the tone of the show shifts to something more serious.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe overall performance was, great, just what's needed to not have you bash on the vocal quality of the show. As dramatic as some portions were, the voice acting felt just natural to deliver the same emotions spoken from the characters that it seems very believable and with no room for cringe-worthy performances.\r\nBoth the opening and the ending were so good they called up along the more popular shows of the season securing their own place in those popular Anime song quizzes with ease.\r\nThe soundtrack was suiting to the overall tone of the show, blending so much that it's not noticeable anymore, but it's there to highlight the other vocal element like voice acting and dramatic win blowing sound effects.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nIn most similar entries of the same genre, the characters seem pretty interchangeable and not all that \u201cof a depth\u201d, there is going to be a vast selection of waifus and husbandos of course, a lot of figures will be favorites that get talked about all the time but that doesn't mean they are that well-written carrier of the plot precisely.\r\nAside from Kaguya, which has her name in the title along with other well distinguishable facial features like her red eyes that are viewed as a special trademark in the run of the show, every other character is so plain looking that they end up like shallow mannequins looking common side character trope, not going to lie, Shirogane, a crucial figure to the story as a protagonist can easily be lost between a crown of background characters which is not specifically the point from a show of this genre.\r\nAnother horribly written abomination is Chika, she's got a huge fan following behind her from performing a certain dance at the early stages of the show and to be honest, a doll in a puppet show looks way more interesting than her empty childish head and twisted nature of screwing up a handful of great moment which I guess had a hand in creating good humor, but compared to the other cast, she was just an abused punching bag of a comic relief that we really didn't need in a show that especially focuses on comedy as one of the main factors of its storytelling.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI think I've stressed what I really thought and ended up thinking about the series, what started as an old close minded fella with a closed mentality that bashed every aspect of the show ended up cheering for a second adaptation. I'd always have a respectable amount of a good time on every episode no matter how straight my face was at the moment I hit play on the episodes, the humor was hilarious, the sad moments were very down and gloomy and with a lot of sense behind them.\r\nA generous amount of humor comes from the narrator himself that breaks down the fourth wall on multiple occasion making the viewer even closer to the scenery portrayed.\n\r\nOverall (8.26/10):\r\nThis is one definitive recommendation from me, and I'm sure a lot of people do agree with me here. Without a doubt, it has some minor problems that can easily be ignored without sacrificing what makes the show unique and worthy of your time.\n"

            "content": "\n                As shocked you'd be hearing it, and believe me, I would have never expected myself to say such a thing, this is an extreme harem/ecchi with a solid plot, this is a great sequel, this is a plot involving tale. I know it's hard to believe, nudity is everywhere, but I feel that the first season did its trick on us, and gave us our share of fanservice only to let us focus on the plot later with no distractions.\r\nHigh School DxD New improves on its prequel on so many levels, it's no longer about nasty perverted stuff, although that's what dragged us into theseries in the first place, this story turned out to be with a more involving plot that we might have anticipated.\n\r\n- Story (8.7/10):\r\nThe first season was really weak in terms of storytelling, we got introduced to the three major factions yes, we did have the first club members introduced, I know, but it really was just a mess out of fanservice that didn't know when to end.\r\nHigh School DxD New gave more attention to telling the actual story while also retaining a controllable amount of fanservice. in this second installment of the franchise we get to see more light spots on various characters, their origins, and motives, their dreams and relationships.\r\nAlso, this time around, a more greater danger was approaching, and even more worldbuilding was made in terms of villains, allies. I would actually, finnaly be true to myself, and call Highschool DxD a good story with an insane lore ranking slightly below other amazing titles,  such as One Piece and No Game No Life.\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\r\nNot the most amazing thing to say the least, but not as bad either, it certainly is better by a small margin than that of the first season but not so much noticeable.\r\nWhat can I say really, in terms of anatomy, the female's are just as much or even more erotic that I can remember, I know you're in for some exciting body bumps, so have some high hopes, you won't be let down.\r\nThe animation was decent, really, nothing compares to a high budget movie production, but there is really nothing that would make you go; \u201cEww\u201d or anything.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThe installment had its share of amazing sound-work, the soundtracks are the same ones from the first season, and those were just spectacular, so no complaints here.\r\nThe thing I wasn't quite pleasant here is the existent of 2 opening theme songs for a mere 12 episodes of content, while the first opening theme song was just amazing, very catchy (but not as good as the first season's), the second one didn't quite click to me. The ending theme songs were also great, especially the last one.\r\nThe voice acting here remains as one of a high quality, I can't pick one above the other here, you get the feminine tone of voice when the females speak something erotic and also get intense performances on their respective moments.\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\r\nThis is character development at its finest, I would even argue that great series like Fullmetal Alchemist and the likes of it pale in comparison, this is definitely a trophy winner.\r\nWe get to meet a lot of cool characters in this season, surprisingly not only females but male characters, speaking about the great Azazel, such a cool design, and personality.\r\nBack to our old character, take Kiba for instance, I would say, he got the most focus of this season, probably the most developed character in the series so far. I would bet that if there was somebody who didn't give Kiba any credits of attention at first would change his or her minds now that we got his backstory. The same can be told about Akeno that also had some play time here.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.4/10):\r\nI'm being very honest here, I really liked this series, I never got this kind of feeling while watching a harem or ecchi before, those were to me like more of a pleasure and giggles than actual enjoyment, but this is a game changer, my balance breaker.\r\nI got everything I wanted with extra, I really dug the story, and for that alone, I'd attempt to rewatch the whole series sometime in the future.\r\nI enjoyed the characters way more in this season, they had a depth to themselves, especially the ones that didn't have that much focus on the first season.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nI've always been skeptical about recommending Harem/Ecchi series to friends, but not anymore, or at least, not with this one. I'm really thankful to that one guy who recommended this series, I didn't know I needed this at first, but it was a hell(pun intended) of a good watch. Yes, I would definitely recommend watching this if you've already seen the first season if you didn't enjoy the first that much, this one is absolutely an improvement that has more quality and distance between it and the first season than the iPhone smartphone brands.\n"

I'm sure we all know what a complex show Psycho-pass can get, from the emotion to the hype it all ties up very nicely, It's so perfect in fact that some of us might think a sequel would most definitely nor deliver the promise of the original season, most of the people are turned down very disappointed after seeing the second season, while this movie is a sequel to itself, it wouldbe worth mentioning that you can still get away watching it without having to see the second season, literally.\r\nBut the question, remains, does it deliver? let's find that out...\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nThe story takes place 3 years after the events of the second season of the show, while it's a sequel as I said before, it does not require knowing what happens during the second season, it's completely independent, and relies on more of the events of the first season.\r\nThe focus of the story shifts back yet again to Akane being involved in a large scale investigation concerning Kougami and what he's been up to all these years, the con, foundations, and conclusions really worth it, and the progression keeps you on your toes the whole time.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nSeriously, what's not to like about this? it's the exact same animation and art concept of the show, only a hundred times better, the animations, in particular, feel a lot more smooth and appealing, I mean, just notice the facial expressions, and even vocals and face muscles movements, that's some crazy insane stuff.\r\nThe anatomy couldn't' have been done better, and the CG scenes aren't as bad as I remember them in the show, truly a work of art.\r\nThe brutal scenarios do look gruesome and even more disturbing, and the fight scenes are just, ugh, spot on.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nNothing to complain about here, It's not even a month ago that I finished watching both seasons, and having heard the original soundtrack once again, filled be with constant nostalgia, but the real star of the party was the voice acting, ugh, they cast deserves a trophy on this one.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nA lot of familiar faces were brought on in this one, but there were also new people to take into consideration, Kougami, for instance, is just as cool as you remember him to be, easy going, and the typical guy that's steps ahead of his targets, and let's give some credits to our antagonist, the mercenary guy, who really gave Koygami and Akane a run on their money, big time, that was quite the challenge to take down.\r\nWhat really cuts off the cake, was seeing how Kougami reacts to Akane's growth and development, really reminds you of how far she's gotten.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nMan, it's been a while since I last saw a good movie sequel, total worth seeing for other times to come.\r\nfinishing this will only put you in the mood for a third season, which I hope would live up to the legacy of the first season, Kamui was cool, but we need some Makishima's awesomeness.\n\r\n- Overall (8.4/10):\r\nI would definitely recommend this pick, even more so than I would for the second season, no hate tho, bot ha great, but this movie, is just quality production, sets off a high ceiling for other shows to  come, if you're ready to have some great action, here's a good movie to keep your company, have fun!\n"

Well, I bet anyone should at least wash their faces after watching this movie because God does it lure you out of reality, no kidding, such a great movie, the music and the visuals, the excellent storytelling, it was more than enough to teleport me from my room to the story's world, the journey was so atmospheric and engaging, probably the best Ghibli film I've ever seen, and man it would be a great deal if Iwould ever watch and acknowledge another movie to top this one, and yes, I am one to not be satisfyied that easily, usually you would see me complain about the tiniest of things, but in this movie's case, I'm so about to explode expressing my satisfaction that I won't probably have time or energy to mention anything bad, but hey, this is a review, and stating the both is a must, let's get this overdone.\n\r\n- Story (9.5/10):\r\nOh, Wai-wai-wait, before you attack me, yes, this is a bit rude and poorly rated, I kept bragging about how the story was fantastic and marvelous, yes, I get it, but, it really still missed that half a point that it had at the beginning, think about it, I would have loved to see this as a series rather than it being a movie, with the approximately 2 hours length, it still felt short, and somewhat rushed on some parts of the story, there has been so much to be shown and told, but a movie has got a limited time to conlclude itself, and eventually it did, but hey, it still made it to 9.5 scores, that's something you don't see too much noadays, a well-structured story, pure and with no plot-holes is already a great thing to ask about, this is on the surface a story about innocent love, an adventure about facing your fears, and sacrificing everything for your loved ones, a story that teaches that beauty is not mandatory, and love doesn't rule by it, love is about something more, admiration comes from observing others, seeing in them qualities that we lack, that makes us utterly happy, looking a Howl, even though he has beauty, and can perform magic so magnificeantly, he was till empty, just an escapie fearing to face his past, his mistakes that he's long run from, and there came Sofie, a young girl that's not happy with how she looks and doesn't know a darn thing about magic, the two looked at eachother, they grew more closed, as Howl seen her as an old hag, and she saw him as a coward, they learnt from their mistakes and tought eachother that they can be something more, achieve greater happyness with eachother, and thus, the happy ending they craved about, was their reward, that was a short lookup on the sutface of the story, but that's not all that it was about, there were a lot of hidden so-called-side-stories contained within the main plot, like for example, the horror of war, the weakness of being old, the strong presence of social classes, and the weakness of the poor infront the might of the rich, how poor towns were attacked so oftn, and how rich parts of the country were a paradise in comparation, there was the family appoach that was presented in a very ironic way, where we see Sofie's real family acting all care-free, and all about money and status, which her made-up family shared her her happy moments, love and despare.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nOh yeas, written like a piece of cake, someone should contact the developers in this website, and tell them to add a higher rank for these special nominees, if there was an Oscar for this type of things, then hurry up, what are you waiting for, this 2004 movie that not only has better animation, art, and aesthetics than 90% of the current monthly spam of new franchises, it also sets a ceiling to other famous Ghibli films and work of arts, about 70% of the scenes that if paused, can make for incredible wallpaper material, the backgrounds and how they blend with eveything, the lighting, just oooh, I kind you not when I say, that this eye candy is so uplifting that it makes you wish you were there, present, feeling the wind gently tapping your skin, smelling the fresh flowers, interacting with the people in the background, it's truly a wonderland, and weirdly enough, that includes the scary places too, there is something very immersive with this Ghibli art, that I wouldn't have thought of anything more worthy of suiting such a rich story. What was really exciting to see, and even pause and stare at for few moments, those amazing landscapes, the oily looking streets, the food aesthetics, and most importantly, the mechanic structures, like for instance, Howl's castle, with its rusty parts and the strong Victorian age feel that sourrounds it, thouse simple shaky flying crafts, and the giant battleships, although looking very strange and out of this world, they really reflect what people were thinking about aircraft when they were first invented, you really can feel the environment and immerse with it.\n\r\n- Sound (10/10):\r\nDeserves every praise as the art, the soundtracks were very lively and engaging in their own way, sometimes they were quiet, other times, they were more strong and present that the visuals were, whenever there was a wholesome moment, it was escorted with the most fitting track you can hear, the dangerous moments were so emphasised by their respective sound effects, and don't get me started on how amazing the voice acting was, you can almost see the characters spitting their emotions while speaking, you could tell how impactful something was for them just by how vivid their voice sound, and no that's not all, there were those silent moments where them being so quiete made it even more impactful and solid, the way how they soundtracks where transitioned was handled amazingly, you can tell how talented the people who were behind this were.\n\r\n- Character (9/10):\r\nIt would have been even more perfect if it wasn't for the clich\u00e9 settings when it came to characters, it really reminds you of the old Disney characters, but in a unique another way, it felt more mature and grounded, like for instance, Sofie, being turned into an old woman, with her new weak body, she did keep her young rational personality, but her weak body had a strong role in containing her down, stopping her from doing crazy stuff, helped her feel more responsible, until we noticed that her personatily changed to match her grown body, let's talk about Howl's development, how he went from running to fighting, it was a long way from suffering from depression, but it sure paid off, and let's not overlook the initial villain figure, the witch hag, she at the end learnt her lesson the hard way, become more forgiving and sharing, it wasn't much at the beginign, but her burden help somehow strengthen the bonds of their family.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI, as someone who enjoyed works with more than just vague action, did find this two hours of animation amazing, one of the best movies I've seen, if not already the best, being the sucker for great animation and soundtracks, I had my share of satisfaction, being the type of guy who loved discovering the environment of the story, being engaged with the events, I sure did receive more than I was expecting.\n\r\n- Overall (9.7/10):\r\nI'm so ashamed to not give it a complete 10 out of 10, I sure will feel bad about it for the upcoming days, I would have never expected myself to be this much attached to the story, this was a great movie, no, a masterpiece even, and there isn't that much in the domain, would I recommend this? Absolutely and with no hesitation, for you all, romance, adventure, mystery fans, here's a hidden gem for you to enjoy.\n"

You know already, this is either a miss or hit, nothing in between.\r\nAlicization started very strong and great, setting up new hights which sadly ended up partially abandoning them in War of Underworld, and again, spoiler alert, did not remain faithful to the first Alicization season and continued messing around with anything good it had going for it.\r\nLet me elaborate.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nThe half-baked plot of this season resolves the entire Alicization saga, or it appeared to do so until the last horrible 5 minutes of the show which completely changedthe subjective rating of the whole Alicization arc.\r\nThe pace shifted from mildly slow to fast action paced battle royal as soon as Kirito came back to the spotlight.\r\nI, however, liked how some previous loose ends of the plot were utilized and brought back to play a role in this season like Akihiko.\n\r\nArt (8.8/10):\r\nIf anything, this series only knows an increase in visual production thanks to anything else. Just like the previous Alicization seasons, the particle effects are incredible, way ahead of most modern shows and movies.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nAgain, the OSTs in this season were incredible, even more so than the animation. The opening and the ending songs are also S class, truly living to the name of SAO when it comes to bangers.\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\r\nThe only character that seemed to have developed was Alice, the rest, not so much. The villain got some backstory that accompanies you through what made him the way he is, cool call back to season one as well and how Kirito related to him indirectly.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nNo matter the flaws, no matter how bad the situation turns out to be, SAO was never the show that defines the blueprint for storytelling, it does what it sets up to do, doesn't make up impossible promises, it's just there for the OG fans to enjoy which is what makes it bearable the most.\n\r\nOverall (7.76/10):\r\nI mean, the same thing is said about every other SAO season, you've already made it out here, why stop now? Season 2 was subjectively where the show hit its lowest low, it doesn't get any lower than that, so no matter how bad this season is, it still has a lot of redeeming quality, if anything, the visuals and the angelic soundtracks make the most of what it's worth.\n"

The Arizona state prison, home of the unchained, it felt like a long time coming ever since the OG 2ng season of Baki, it's definitely a milestone, and it shows.\n\r\nIf there is anything this season nails on the head is the artistic direction, it feels like the Manga panels are coming alive, so little CG reliance that it's not even noticeable, and a lot of beautifully choreographed muscle play. The dialog is as hilarious as ever, and the disrespect from multiple parts has never been so humiliating and intense.\n\r\nThe doesn't even try to highlight Baki as a deep character at this point, and if you've returned just to get some of that then you're 3 seasons late into realization. However, I must say, it does not shy from spotlighting other side characters. It was definitely Oliva's season and it didn't stop there.\n\r\nBaki is as wacky as ever, if not, more so than it ever was, starting with shadow fighting, to whatever happened at the end, it is definitely loyal to Itagaki's vision on what ever orgy he's writing.\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\n"

The character designs are hot, like I want a whole series around Mujina hot.\n\r\nSSSS.Dynazenon, where do I even begin? It's like Tsuburaya Productions said \"Hey, let's take the already epic SSSS.Gridman, add in some giant robots and a cast of characters that are so quirky and endearing, you'll never want them to leave.\" And that's exactly what they did. The character designs alone are enough to make you fall in love, but when you add in a storyline that's both heartwarming and bittersweet, you've gota winner.\n\r\nLet's talk about the main character, Yomogi. Normally I'd roll my eyes at a high school student being the hero, but not in this case. He's got more heart and soul than most people twice his age, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked him. And don't even get me started on Gauma, Yume, and Koyomi, the dynamic between the entire cast is just fantastic. The Eugenicists as villains may not have been the most interesting storyline, but as separate cast members, they were so full of life and personality, it was like watching fireworks go off.\n\r\nThe blend of 2D and 3D animation was just perfect, considering this is a kaiju show, and it was executed so well. I mean, it's not like I expected anything less from Tsuburaya Productions. The opening and ending songs were like SSSS.Gridman's, but in a good way. And the voice acting, oh my gosh, it was like they were born to voice these characters, they brought the key moments to life.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the character development, it was so noticeable, especially for a 12-episode-long show. It's like they took all my favorite coming-of-age stories and packed them into this little gem. I never thought I'd find myself so invested in a kaiju show, but here we are. My love for kaiju has been unexpectedly lit on fire, and I'm forever a changed man.\n\r\nSo, if you're looking for a show that's both hilarious and heartwarming, with a cast of characters that will steal your heart, look no further than SSSS.Dynazenon. Trust me, you won't regret it.\n\r\nOverall: 7.7/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Gag series are quite a handful to keep up with, they are all about the jokes, logic and common sense don't have to apply, they never hold back into diving into fantasies and referencing pop culture icons, each one of those rules of thumb is hard enough to nail as an individual aspect of making up a solid series, but Space\u2606Dandy hammers each one of them like a professional, baby.\n\n\r\nStory (8.5/10):\r\nWhat's really flexible about similar shows is that they don't have to follow a linear storyline to be called a proper show with its ups and downs, this is literally like a youtuber from the2016-2018 era, today's' video is a vlog, and tomorrow's is a let's play, it's all about the variety of content and emitting repetition, there is a special appreciation that goes along with starting up a new episode almost from scratch, not knowing what it will be about, probably the last one was all cheery and happy, but nothing is stopping this one to be different, a little more about a sad backstory or a depressing turn of events, baby.\n\r\nlooking from a very 3rd person view, a trio of weirdos composed of an intelligent vacuum cleaner looking robot named QT whose chips have grown dated, a talking cat alien that draws a lot from the modern definition of otaku. We're talking about an obsession with social media, Anime styled games, and of course, likes his fair share of boobies. And finally and more importantly, the dandiest man in space, space dandy, with his marvelous Elvis-influenced hairstyle and his unique taste in clothing, a respected slave of the booty and a regular at the galactic restaurant called \u201cBoobies\u201d, along they spend their days hunting down rare alien species for a living, baby.\n\r\nIt sounds simple enough, but don't let that fool you into thinking that they have one definitive goal at the end of the day, yes, they may be alien hunters (That sounds badass), but they are not tied to an end goal, all they want is to drop by \u201cBoobies\u201d and have a sweet glass of beer at the end of a hard hunting day, nothing like saving the world or delivering on a prophecy matters here, baby.\n\r\nThere were some unfortunate drawbacks on its episodic serialization, while some episodes were just phenomenal, you could almost flesh out an entire seasonal series out of that amazing 24 minutes of content into its own standalone plotline if you wanted to. Some other episodes (Only one to be more precise) were a bit bad directed, their concept was just amazing, no, probably one of the best concepts presented in this series, but it just didn't have the best direction and storyboarding to compliment it. And let me tell you, some episodes were the best I've seen in any entertainment medium, baby.\n\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nThere is something mysterious that always scream of \u201cAmerican\u201d when you put space and Elvis into a mix, not only on paper but they managed to carry on that ideology on the artwork as well, I believe that I had trained my eyes enough for it to confidently tell an Anime and a cartoon apart, and I still can't spot anything that tells me this show was not some ordinary American cartoon aside from it being labeled as an Anime. Which is not a bad thing, baby.\n\r\nDuring the fast-paced action-packed scenes, the animation looked surreal, so fluid and tasty to the eye you would beg for your eyes to be stuck on an eternal loop on that same exact scene, to think that this degree of amazing Saguka would work with an art style like this and with a perfect juxtaposition too, baby.\n\n\r\nSound (9.5/10):\r\nNow, before we get controversial, I've watched the DUB version and let me tell you, and I have taken a closer look to both versions, but the DUB here blows the SUB by a large margin, I mean, it's not even close.\r\nThe SUB version is decent, on the same level of every other SUBed show, however, the DUB was just godly, and you can only feel the animation look more solid being handled by an English voice acting, it just works so well.\r\nMost of the jokes have a strange western vibe to them so it only feels more natural to hear them in DUB rather than to read them as subtitles, baby.\n\r\nThe soundtracks were phenomenal, those buttle fluid frames? Oh, they look even better when you layer the soundtrack on top of them, it's like the same thing with Cowboy Bebop all over again, something so retro about them that make them work in this setting, and oh boy do they vary, there are the hyperactive ones for action moments, the sad ones for the gloomy moments, I mean, there are even ones that sound flirty by nature that go so well with Dandy's pickup lines, baby.\n\r\nNot to be harsh on the opening and ending sequences as they are only being spoken about this late. I can't stress this enough.\r\nThe DUBed version of the show had two opening sequences due to some strange reason, the original opening sequence was only used until halfway through the series, as the first one was never used in the subbed version, and that's where I have to stack up for my boys, both of them were amazing. They sounded so simplistic and boy do they put you in the spirit, baby.\n\n\r\nCharacter (8.5/10):\r\nObviously, this isn't a character heavy plot that relies on edge cutting character development or anything of that nature. There are some guys that honestly relate to most of the audience despite being from a distant future were memes actually still a thing (Confirmed by QT), this is a show about the gags and the jokes, and those guys are supposed to be like those guys you want to hang out with, they are likable and that was the point.\r\nDespite the trio being so incompatible with one another, they always find some way to interact like buddies to give you the impression that they mean more than family to each other where they are most of the time ready to kiss each other goodbye for good on life-threatening moments, baby.\n\r\nSomething that really set this show apart from anything I've watched, is that even the narrator felt more of the main character than most of the off-screened naruto characters from the hidden leaf. The dude sounded so chill, often broke the fourth wall and even contributed in steering down the action in the show, and it was glorious, baby.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nThere is a lot to like about this series, and too little to hate unless you just want to nitpick every mico-sized flaw there is.\r\nA lot of people would complain about the bad pacing of the series or at sometimes, the lack of action, but really, not every episode is going to be about skyscraper-sized robots exchanging epic blows, the varying mini-stories were just the best, from referencing the astronaut doggo Laika to a very wholesome family-centered episode with Meow. It just felt home being in front from the screen while watching the Aloha Oe (The name of their spaceship) crew rocking it up, baby.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nFirst of all, sorry about the excessive use of \u201cbaby\u201d to end every paragraph, that was just my tribute to the series, and will probably do the same when I review the second season.\r\nThis was one show that I never knew would make me beg for more, and to my luck, there is already a second season. A really underrated comedy centered Anime series, it really is heavy on satire and ridicule it definitely deserves the time of every comedy fanatic out there, even if they weren't into Anime, baby.\n"

With this one being more canon than the other, as well as a showdown of the animation work of the new studio that's taking over the production of season 4.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nI personally liked the way this ending took root more, it made a lot more sense and used some past plot points to justify the yet ridiculous conclusion. What I liked, even more, is the minimalistic fanservice here, the lack of fanservice really helped to get the viewers to focus on what's going on, whichdid make the confrontation and Issei's transformation more emotional. But the rest still was low on effort and quality.\n\r\n- Art (6.5/10):\r\nI think that this might be the downfall in regards to the animation, the colors are more vibrant and attractive, but the art style just doesn't work with Hich School DxD, we used to have sharp edges and hard colors, but everything looks soft and out of proportions, for instance, Asia looks like she suddenly grew a cup size or something.\r\nSometimes faces look very ugly and unappealing, the really screwed the face features mapping this time.\n\r\n- Sound (6.0/10):\r\nI give this low score mainly because of the poor auditions, the voice acting felt so blunt and forced, like when Issei screams, he sounds like his voice actor was doing his last recording for the day after 20 hours of none stop work, very tired and lazy. And what doesn't stop only at Issei!\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\r\nAgain, which the poor character design,n this art style just doesn't deliver the old nostalgic vibe of the previous series. I even struggled to recognize some of the characters due to the staggering change they went through.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI know I've stated so many flaws, but I still enjoyed what I've seen for what it was, I like me some High School DxD every once and a while, and this one did deliver, even though barely.\n\r\n- Overall (6.5/10):\r\nI wouldn't highly recommend this, but it could serve as a good startup to get your a bit familiar with the nex animation and direction, and also, to make you reconsider your hype for the 4th season.\r\nAlthough, it's not that necessary, and is very skippable.\n"

A character I never liked but never disliked either has managed to level up in my eyes like I never expected. Remember the busted Foxy? From the Davy Back fight arc, yes, he makes a come back, and this time, as a dependable ally, something I never asked for, but surprisingly welcomed with open arms.\r\nWe get to see more of him as a captain for his crew, his dynamic and the respect his crew hold towards him, it was precious.\n"

Before the modern Gundam spread was a thing, going back to the root of the classic display of brutal punch exchange between a heroic giant robot at corner A, and a barbaric Kaiju roaring a cornerB. A 90's theme song would play in the background as the hero speaks of his flashily named power moves that are often mixed with ordinary wrestling technique, fighting for justice on a battle that spans across multiple scyscrappers wide.\r\nSSSS.Gridman is by its very core, a modern shot at the classic Godzilla-Mecha fest which doesn't sacrifice a drop of the expected clich\u00e9 moment that pretty much became a defining aspect of the mesh. But at a good price.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nTo be honest, when it comes to similar shows, a ground-breaking isn't what you should be looking for, or expecting at the very least. It's all about the hardcore metal collisions that shake skyscrapers, as common sense and deep thinking has no place in making a bad Godzilla massacre better or a good one bad. And I'm not trying to say that there is not a single entry that managed to have both aspects going for it, it's just not a very critical rule of thumb that matters in these type of shows anyway.\r\nMy biggest problem with the story was how horribly scattered everything was. They would drop some vital information on you that gets you to ask questions but never bother to address it or explain it afterward like you're supposed to get the meaning behind everything yourself. Pardon me, but I didn't know I was staring at a Picasso abstract when I first signed in.\n\r\n- Art (8.8/10):\r\nI would have increased my rating on this a bit higher, but it seems that decent CGI could only get you so far.\r\nI absolutely am not a fan of heavy use of CGI in Anime, and my greatest fear before stepping into this territory was just that. It doesn't get more classic than expecting heavy reliance of CGI in mecha related shows for how complicated it might get to animate everything and tie it up together, but God blesses SSSS.Gridman's animation team for the phenomenal job they did to sell the series, at least visually.\r\nThe normal 2D artwork direction was just as fantastic if dare I say better, I love the color pallet, and even more so the gloomy atmosphere and complicated and messy backgrounds.\r\nThe character designs were gorgeous, aside from Utsumi who looked as generic as you can get. All the Kaiju and Gridman action, on the other hand, was definitely the highlight, to see a skyscraper-size hand swing so swiftly and heavily until it messes a Kaiju's face making you feel the impact as if you took the punch instead. The use of complicated particles and VFX all over the place really helped blend in 2D and 3D nicely together. If anything, this might have been able to cure my ever-loving fear of CGI in Anime. And for that, I thank you, Gridman.\n\r\n- Sound (7.8/10):\r\nLet's get this out of the way. I never wowed hearing the opening song of the show until later in the series, maybe I had to get used to it, but no. I just wasn't ready to handle the epicness it had. I take its frequent use in the big fights a key to that. Sadly lyn I don't say much for the ending song, and I'm and ending song man.\r\nWith that off the way, I can finally appreciate the voice acting.\r\nI thought the voice acting cast was decent in general, but God did I enjoy Akane and Rikka's performances, I don't know how, but those two make it work somehow, for the critical roles they take in this show, they sure were the right pick for whatever roles they handled.\n\r\n- Character (6/10):\r\nNot going to lie, I'm very disappointed in how the characters turned out to be. Yuta the main character, wait, did somebody say the main character? I literally mean it when I say that he had nothing that screams \u201cmain\u201d character in him aside from his visual design. The same goes for every other main character.\r\nIt's like they trying so hard to be relatable and strike a likable trope, I'm sorry, I couldn't relate, maybe other people did, but that was just my personal experience with them.\r\nAkane was an interesting choice of a character to the extent of me considering her the real protagonist behind the curtains.\r\nMaybe the reason behind that is that they try to pair up an older structured character \u201cGridman\u201d with a more modern bunch of 21-century teenagers, call me gatekeeping, but Gridman's enthusiastic heroic boi didn't match very well the emo-edgelord group of characters.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nLet's be honest, crappy it may be, I could never hate my punch-porn worth of seasonal overhyped fest. I need it in my life.\r\nYuta was never that great of a protagonist, or a character as a matter of fact, but he and everybody else helped deliver a blood rushing action-packed Kaiju kicking simulator. I really appreciate its attempt to take on similar vibes like FLCL, but no matter how hard it failed, it blessed us with a phenomenal episode that I'm sure to rewatch as a standalone episode on my free time.\n\r\n- Overall (7.12/10):\r\nI would probably recommend this, not for how game-changing it was, but for how really fun it stood for what it is. I would want to enjoy a city buster with a friend or two, there is no shame in that, ugh, also, don't forget the famous tights this show has gathered the attention on about.\n"

As some of you might not know, in the Manga, Vivi wore a shirt of different pattern that had explicit circles that exploits some sexuality, so they had to change that on the original Anime adaptation, but it seems they didn't bother with that here and had her wear that questionable shirt instead. And talking about sexuality, all the females look to have gained a cup size upgrade to an overwhelming extent.\n"

            "content": "\n                \"Zom 100: Zombie ni Naru made ni Shitai 100 no Koto\" is an intriguing anime that blends the mundanity of corporate life with the excitement of a zombie apocalypse. The series starts with Akira Tendou, a young man who, after graduating from a prestigious university and joining an exploitative company, finds his life turned upside down when he wakes up to a world overrun by zombies. This unexpected twist provides Akira with a liberation of sorts from his soul-crushing job, prompting him to create a bucket list of things to do before potentially turning into a zombie himself.\n\r\nThe anime's premise is both its greatest strengthand its potential weakness. On the one hand, it offers a unique twist on the zombie genre, moving away from the typical survival narrative to focus on a character who sees the apocalypse as a form of freedom. This approach allows for a blend of playful horror and comedy, as well as an exploration of the themes of freedom and the pursuit of happiness in the direst circumstances. On the other hand, this very uniqueness might also be its downfall, as some viewers might find the mix of corporate satire and zombie apocalypse a bit jarring.\n\r\nThe animation quality of \"Zom 100\" is noteworthy. Studio BUG FILMS has done a commendable job, creating fluid and expressive scenes that enhance the viewing experience. The use of color is particularly striking, with a palette that contrasts the typical dark tones of zombie narratives with more vibrant hues, reflecting the anime's blend of horror and comedy.\n\r\nSound design and music are also highlights of this anime. The show does a great job of matching music to the mood of each scene, ranging from serious to humorous. The opening and ending themes are well-chosen, complementing the show's themes of survival and resilience amidst chaos.\n\r\nHowever, the series does have its shortcomings, particularly in terms of character development and story progression. As the series advances, some viewers might find the characters becoming somewhat one-dimensional and the plot losing its initial allure. This inconsistency can be a bit off-putting, especially for those who were captivated by the strong start of the series.\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Zom 100\" presents an unconventional take on the zombie apocalypse, mixing elements of satire, horror, and comedy in a way that's both refreshing and, at times, a bit uneven. While it might not appeal to everyone, especially those looking for a more traditional zombie narrative, it offers an interesting perspective on how an apocalyptic scenario can be a catalyst for personal freedom and self-discovery. For those willing to embrace its unique blend of genres, \"Zom 100\" is a series worth watching.\n\r\nOverall: 7/10.\n"

I mean, who wouldn't want more of the hot mess that was the main series, right? But let me tell you, this short was a real game-changer.\n\r\nFirst of all, the animation was top-notch. I mean, it's not like the main series had any animation worth praising, but this short truly raised the bar. The fight scenes were intense, the character designswere fresh, and even the backgrounds were well done. It was like watching a completely different show.\n\r\nBut what really sets this short apart is the dynamic between Carol and Scrooge. These two characters had more chemistry in the short's runtime than the entire main cast did in the entire series. Their interactions were compelling and even had me feeling something (which is more than I can say for the main series).\n\r\nBut let's be real here, even with all of its improvements, it's still part of the Guilty Crown franchise. And let's face it, that franchise is beyond saving. But hey, at least we got this short as a silver lining. I mean, it's not like we'll ever get a reboot of the show with Carol and Scrooge as the main characters, but a man can dream, right?\n"

They often tread the fine line between building upon the established lore and characters and risking overexposure. However, \"Mushoku Tensei II: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu\" manages to not only walk that line but also dance gracefully upon it.\n\r\nThe story picks up with our protagonist, Rudeus Greyrat, in the aftermath of a heart-wrenching development in his relationship with Eris Boreas Greyrat. Heartbreak sends him on a journey to the Northern Territories, where he searches for his mother. On the surface, the premise might sound mundane\u2014a hero in a seemingly aimless quest. But this is where\"Mushoku Tensei II\" excels; it takes the ordinary and infuses it with extraordinary depth.\n\r\nWhat sets this sequel apart is its ability to make the seemingly slow and mundane aspects of life engaging. Rudeus' robotic routine and endless rumination mirror the struggles of real life, creating a relatable and sympathetic character. It's as if we're watching someone trying to navigate through the most mundane aspects of existence, and surprisingly, it's fascinating.\n\r\nThe introduction of the party Counter Arrow injects life and energy into Rudeus' journey. His adventures take on new meaning as he rediscovers the joys of daily life and the camaraderie of fellow adventurers. It's a testament to the storytelling that a simple change in perspective can breathe fresh life into the narrative.\n\r\nIn a genre often criticized for its formulaic approach, \"Mushoku Tensei II\" stands out as a shining example of how to do an Isekai sequel right. It's slow-paced, but intentionally so, mirroring the ebbs and flows of life itself. It's a show that teaches us that even in the most ordinary of moments, there can be extraordinary beauty.\n\r\nAs for the claim that it's miles better than other Isekai, well, it's hard to argue otherwise. \"Mushoku Tensei II\" dares to be different, and in doing so, it transcends the trappings of its genre. It's a sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but also sets a high bar for what Isekai anime can achieve.\n\r\nOverall: 8.98/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Chuukou Ikkan!! Kimetsu Gakuen Monogatari: Kimetsu no Utage Tokubetsu-hen\" is an anime that had some special episodes created for the live event \"Kimetsu no Utage\" back in 2019. Although the art style is nothing extraordinary, it does the job. Now, when it comes to the dub, I'm usually a sub purist, but let me tell you, the only content I'd watch the dub for is this one. It's perfect to just have in the background as you do something productive, no need to actually pay attention to the content. So, if you're looking for something to play on the side while doing chores or working,give this a try, you won't regret it!\n"

            "content": "\n                The Canon Delights:\r\nWhen Boruto delves into its canon material, it truly shines. The series takes us on a journey alongside Naruto's son, Boruto, as he navigates his way through the ninja world. The development of the next generation of shinobi is intriguing, and we get to witness the growth of familiar characters and their dynamic relationships. The action sequences are intense, the emotional moments tug at our heartstrings, and the overarching plot gradually unfolds, keeping us engaged and invested.\n\r\nThe Filler Frustration:\r\nHowever, it's impossible to ignore the elephant in the room\u2014the abundance of filler episodes that outnumber the canon content. These fillers often disrupt the pacingand dilute the overall experience. As fans eagerly anticipate the progression of the main story, they are met with seemingly endless arcs that contribute little to the overarching narrative. This excessive filler can be frustrating and lead to a sense of disappointment, leaving viewers longing for more meaningful content.\n\r\nAn Overhated Gem:\r\nDespite its flaws, Boruto has been subject to excessive criticism and hate. The comparisons to its predecessor, Naruto, are inevitable, and while it may not match the same level of intensity and depth, it offers a fresh perspective on the ninja world. It introduces new characters, explores different themes, and tackles issues that resonate with a younger audience. Boruto deserves a chance to establish its own identity rather than constantly being measured against Naruto's legacy.\n\r\nEmbracing the Potential:\r\nThe key lies in striking a balance between the canon story and the filler content. Boruto has demonstrated its potential in delivering captivating narrative arcs and character development, but it needs to find a way to prioritize these aspects over the abundance of fillers. By focusing more on the main story and utilizing fillers sparingly or creatively, Boruto could truly flourish and captivate fans both old and new.\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIn the vast world of Boruto, there is a mix of greatness and frustration. While the abundance of filler episodes may dampen the overall experience, the canon material offers compelling storytelling and character growth. Rather than dismissing Boruto entirely, it deserves a chance to prove itself as a worthy addition to the Naruto universe. By embracing its potential and striking a balance, Boruto has the opportunity to become a captivating series that stands on its own. So let's give it a fair shot and see what adventures await in the shinobi world of Boruto.\n\r\nOverall: 7.26/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Watching Psycho-pass for the first time was such an experience, but that was ages ago. I have coupled through the second season, it turned out decent, not as bad as people say, of course, when you're missing one of the best antagonists \u201cMakashima\u201d, then it's excusable.\r\nThe brutal detective thriller has started to fade out of my memories, with only the biggest moments still brought up by me to this day on my Anime discussions, but watching through this movie was like cycling through my collective memory folders that relate to this Anime, remember every detail fro the series as I sit through the whole thing.\n\r\nStory(7/10):\r\nSomething I found very un-Pasycho-Pass-y is the simplistic outline of the plot. I couldn't help but notice how straight forward the whole thing is, with the movie starting up by setting a mental facility. Introducing characters whom expressions scream if \u201cI'm the bad guy\u201d. It felt like a solved case as soon as it began, which made it more of an action-oriented case than one that demands critical thinking and mystery thriller that the parent show excelled at.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI'm always a complainer whenever I see CGI heavily used on an Anime, however, Psycho-Pass has always been one of the exceptions. The 2D and 3D elements communicate flawlessly, sometimes, even hiding the fact that what's going on the screen is fully CG.\r\nCharacter design is one of the strongest visual strength that I love about this series. It does the realistic anatomy so well, that you might mistake it as a rotoscoped live action. I like the backgrounds as well as how well they manage to blend all the animated elements into a fully digestible visual package.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nHearing the first opening of the first season was all I needed to approve this aspect of the movie. It is just so good, it stands the test of time and it brought back the same chills it did back when I was first watching the series episode by episode.\r\nThe voice acting is appreciable, no overly-cute moe moans, just a trembling audion that shows how horrifying the played scenario is.\r\nThe OSTs are spanking, straight up.\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\r\nWhat I think is a reason enough for anyone to watch this movie lies in the characters. No, I don't mean the general cast, but speaking specifically about Miku.\r\nIt's a popular opinion in the fandom how hated Miku is. I sided with the same mentality here, but not for so long.\r\nIt seems like a character arc for her, this entire movie is just her taking on a case, showing us the third party, how it's done, she no longer whines, she no longer hesitates. She is the inspector everyone wanted her to become.\r\nA word for the antagonists, not anything that leaves a lasting impression, pretty forgettable if you asked me as I'd take any minor village from the TV show over these two.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nWhat a comeback. Just about to time delve into the three movies and the third season, and oh boy, I say it again. What a start.\r\nJust the kind of movies that puts you on the run, a quick recap of what the show is about, building up for what to come next.\r\nAlthough the case at hand was not anything of immersing like the show spoiled us, but the spirit and the adrenaline rush is there when the moment calls for it.\n\r\nOverall (7.8/10):\r\nFor a long-time-breaker, someone that hasn't seen the show in what counts by the ages, yes, definitely see it. It is not going to give you anything new per se. But it does bring back the topping and the appeal of the first two seasons. I would still put the first major movie \u201cPsycho-Pass: The movie\u201d above this any day though.\n"

The show has been in the dark for decades before a continuation was announced, yes, you heard it, this is a sequel to a two seasons series from the early 2000s, the dated animation might scare some people away, but please, give it a chance before proceeding to watch this season.\n\r\nThat aside, if you just wanna jump in to get a better grasp of the memes, then knock yourself out, this show is a minefield for memes, almost every line ofdialogue mocks common sense in all sorts of metrics until you realize you're watching Baki, a show that invites you to open your head, grab your brain out, seat it next to you and shares a bowl of popcorn over a streamline of episodes, it is that simple and unassuming.\n\r\nFrom a personal telescope, it appears that Baki, as a character, loses a lot of character that you see him develop in the earlier two seasons, he's a walking empty sell, hungry for fights and lacking principle, slowly falling under the emo trend that carries no special depth, which is a shame considering the character development he received up until this point, it's almost as a soft reboot for his character.\n\r\nWhat's better than Baki though, is the return of all of the loved familiar faces, characters we thought were one-offs make a comeback and fill you with joy and excitement every time they are on screen, making you sheer for them and care about them more so than you'd do about the main character. In addition to that, some of the newly introduced characters make for some of the best ones in the entire series, it's shocking how a show that doesn't take itself seriously like Baki is able to flip the switch in an instance and present a rooster full of strongly willed, interestingly conflicted characters that waver between good and evil, making it easy for the viewers to sympathize and like them.\n\r\nProbably the most visible enhancement from this sequel is undoubtedly the animation, although the arc looked a tad weird coming from the older seasons, they still pay a huge deal of loyalty to the original art of the Manga. Although I'm still raising an eyebrow over some questionable CGI placements, that brought about nightmarish memories of that opening from the older seasons.\n\r\nIt's very known that Baki is not the type of show that might have you reflecting upon life, praise for masterful writing, or make examples out of, and even if it was, no judging you, but one can't deny how entertaining this airhead of a show can really be most of the times. Which all of its drawbacks, it hosts some of the most hype fights in anime, and this is no overstatement.\n\r\nOverall: 7.9\n"

There was no hope left for this franchise from anoutside perspective, but then, something came up, declaring the return of SAO with promising hights, sough by many like the second coming of Jesus (AS), the movie adaptation of the Ordinal Scale arc.\n\r\n- Story (7.6/10):\r\nWith the release of the NerveGear, and the follow-up Amusphere, full-dive accessibility was as widely spread as smartphones are, these things were everywhere, every time, until a new technology slipped though, stealing all the spotlights, the Augma, move all the fuss and buzz from Virtual Reality to Augmented Reality, it seems, as these gadgets get smaller, the world and applications get much bigger. The inclusion of such a device was suddenly dropped it felt like it comes out from nothing, a typical decision to make after your boss pats your back violently, am I right Kawahara? (for the curious, Mr. Reki Kawahara is SAO's writer).\n\r\nThe move from VR to AR was very present and hard felt in the movie, looking at how Kirito and folks rely on system assists in the virtual world, physical genuinely was out of the question, but here, you can see the struggle. Kirito is by no mean the fit sports dude, so seeing him struggle was a nice touch.\n\r\nThe themes of the plot connected a lot with the Aincrad arc, it brought back the fun, the sad, and the sought past of what happened during the 2 years ordeal that was SAO, it also picked up a lot of talks and provoked many philosophical questions, what really makes a person, is it the memories you have with them? Is it their consciousness? Is it the impact they had on the world? Deep stuff that makes you think.\n\r\n- Art (8.2/10):\r\nWell, I guess, it's a movie, and a recent one at that, so we're home, or at least, your eyes are. Beautiful choreography like nothing we've seen before in SAO, the magic of a higher budget was definitely felt strongly.\r\nCGI was used heavily, but for the sake of the settings, that would be batted off. The characters felt the same more or less, but I still couldn't shake the difference in Kirito and Asuna, both appear to look a bit more mature, probably due to the slight changes of the art style, or perhaps, it's the weird nose shine thingy.\n\r\n- Sound (7.7/10):\r\nI would stand on the average side when it's the audio department, I felt like the simple fact of bringing on some of the old openings would have upped this one a notch, but no. The featured songs, seeing how all of one of the key characters does is sing were good for their moment, and that's it.\r\nThe voice acting brought nothing new to the table, just some generic yelling and screams all over the place, enough to keep conversations going.\n\r\n- Character (7.6/10):\r\nTo be honest, it's the old \u201ceasy come easy go\u201d fiasco all over again. A better way to put it, it's was almost a carbon copy of the Mother's Rosario arc, having an arc revolve around a certain one-off character to motivate the cast to act and react. If anything, Asuna and Kirito's moments were the highlights here, seeing how there was a big theme around memories and what makes one him or herself.\r\nEiji as an antagonist was a bit weak and uninteresting, although, he did provide Kirito a hard opponent to stand against, the same goes for the man behind Augma felt like a bootleg helpless knockoff of Akihiko Kayaba, he started off the controversy, but did little as nothing to spice it out.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.3/10):\r\nThe enclosed story, the tides to Aincrad were strong and what made the most of this movie, and the action sequences were definitely a highlight.\r\nMore fan service from the movie, both in a cultured way with a certain bath scene and in the battle sequences. Even for me, I've just seen SAO for the first time in under 10 days ago, yet, the movie was hitting on the right wave for me to make me feel nostalgic as though years have passed or something.\n\r\n- Overall (7.88/10):\r\nSome people would call this a comeback, just the right comeback for the franchise if you will. I would easily recommend this to anyone wishful enough for the return of SAO, just like it says at the last second of the movie while flashing on the screen; \u201cSAO will return\u201d.\r\nDefinitely the tribute the franchise deserves, pack it up, get something to eat, get comfy, it's going to be a lengthy movie, and oh, heads up, there is a nude scene in there, so be cautious while diving in.\n"

A weird title that translates to \u201cO Maidens in Your Savage Season\u201d, a title that exposes way too much about its show, weirding out the savageness it has from the get-go, throwing it at you savagely becauseyou won't say no. That last part made no sense, but so did the show at hand, let me elaborate.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nIt's unfortunate how fast this hidden gem has turned from 0 to a 100 in a negative way, while it holds a semi-original plot that you don't see every season. A dramatic slice of life with some rom-com aspects to it that revolves around confused highschool students, you know that's always an entertaining play. Most similar shows would put you on a 3rth party perspective following a male protagonist, or several of them struggling with this savage and scary phase called teenage years. However, unlike most of those show that follows this common trope, the main cast is composed of female characters, excessively obsessed with sex, or what they like to call it, \u201cess-e-ckess\u201d, or something similar to that, deforming that word of coursed accomplished nothing, but create more drama, and that's how the show sparkles, creating uncomfortably embarrassing moments between already easily embarrassed individuals with only makes for great gags. That, in a nutshell, is what you get from the first episode onwards, but oh boy, if only they followed on the same train, things would have been a little better than they ended up being.\r\nAlmost mid-way, the show makes a complete turn into a dark and unexpected corridor, betrayal, treason, and most of all, PEDOPHILIA. and I gotta say, the show was at least brave enough to put and discuss this sensitive topic on a mainstream medium, it was of course very wrong to look up some times, but it served a purpose to enrich the relationships between the characters, that is, if the story took itself way more seriously, instead, I ended up looking at another mess that brought me a handful of unwanted \u201cKuzu no Honkai\u201d vibes. I did not enjoy that as much as I would want to say out loud.\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nOn a visual note, this show about savage maidens was the sweet spot for me this season, you've got all sorts of rivaling shows airting at the same time, each proclaiming a unique art style to them, leaving the more neutral go to this show.\r\nTo sum it up, it's like putting a flashy Instagram filter on top of your generic-looking slice of life. The colors have a special dim to them, very faint and barely monochromic, but still retain so much color into them.\r\nThe character designs were, well, generic, but it makes no problem whatsoever, as the visuals are only there to present the story, and they do their job flawlessly.\r\nThe backgrounds are, mild! boring to look at, mere containers for the characters to take their highlights on. Definitely, not the strongest point of the Anime.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nWHACK, Nah, I just felt like saying that, out of context, for the folks that like to skip through review paragraphs? here, have some \ud83c\udf68.\r\nI think this is what made for the most enjoyment I got from the show. It is very hard to put in so much, feelings, so much confusion and so much desperation into a lost teenager that always though the world is centered around them, and are just realizing otherwise, you could actually almost physically feel it. It is undeniable one of the best vocally produced Anime shows of the season, so much talent.\r\nThe opening and ending songs were so good, hearing them playing at the last moments of the last episode put you into a dearing mind, I'm totally going to miss this show.\n\r\nCharacters (6.5/10):\r\nThe wide group of protagonists and the short serialization of the show were probably one of its biggest weaknesses. You never have enough time to properly flesh out every character, and so as a result, you find the show alternating between multiple characters almost in a chaotic way. Too many relationships at stake, way too many variables, a character would claim something, only to revoke it an episode later, you'd think a character is developing a certain way but end up on an entirely different side of annoying. I've seen confused teenagers, but these folks were just poorly directed. And again, I blame it on the short length of the show, because they do have a lot to flesh out, they just don't get enough screen time to do so.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.3/10):\r\nJust like any other show, trash it was or a masterpiece, they always have some way to still being entertaining. The show is very dramatically exaggerated, full of clich\u00e9 tropes, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable, it's a genius sit full of laughs, drama, and sometimes, disappointments. The characters act like teenagers, the horrify you just like one, and in some instances, their stupid decision can even reflect on your past mistakes. Just like its name, it does reflect on that SAVAGE time period. In a save way nonetheless.\n\r\nOverall (7.36/10):\r\nI got into the show expecting a comedy heavy highschool centered slice of life, turned out I was slapped on my face by excessive drama as if the show was trying to deliberately get rid of the funny side of it and force out \u201cplot twists\u201d at the end of every episode. It helps to know what you're getting into first, it definitely not a tear-jerker, but the controversies it pushes are quite ... sudden. Just so it doesn't jump-scare you into quitting, there is some aspect of pedophilia criticized here with only scratches on the question, should controversy be encouraged or censored? Well, the show knew what it was getting into, so despite that, there were some restraints that kept it from crossing the line.\n"

            "content": "\n                They say time is the true ruler, so simple yet very complex and unforgiving. Able to cause paradoxes and even get cat humor? At least, that's what I used to think Schrodinger cat was all about. As of yet, everything about time manipulation and travel is out of our reach and advancement that the majority of out depiction comes from fiction, many works in different shapes and forms had their unique takes on the topic, but very few managed to maintain a strict and stay as faithful and concise as it started by the time they were concluded, and rolling an anime tongue about this,Steins;Gate always slips from the mouth, and for a good reason.\r\nThe literal alternative to the 2011 series hit, Steins;Gate that retains to this day a pretty high place on every top x best anime shows for what it had of spicey cliffhangers, jaw-dropping revelations, unpredictable plot twists, and original intercourse, a series that already had the ultimate conclusion, to begin with, and nothing in its case begged for a sequel (technically, that's not what this is). In the world of programming, there is a saying that goes; \u201cIf it works, don't touch it\u201d, but as many world-line, as there may be, a story can have all sort of roller-coaster twists and turns that it might eventually render a previous installement entirely on its feet. Enter; Steins;Gate 0.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nThe conclusion of Steins;Gate is ancient news by now, back in the first season we learned that they finally achieve world like Steins;Gate, a world line where neither Kurisu nor Mayuri dies, a world line that world war III is avoided, the world line of true peace that Okabe was desperate to reach, and for that, many people might be wondering what Steins;Gate 0 is for?\r\nExactly at episode 23 of the original series, there was an alternative version called \u201cSteins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero\u201d, also known as \u201cSteins Gate: Episode 23 (\u03b2), Open the Missing Link\u201d where Mayuri agrees with Okabe not wanting to go back in time and save Kurisu after the devastating truth of him being the one who kills her. Steins;Gate 0 is the direct sequel to that episode that follows what it was like to live for Okabe in a world he chose where Mayuri gets to live but Kurisu dies, this is the Okabe that sent the message from the future to Steins;Gate episode 23 Okabe so that he doesn't give up on saving Kurisu and thus avoiding the entirety of world line Beta. All of that mess sounds complicated on first words, but trust me the twists that shifted the story of Steins;Gate 0 were that of a greater scale.\r\nFor the most part, the classic cliffhanger episodes remained just as prominent, however, most of the episodes were just boring and filled with unnecessary dialogue that it makes you waiting for the punch line at the end of the episode because you know it's the running theme here, and for most people, the only thing that keeps this desperate follow up to the first season going.\r\nJust like the first season, Steins;Gate 0 borrows the concept of D-mails and memory transferring to delivery time travel action, but also relies more on physical time traveling and even expanded on new exciting concepts like AI and memory preserving, SEREN is no longer the only predator but few other adversaries seemed to have joined the lobby.\r\nIs a sense, Steins;Gate 0 feels more mature than its predecessor, Okabe, and folks are surrounded from every corner this time around, and Okabe, let's just say, he learned how to restrain himself in a sad way.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nThe handling of animation and art style was never a problem in Steins;Gate, and let's be real here, we're talking about White Fox (Akame ga Kill is not what'd you'd call a fantastic show, but it had some stunning animation).\r\nAll you need in this show is a consistent animation that retains its quality throughout, we're not talking about flashy battle scenes or fluid bullet dodging moments, this is a series heavy on dialogue and philosophy, all you need is a mature enough art style to portray the characters and settings so that the viewer might take things seriously.\r\nAll the characters are exact replicas of their old selves, after all, there was no major time skip or anything, which is always welcoming to the fans to see familiar loved faces, however, I feel like one thing that has become apparently a must in modern shows, it seems that every female in the cast has had an increase in her cup size. I get it, it's become a marketing tactic to add some degree of sexuality to certain characters in today's anime, but some diehard fans can never stand that, seeing old innocent Mayuri walking around with a heavy chest is never a pleasant experience you know.\r\nOne other note to make is on the gloomy and cold color palette used, it's obvious that this season is darker than the previous one, a running theme with it is depression out of all things, I mean, our beloved mad scientist is living his days in a black outfit, go figure it's going to feel like a nightmare in a GTA IV liberty city, you know that game had its problems in the cold blue filter on.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nI would go for days praising the voice acting quality in this franchise as a whole. I mean Okabe, his desperate calling voice is very believable and on performance standards, I get shivers every time he's spitting some emotional black magic, you can feel the hardness in his throat, that weak tone of voice to get from a sick falling person. That isn't exclusive to Okabe, all other characters have their area of expertise as well, you have Daru excelling at mimicking stereotypical otaku nonsense, and there is Mayuri with her delicate innocent voice, the \u201cTu-tu-roo\u201d can never be so powerful in the mouth of somebody else.\r\nThe opening theme songs were fascinating, \u201cFatima\u201d, nothing new for Steins;Gate and the amazing passionate \u201cEri Sasaki\u201d here, I mean, seriously, the first season's opening was spectacular, and this one continues on the perfection even further. The series covered a single opening theme song but one of two verses spanning equally on both parts of the series, the ending theme songs were also amazing, they sort of have that unique vibe in them that makes you beg for more, I talked about how common cliffhangers are here, these endings on teasing you more to create a time machine of your own and travel to a time in the future where you can watch the whole thing on a marathon.\r\nAnd let's also not forget the soundtracks. sung by the same singer that did the opening theme songs from the first and this season, and they don't fall short on delivering the same emotionally heavy and exciting experience, I would almost argue that Steins;Gate wouldn't feel the same without these tracks playing from the shadows, they have a strong presence that it's hard to not notice them from the moment they start kicking in.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nSteins;Gate's character cast was always so lively, filled with unique characters, you get the innocent, the nerd, the Otaku, the feminine... and the mad scientist. However, it seems Steins;Gate 0 has denied the existence of the last one, and simply replaced the \u201cM\u201d with \u201cS\u201d, and thus, the sad scientist known as Okabe was born.\r\nOkabe is thrown into severe depression, at last, he had managed to save Mayuri, but still at a dear cost of losing Kurisu. Okabe doesn't have the same charming feel to him after that, we've come too fond of the original clumsy self-proclaimed mad scientist that spreads joy unintentionally with his majestic laugh and made up conversations with his phone, nope, we got none of that here but a grieving miserable man in black clothing. However, all of that served for a final character development that was necessary to render the circle complete.\r\nIt seems that even us, the fans of the original (that didn't play the visual novel, a crime I know) are greeted by many unfamiliar faces that it almost makes us not feel at home, I mean, there is the old beloved characters, but also in the mix a lot of new ones, mainly consisting of Kurisu and Mayuri's friends, a lot of them were to some degree unnecessary, and served little to no value in favor of the story, whether they were planning on doing something with them but never got the time, that will remain a mystery, but as for the way it played out, they were just there, like that piece of paper on your desk you though you're going to make use of but end up forgetting about it and is just there until somebody disposes of it or the wind plays it off somewhere.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nTo some extent, I feel betrayed, mildly disappointed and annoyed from the fact that I have to admit to myself that there were indeed some boring parts I didn't like during my watch, I remember the first season to be this amazing experience, but not so much from this as a general look. Maybe that's because I binge-watched the old series, but as I got on the train hype very early on with this one, I had to suffer the weekly pain known as waiting because some shows are meant to be binged as over-doses of a pleasant unharming drug.\r\nThe first season will always be my favorite, Steins;Gate 0 will probably be one of my favorite conclusions of an anime ever, I'd ever dare place this next to the fantastic ending of Code Geass, it's just too perfect and makes a lot of sense, one of those endings that makes the show stuck to your head for days if not weeks. I totally loved the kind of cliffhangers we got, the sudden revelations and mindblowing realization were top notch.\r\nI've already made the decision of adding the opening and ending themes songs along with some of the soundtracks to my sacred collection for what amazing relaxing material they can serve the purpose for.\r\nWalking out of the whole experience of having watched this is truly a feeling like no other, I feel like finishing the trilogy of the Lord of The Rings all over again will so much lore and questions bumping into my internal skull.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nSteins;Gate 0 is almost its own experience, however, watching it with no knowledge over the last installment puts it out of context, I'd highly recommend checking this out if you already watched the first season and got to enjoy it. But first, not in mind that before that you have to watch the prequel \u201cSteins;Gate: Kyoukaimenjou no Missing Link - Divide By Zero\u201d to get into the mindset of diving in.\r\nOne thing to keep in mind, don't unleash all of your hopes on this one, not everybody is proud of what it turned out to be, I've also been told that this is not the complete remake of the visual novel, and even has its own unique ending, so a newer experience guaranteed, win, win I guess.\r\nIf it's been a while over 2 years or something after you last saw the original, I'd highly suggest you got and give it a rewatch because somethings won't add up to you that well, the most ideal option I can come up with is to rewatch the original, and then binge watch Steins;Gate 0 with no delays, because the wat is surely to leave its deep marks on your enjoyment, it's a huge factor here.\r\nIn an ideal world, we all love our share of Steins;Gate, right? in that case, have some popcorn ready, but be careful with your microwave okay?\r\nHave some friends join you because you will never somebody to share the intense moments with, a lot happens, the world is lively, and the decisions are more unforgiving.\n\r\n-El Psy Kongroo.\n"

I would differently say, it's not for everyone, the story isn't too obvious, and contains mature themes, violence, gore, and nudity, but isn'tour day and age full of these? no matter how much you deny it, this is a movie, that reflects what's happening every day in the world, probably not to you, but certainly, others are having it as their daily lives.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nIt's 2019, a pretty popular date for dystopia speculations if you asked me, that world hasn't even begun recovering from the third world war. technology has a strong presence, and corruption has never been so obvious. two teenagers, Kaneda and Shima are having fun on daily basis, dropping school and begin passionately about driving their bikes and pulling off stunts, playing it tough, until one day, Shima was taken into custody by the military for some mysterious research about psychic powers and the so-called \u201cnext human revolution\u201d, but with power, one becomes greedy and stubborn, the two friends are put to face off one another, would their bond tank it?\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nLet me filter the bad side of this, the art, in general, was okay, probably spectacular for its time, but it feels weird to watch anything of that caliber nowadays, I guess digital art spoiled us after all, the problem was with the characters' faces, some having one of those continent-wide foreheads, others with almost cellular mouths and spherical noses, but not until you get to pass the first 10 minutes, everything seems to be okay, you can get over that as there are things that make you up for it, but honestly, if you think about it, it's not that bad really, better than having exagerated eyes or overboard sharp chins.\r\nThis score would have been a lot lower if it weren't for the animation, however, how do I put it? fluid doesn't satisfy me to say, is there a term that actually seems more fluid than \u201cfluid\u201d? seriously, that was fantastic seeing how this was made back in 1988, and I would bet my money on it, this is better than most of the modern animation works, even the supposed still imagery is filled with motion and life, it really helps build you with the story.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nFor the most part, nothing was too off-charts, very casual soundtracks or anything, in fact, some of the sound effects were just so out of place, especially that owl-ish one, popping every now and then, but I gotta say, whoever worked on the tracks knew what they were doing, some scenes were just so -OMG-this-is-so-good, every the usage of random noises in the background made more sense from some parts. The voice acting was okay on the other hand, I'm just glad there wasn't any unnecessary screaming and shouting all over the movie.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nI didn't really like anyone besides the main character and that colonel, while everybody played their role, and actually affected the story, those two shined the most. Kaneda, the concerned naughty teenager that acts without too much barking, and the colonel that speaks up his mind, and keeps the action going, I could even say, they were both protagonists in their own way, both on their own side, but after the same goal.\r\nThe character designs were confusing, it's either me that isn't this adapted to this style of art, or something else, a lot of the character was drawn almost identically, some of them are even not recognizable as their respective gender, like Kei for example, which honestly made it more confusing and hard to follow the story, especially in fast-paced scenes.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nBefore watching this, I heard a lot of praise and compliment about this movie, and how people bragged about it as they masterpiece they thought it was, and to be honest, for each their taste, I for one, wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but by far, it's not the least boring or uninteresting, the movie was great, the feels and action were on point, nothing to keep me on my toes or anything, but it was heck of a great watch.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI was a bit disappointed by my ratings, though I would have to add another 10/10 movie to my list, meh, I still enjoyed this work, what's more, astonishing is how much it still holds a candle to many modern big budget movies even after 30 years.\n"

I loved every single reference, especially One Piece's, the humor was great, and the feels were as hard as someone using Bosushoku Haki ;),\n\r\n-Overall (8.6/10)\r\nI'll never regret watching this, I had it on my list for months now, and I've been avoiding it on purpose fearing that it might disappoint, but have I been deceived into jumping to conclusions, I absolutely adored this show, it had many influences, and definitely would recommend it to people.\n"

            "content": "\n                Wow, where do I even begin with Kengan Ashura Part 2? This show is an absolute powerhouse of adrenaline, drama, and muscle-flexing action. From the first episode, it's clear that the animation team really stepped up their game, with fluid and dynamic fight scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. The use of CG is also much improved, seamlessly blending with traditional 2D animation to create a truly immersive experience.\n\r\nBut the real strength of Kengan Ashura Part 2 is the characters. The backstories of the fighters are fleshed out in a unique 2D water paint style, giving a fresh and uniqueperspective to the show. It makes you feel invested in the fighters and their struggles, and the development of the characters is truly captivating.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget about the humor, the show does not shy away from it, it's full of muscle-head jokes, and it's hilarious. The way the show balances the humor and the action is truly masterful, and I found myself laughing one moment and on the edge of my seat the next.\n\r\nThe subtle development of these Ohma and Kozou is truly something special. It's not often that you see such well-crafted characters in an anime, and the way their stories intertwine is truly a testament to the writing of the series.\n\r\nOverall: 7.26/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                It has definitely become a religious offering for every season to have \u201cTHAT\u201d one Isekai that will have a good percentage of the fandom's following no matter how trash it is, in the food industry, that would be where McDonald's ranks up with, something very familiar that's easy to get into with a very simple to grasp concept that remains very true to the \u201cmodern\u201d reception of Anime. Unfortunately, \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d matches up with everything mentioned above, however, as unexpected as it is, the trashy part couldn't be more wrong.\r\nOn the surface, \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d seems like your type ofIsekai where your virgin pervert dude is thrown into a cursed land, along with his magical weapon and a shallow cast of females that form his harem save the world and live happily ever after. \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d has so little in common with your average Isekai and so much more with a world-renowned RPG game with a Skyrim-like depth in both worldbuilding and event handling making every episode more of a save checkpoint that bit by bit get you closer to the end game filling you with a great sense of achievement at the end of your journey.\n\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nTrust me, as generic and boring as it might strike you, it does get a whole lot better. Of course, every Isekai starts the same, the protagonist has to enter a new world after they either die or just give up on their world, sometimes it's just mandatory and doesn't give the said protagonist a chance to decide, but that's irrelevant to this.\r\nYou have this relatable middle-aged dude, somewhat of a capable gentleman of the working class that's just fed u with how he's living, suddenly surrenders his life to save an acquaintance of his, next second he's in another world that screams of RPG, but this time, it's neither an attractive shallow handsome-head that gets all of them hoes neither a powerhouse badass edgy rascal that gets his victory on demand. He just gets reincarnated... as a... S-Slime. I swear I wasn't going for the pun.\n\r\nThe plot runs through speedy pacing that really does justice to its short self-contained arcs. There is a lot of action and also a balanced amount of dialogue that serves a great deed into building the world around the characters making them feel like an ant, something very insignificant against a much greater entity, but that doesn't limit from their influence.\n\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nIf Anime could get sick, one of those devastating plagues would be the lack of inconsistency visually speaking. Some of the fights, not, let's say, all of the fights look outstanding, almost breathtaking with smooth cartography and slick camera movement.\r\nOn a general note, the show does have a noticeable almost warm visual effect layered on everything that makes everything look more greenish and natural that emphasized the medieval theme that houses the event of the story. The colors look bright and attractive while still easy to keep up with the action.\r\nThe anatomy is one other thing I feel they've done right, there is something about it that just screams of RPG, everybody looks like a heavily customizable NPC from a Bethesda game.\n\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nVoice acting wide, I can't really complain about anything while still can't find something to really praise that much, it felt decent, just above average at best, probably the ridiculous of high voices wasn't my cup of tea, but I really have to give it to the sound effects and the background soundtracks, oh, just so good, and you know how much cool abilities from magic to an ever more magical kind of magic, vocally simulating those can be a real challenge but the team behind this side of the show knew what they were doing, straight out of a quality AAA title.\r\nI can spit it the way I have it on my mind, but it's something very satisfying that highlights those short but yet powerful fire burst sound effects.\r\nThe soundtracks were really amazing as well, as you'd grown on them on your favorite RPG, the same was here, you could swear you've had countless hours of fun while watching and paying attention to them like you would do when playing a video game.\n\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nI can't stand for the show and say it had anything revolutionary regarding its character cast if anything, that was a HUGE roster to keep track of. And I'm not kidding, a tremendous amount of new faces make it to the screen every arc, and no, they stay there until the last episode, with is one plus point for not neglecting any characters. Take some notes, Naruto.\r\nIt feels really bad to not give off a slightly higher score on this pick, but I got to really take out my frustrations on some boring and badly written characters that are just there for the same of filling a character spot. Yes, talking about you, Milim, if that was how your correctly spelled and I'm not bothering to check, that's how much I care.\r\nA wide selection of characters are just there as an image of what it's supposed to be a powerhouse, but having a shallow childish figure hold a great title of power and following while being easily swayed by a gram of honey, Nah, that sounds like a wasted potential on a stupid loli from me.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nYou can imagine the satisfaction I got after every achievement done by the protagonist, as he's narrating what he's going through, you really feel like the person with the controller at hand doing everything yourself, starting off basically from scratch, literally, just a piece of moving slime with no primitive senses or anything to making it into a badass ruler that can start blad thunderbolts with a rise of a finer, just how badass is that?\n\n\r\nOverall (8.1/10):\r\nI really, really recommend this pick and even dare to recommend it to people that are not into Isekai because it truly does offer a unique experience that a lot of other similar shows fail to deliver upon. It's got likable characters, pacing fast enough to keep the action good and the excitement high all the time, and of course, it's got a lot of hype surrounding it.\n"

            "content": "\n                Have you ever dived into eating a delicious looking sandwich only to notice how spicy it is after like three bites in, confused as your face turns red from the intensity of spices, lost in confusion on what such an innocent looking sandwich could pack so much insense flavor in it? \r\nI might flip around the context of what I just said by switch the \u201csandwich\u201d with \u201cDomestic na Kanojo\u201d, the same analogy applies for how vague and explicit it suddenly came out of nowhere, and before we could complain, we were already way too swayed to address the problems. With its heavy incestuous plotpoints that know no border, it doesn't hold back on provoking that Taboo of a relationship which only a true descendant from Alamaba can relate to.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nIf there was anything this show excels at, it's the art of distraction. If we pulled all the chords, there is really no deep backstory that changes everything in the last moment or anything of that caliber, I would argue that Calliou had a more interesting plot line if we were honest, but \u201cDomestic na Kanojo\u201d is self-aware of that and unlike all other shitty adaptations, it acts against it by pushing it extra hard with the incest, that one taboo that's still not well expressed upon on mainstream media, and you know our inner selves enjoys these moral-provoking direction that pinches at a place we're not all too familiar with.\r\nI'm no expert in cooking nor do I have the slightest experience needed to pass as a taste analysis, but I can point out a spicy plot when I lay my eyes on one. Yes, we're talking about a dude that walks in on his sister A while masturbating to only go make out with sister B not even 5 minutes after.\r\nIt's the fast and unpredictable pacing that makes it work despite the many flaws it has, you can start off an episode all heartwarming and heavily wholesome with all sorts of sweet family friendly content, \u201cOh, brother, can you get me that glass of water - Sister A\u201d, \u201cof course - The brother\u201d and then they would go for hours bringing up fun memories from their childhood and oh boy does it transform very fast to a dedicated sex scene right after they get off the dining table.\r\nDespite the controversial references it packs, the show definitely knows how to steer it from a lighthearted sitcom to a dark love hexagon (If you will) that mocks a lot of serious social crises like taboo relationships, forbidden love, and suicide.\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\r\nArt style wise, it's really good, but animation wise, it's average at best.\r\nThe movements of the characters are very trippy and unmatching for such a fast-paced show like this one, but I guess their intention was to create something that's not very expensive whilst fulfilling the massive still shots of their shocked faces that just happen to occur at least 10 times an episode, you really can't criticize those Indian dramas without bashing on this show first for a reason.\r\nI really like the general art style of the show, notably more visible on character designs, the way they draw their faces and expressions, their anatomy at different camera angles, I adore that. Sometimes though, the proportions can be a little bit off and can really do a number of the overall visual quality.\r\nThere was a specific aspect of the art I really liked and would love to see in more other shows is that strange color displacement effect they dd on some of the scenes to enhance them visually and add special highlights on the characters.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe sound acting was... decent, I can't remember any moment that made me go \u201cdamn, that's performance gave me chills\u201d, it was just about enough to carry on the spiced up clich\u00e9 moments.\r\nOn the other hand, the opening song, without a doubt the best one this season, I could even argue that it has the potential to be the best opening of the year, but that's only going to be confirmed once 2019 is past us.\r\nMost fans compared it to Unravel, the popular song from the opening of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, some even called it Unravel 2.0 which I can sort of agree, it does give off almost the same vibes, the lyrics are just as strong and relatable to the story itself.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nAn interesting character rooster is what this show lacked the most. Talking about their treats and characteristics, I can name at least about enough other shows that had identical characters to fill out an A4 paper.\r\nNatsuo, in particular, was a horribly written character that makes you instantly not like it despite being the protagonist that you're supposed to cheer up, an unbelievable rational teenager that wants it all to be his way and decides to skip on all opportunities of character development he got.\r\nNow moving to the more controversial group of characters, the female acquaintances, it got so serious that it split up the fandom into four groups, for each their idolized waifu. On that note, I can definitely see why they were that popular as characters and I won't hide the fact that even I rode along their hype, speaking as one of the Miu team.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.7/10):\r\n\u201cDomestic na Kanojo\u201d was something I only decided to watch so that I can keep my watching list of the season dividable by two, and I so happened to stumble across this marvelous guilty pleasure series (Which I kind of found it like that) that fed me up from its spiciness and kept me asking for more every week, even though it falls short on quality when it's compared to its higher pairs of the season, it differently provided me with more enjoyment than most of them.\n\r\nOverall (7.6/10):\r\nIt's hard to say if it's a recommendation-worthy show without stretching it any further, it differently has its charm, that I can give you, however, a lot f people expect every show to have a deeper meaning behind it and end up missing on a lot of good series that aren't precisely that concerned on carrying out a reality series but do make up for the enjoyment you get from it.\r\nI at least know what other show is worthy of a rewatch along others, a lot of fans of the source material trash the show as much as they can, however, I do appreciate what it offered even if it was mocked to hell.\n"

The animation is nothing to write home about and the commercial is far too long for something that is essentially just an advertisement. I've seen far more impressive and creative anime-themed commercials out there. On theplus side, it's nice to see Rimuru playing nice for a noodles commercial. I suppose it's a nice little treat for fans of the franchise, but as a standalone commercial, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n"

I went semi-full angry-mode ranting on the parent show before for how much issues it had. However, Deadman Wonderland: Akai Knife Tsukai managed to fix a fraction of those.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nWhen reviewing the main show I mentioned how the character cast was poor and with no huge variety except for this character calledSenji, well, Deadman Wonderland: Akai Knife Tsukai is an OVA centered on the fan-favorite ssslice master Crow.\r\n2 Years after the mysterious explosion that took the world by storm, Senji a brutal policeman working hard to sanitize his town from mobsters while retaining a title for himself as the knives guy. We got to see a lot of background of Senji that explains more of his current mixed up personality of being vicious at times, and sort of soft at others.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nThis OVA doesn't fall short on what treat we got with the main story as it also does its liquid animations very well. But I really feel like the minimal amount of cool fights we got to see didn't give much opportunity for the animators to shine. Other than Senji and the main antagonist, all other characters however major or minor their roles were looked very poor and indistinguishable in design, cursed with the filler/side background-characters kind of face that makes it harder to remember.\n\r\n- Sound (7.3/10):\r\nI'm super glad they kept the original opening and ending theme songs from the main show, they bring a lot of nostalgia and feels having heard them all over again. I liked the voice acting way more on this one to be honest, probably because Ganta was absent, and I didn't have to deal with his cringy tone of voice. And you know, Senji is a cool guy with a fitting voice on all situations, screaming, blushing...etc.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nI'm giving this OVA the edge over the main show just because it's centered about an actual good character, a character that doesn't wine and doesn't act stupidly. They handled the transition between Senji's angry and good treats very well that it made up for an amazing minor character development.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nThis was surprisingly more entertaining than the main series, having Senji as the protagonist had a different feel on the franchise, a whole mature look on the world of Deadman Wonderland other than a middle schooler's, it made it way easier to grasp the politics of the world and how the upper class acts and stands for the Deadmen.\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\r\nAs great as this one-shot OVA is, it could never stand on its own feet if it weren't for the main show that first introduces a lot of concepts that are necessary to keep up with Senji's backstory. But that aside, this one is one of those rare OVA that are generally better than their parent stories in executing and progression.\n"

I binged through the first 6 episodes and ended up taking a break due to real-life reseason, and when I decided to come back, well, a full, fleshed out recap was in the wait for me. Fantastic.\n\r\nThe show already manages to cover a lot in just six episodes that thinking of a recapmight not be the best move to fully enjoy the show, but this one proves you wrong in the first 5 minutes, it highlights the important moments, quickly recaps through the massive information dump, with nicely placed speech bubbles, paragraph-long intel spread across the scene to make up for the fast-paced run though. I don't think it is a masu see, looking at the fact that you might be binging through the series in one sit, however, for a force of circumstance, it's like a loyal buddy that's always there for you.\n"

            "content": "\n                Every once in a while, especially relatively lately, an unordinarily-unfamiliar show debuted that breaks out of the mainstream take on what defines the inns and outs of said show. On several instances, they end up doing very poorly with a massive neglection and a low following compared to the rest of the airing shows. Fortunately, Miru Tights not only broke the mainstream formula but always defied the odds and pushed the tides that hold similar shows from blowing up and has had quite a huge following from a big portion of the fandom for how odd and appealing to the masses it was. That mightturn back to the fact that what it tackles is still a very under-spoken on topic for what it set up to present. The traditional take on fan service has become way too saturated across several shows that a lot of fetishes rarely if ever discussed. \u201cHold my tights\u201d was this show's answer to that, an erotic 4 minutes long fan service packed haven that keeps on giving until it hit the climax that was known as the legendary episode 7, a new high of \u201cara ara\u201d was reached, and it might be a while until some other show steals the spot, if not a sequel of the same show does it itself.\n\r\n- Story (6.5/10):\r\nIt's clearly apparent that the premise of the show was never going to be about a groundbreaking story from the get-go, after all, a 4 minute long episode can only do so much with how much cramped it is with wild fan service that steals the spotlight from anything that has to do with the main plot, but it can't be helped but point out tiny glimpses to what looked like mini-story arcs involving several related characters where the cameraman is way more invested in tight shots that he does about keeping his job intact, which can be glorified as a great sacrifice for all of us. I've honestly seen shows that were supposed to be more story centered fall short on delivering a solid story progression as near as Miru Tights', and it only works in favor for Miry Tights to see how well it even nailed aspects it was never meant to touch upon.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nLet's be honest, the power of the visuals alone is enough to deliver an enjoyable experience of the glory of tights. Only by seeing the phenomenally consistent movie-quality episodes back to back, you'd excuse their short length, it was the pinnacle of quality over quantity for the year. Shading was the key, super tight cloth wrapping perfectly curvy legs with a bit of an overlay gradient that shows some skin does wonders.\r\nAll characters have a consistent design going for them, just like in real life, no crazy haircut heads bobbing back and forth and no unordinary over the top characters roaming with unworldly customs, just normal people living a normal relatable life, which makes it closer to what you'd see in real life.\r\nThe camera angles were crazy and satisfactory that I felt like I need to personally give a raise to the fictional cameraman myself.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nA good visually aesthetic show can only feel as complete as it is with the help of an at least decently paced vocals. Lots of heaving breathing and audible moans were spoken, the energy that filled the voice acting perfectly went along with what was on screen the whole time.\r\nToo bad we didn't have any opening to remember the show by afterward, but we at least had a decent ending song that plugs that kind of hunger.\n\r\n- Characters (6/10):\r\nI think the characters themselves needed a lot more work for them to stand out as different people. I found myself quite lost about who's who most of the time, I couldn't even remember any character names nor their relations with each other, but maybe that was due to how amazingly it executed what it was about \u201cfan service\u201d.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nBatting my eyes on everything bad I've said so far, personally, this makes a top tied fan service series that delivered on what it promised, episode 7 especially would remain as one of the best episodes of the genre for me. Now, I'm not a tights guy, I didn't see myself enjoying this series that much before I started it, but honestly, it was pretty fantastic to have these quality shorts of guilty pleasure to look forward to every week.\n\r\n- Overall (7.7/10):\r\nIt simple, if you're into fan service, then the show is for you, even if you're not about the \u201cfan service\u201d, the animation and the attention to details stood for a great eye service along, and it would be such a shame had you not given your eyes the treat they deserve.\n"

The series has always left dark hints here and there but the wholesome slimy boy made us easily overlook them and think of the portrayed world as a magical haven where many laughs and goofs are shared and the evil is only an exaggerated form of a coping mechanism for the opposing sides, however, the nail has been hit so perfectly in the midst of suspense that the series solidifies its dark reach and grasp of its own story, no afraid of shifting the mood and vibes it made us comfortable with for a season and a half.\n\r\nCharacterization was a big part of what made Tensura 2 great, Rimumru, for instance, received a massive upgrade/change to what we've been seeing him as, so great that it overshadows everything else. A character development that feels like someone snapping out after many attempts of calming down and thinking logically, a very realistic reaction for what led it to happen. But without leading into any spoilers, let's leave it at that.\n\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (8.2/10)\r\nSound (8/10)\r\nCharacters (8/10)\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\r\nOverall (8.24/10)\n"

            "content": "\n                It was all dead silence for what seemed like forever, and then, suddenly, in the last 2 years, a surge in the Psycho-Pass fan service has been rising, 3 movies, a full-on the season, and now a sequel movie, one came after the other, it seemed like the treat the fandom wanted for forever. A moment of silence for those brethren that were big on the franchise, but didn't live long enough to witness its return.\n\r\n- Story (8.6/10):\r\nThe third season was long, it was different, and very complex when it started, and very little was clear up by the time it ended, leaving us ona massive blood rushing cliffhanger, something making me question why this one was a standalone release, it can easily stand out as episodes 9, 10, and 11, and seeing how each episode is a massive 40 minutes screening, it can allude to a total of 22 normal episodes, taking after the first season.\n\r\nThese 3 episodes or 2 hours movie (depending on how you saw it) do clear up all of most of the confusion left from the third season, it focuses on the infiltration of the Nona tower, an intense fast-paced tactical epic that had everyone we knew on the tip of their toes running against the clock.\n\r\nThe plot really shows that there is more to the Sybil system than we thought we knew, it expanded the lore more and dropped gazes at possible plot points that can be exploited for more stories to come.\n\r\nThe movie ends up on a peaceful open-ended note, a satisfying conclusion to everything from season 2, and that's a lot seeing how many releases we got, it tied up a lot of loose ends for once and for all, but also set up to a possible continuation that we hopefully get shortly.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nFantastic, this series is one of the rare ones that get the treatment it deserves and more. Everything falls in at a normal perspective, aside from the minimal CGI that slips, everything is blent just perfectly.\r\nThe fight scenes are given the proper time and effort, some of them even look like they've been rotoscoped. Definitely a product of a massive budget and a talented team of animators.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nI was mesmerized, even more than the prequel third season.\r\nI would have been super fine if they reused the same opening song from the previous season, but man, I was both surprised and amazed at how good the new one is, I mean, I enjoyed all of the OPs that came from this project, but I never put anyone close to the first OP, but now, they are on equal footing if it weren't for the nostalgia that surrounds the first one. \u201cSynthetic Sympathy\u201d by \u201cwyxt.\u201d, google it, it's mesmerizing. Probably the only opening that comes close to the vibes of the first season.\n\r\nThe ending theme song had some great emotions as well, very calming, and also saddening.\n\r\nThe voice acting was superb as always, the Seiyuus clearly love and enjoy what they are doing, every character feels like a genuine living being if its role. Ginoza and Kougami, of course, are present, and so is their charming voice, Arata too had some great performances especially at his big moment in the end.\n\r\n- Character (8.2/10):\r\nPlot-wise, Kei and Arata, no, their whole unite was the star of the third season and this one, but deep inside, we all know the OG team from season 1 was and is always the protagonist, their presence was very hard felt during both entries. It's very well directed too seeing how they didn't halt or overtake the progress of the new team, we do see them involved yes, but Arata and Kei did also have their shining moments, they contributed to the plot and gained somewhat of a following from the fans.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nThe third season while good, always felt like it lacked something import, the secret ingredient that makes Psycho-Pass what it was, we all thought, and for the longest time it was Kougami and folks, but hey, we did have them, even for a brief time before, but now, this violent action-driven arc made it clear, it was always the lore and the focus on the Sybil system, pulling on the threads and seeing the conflict rise up. It really gave literally everyone presents an opportunity to do something, even Shinon had a great moment with her character arc after so long. Definitely a promising comeback for the series.\n\r\n- Overall (8.76/10):\r\nIf you have already made it through the third season, I don't see what's stopping you, this is a canon continuation and it clears up all the foggy mess that the previous season left unclear, if fact, I would encourage people to watch the third season just so they can experience this greatness.\n"

Sounds like every sequel ever, a lot of twists have been revealed, and secrets finally unraveled, but does it still hold up against the previous season? specifically, against the magnificent second season?!\n\r\n- Story (7.2/10):\r\nUnlike the first season, that was a pile of fanservice with minimal story progression that gave more focus to nudity and neglected the story, and the second season that had a great sense of plot and development and considerable amount of fanservice, High School DxD BorNwas just a mess that didn't know what to focus on.\r\nDon't get scared, the fanservice in here is still consistent, and highly present to the extent of ruining some great emotional or serious moments, but also, there was so much content compressed into a mere 12 episodes which made the story very fast paced and rushed that so many details were left out or unexplored enough to make any sense out of them. Throughout this season, the plot became very repetitive and highly predictable, while it expanded on other characters, it was just the same thing, character X with sad backstory gets threatened and kidnapped, let's go fellas for the rescue, over and over again.\n\r\n- Art (8.1/10):\r\nThis one was slightly better than the previous seasons, considering how successful they were to provide a better budget, and it was well invested looking back at this season. It looks like the explored universe has gone some amped up physics that only seem to work on the chest areas the most.\r\nThe transformation sequences were just beautiful, a sight worthy of seeing over and over again.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nI'm just fine with the soundtrack as it is, fabulous notes that fill you with immersive and excitement for what's going, talking specifically about the sadistic violin tone that plays on those warm moments of generous fanservice. the same applies to every other piece of music.\r\nThis season had only one opening theme song, which is a blast looking on how I was opposed to the idea of having more than one opening theme song, it was great and catchy, differently better than the past season's second opening. I'd rank it as the third going by this order;\r\nSeason 1 opening > Season 2 opening 1 > Season 3 opening > Season 2 opening 2.\r\nThe ending song was great too with a huge potential for replayability.\r\nThe voice acting I think was great, having to see Issei screaming and shouting in rampaging moments felt intense.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nI don't hate any character, but Asia still has some problems she needs to address.\r\nAl of your favorite characters make an appearance here plus new fine ones, just like the previous season that focused on Kiba and a bit on Akeno, this one was heavily around Koneko's mysterious past and Akeno's ordeal with making it up with her father, but nothing as intense as Kiba went through in my opinion, he is still to this day, the most developed character in the series in my eyes.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.6/10):\r\nI would say that I did enjoy this, but not as much as I was expecting, it was differently better than the first season, but very low on quality compared to the second season. there were those moments that make you hard on action burning with fire seeing those transformations and punches exchange, but some other time, I was just like, why? it doesn't make sense.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nIf you have already made it through the first two seasons, why not watch the third? in my opinion, it's not as good as the build-up at the end of the second season was leading to, but it did have a lot of stuff to show, like new characters, backstories, and more...\r\nDon't worry, they have got you covered with the fanservice.\n"

The general picture is, back in the quite childhood days of the protagonists, all of them happened to have been to the same exact place (for plot reasons of course), it was then where their rivalry began. We don't get to see any of their older selves, and that was much appreciated. The animation was good?! Was it always like that? Imean I always had a skeptical opinion on their creep-worthy mouths, and having them as kids not only made them exclude all of the FUPA topping and size shrinking, but also managed to erase some of their facial features, vital ones nonetheless, \u201cnoses\u201d, as if the mouth wasn't already weird enough. You know what you're getting when you give a musical anime a shot, and this one is no different I'm not huge on classical music scores, however, my ear can tell a good flow from a terrible one, and it hasn't itched of such once. For once, Arima wasn't the sole focus, however, he did retain his crucial role, [pianist1] and [pianist2] were in the spotlight showing where their motives to challenge Arima came from. You never know that kids are able to concentrate on complicated topics, but gave the middle finger to logic and had it that way. Having not seen the show in a long time, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Moments packed along so much that a crappy PHP array can hope to ever accumulate. It was a remarkably interesting take but wasn't nonetheless any less mediocre. In the end, It would be as enjoyable as you found the original anime.\n"

The film sets the stage for a larger story, introducing us to our main character Kei Nagai, who learns that he is one of these immortal beings. The film explores themes of identity, survival, and morality as Kei navigates his newfound powers and battles those who seek to exploit him.\n\r\nThe animation is top-notch, bringing the intense action scenes to life and immersing viewers in the world of Ajin. The voice acting is also superb, delivering powerful and emotional performances thathelp to drive the story forward.\n\r\nHowever, the film does suffer from a slow pacing in certain parts, which can make it difficult to fully engage with the story at times. Additionally, the film's ending is a bit abrupt, leaving audiences with more questions than answers and yearning for the next installment in the series.\n\r\nIf this is your portal to the Ajin series then it's better to watch the Anime TV show (2 seasons) as it has better timing which really affects the slow pacing, and also adds in some additional moments that fill in a few gaps in the story.\n"

I don't know why I thought it would be different, given that it's just another typical anime. But I was pleasantly surprised... not.\n\r\nI stumbled upon this show thanks to some hilarious YouTube clips, but boy did it fall short of my expectations. It's a shame, I was really hoping for something that would blow my mind. But hey, what can you do?\n\r\nI'll tell you one thing, trying to relate to these characters at my advanced age is a lost cause. I mean, high school was a lifetime agofor me. But for some reason, this show managed to hit a few nostalgic notes. I suppose that's something.\n\r\nWhat I did appreciate about this show was its willingness to make fun of the common anime tropes. It was refreshing to see a show that didn't take itself too seriously and was able to break the fourth wall. It was bittersweet at times, as it reminded me of how much I miss those carefree high school days. But, as a comedy show, it fell a bit short.\n\r\nAll in all, \"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou\" was a fun and enjoyable watch, but don't expect too much from it. Just sit back, relax, and remember the good old days. Or, you know, don't. Your call.\n\r\nOverall: 6.9/10.\n"

This anime adaptation of the final manga arc, starting from volume 61, has proven to be a true gift to fans, offering a blend of heart-pounding action and intricate storytelling.\n\r\nThe story picks up after a brutal surprise attack by the forces of Quincy King Yhwach, leaving the Soul Society in shambles. As the surviving Soul Reaper captains mourn their losses and train to battle without their Bankai, the stakes have never been higher. Yhwach's power looms menacingly, and thetension is palpable as our heroes face their greatest challenges yet.\n\r\nOne of the standout elements of this arc is the character development, particularly for Ichigo Kurosaki. His journey to attain new power takes him to the very limits of his physical, emotional, and mental endurance. It's a testament to the depth of storytelling in \"Bleach\" that, even in the midst of intense battles, there's room for profound personal growth.\n\r\nThe animation quality in \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen - Ketsubetsu-tan\" deserves special mention.

The OVA drew a lot of specifics from Alice in Wonderland but really added a lot and made it its own parody with the wide charactercast.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nIt was really good, mainly still images with a few containing basic animations, but the quality was just as consistent and felt of a higher class. The clothing especially was a greatly portrayed, although was a bit too sexually expressive, with a lot of subjective revealing clothes and over the top breast juggling, some people would appreciate that, but some others think it's just a distracting pointless jerk move.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nIt started at first with only Lelouch and Nanually exchanging conversations with having other characters remain silent until they all burst to talk.\r\nThe good performance can be easily picked up, the soundtracks of the original series were reused here, and we all know those are some of the greatest.\n\r\n- Enjoyment: (7.5/10):\r\nIt was better than I was ready for at least. Seeing a Code Geass parody on a classic is one of the things you'd never ask for but would still be glad to have experienced. I had some giggles, was really pleased to see the old characters, it really felt like it delivers on so much more.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nFor sure, one of the greatest OVAs out there, I avoided it so much until I set myself to watch it, and was slapped in the face for why I hadn't gotten into it any earlier.\n"

If this music video were a dish, it would be the perfect blend of your favorite comfort foods, served with a side of pure awesomeness. \"Hungry Days x Bump of Chicken: Kinen Satsuei\" is like a culinary experiment where they've mixed the perfect ingredients of creativity, animation, and music to whip up an experience that's leaving us all utterly floored.\n\r\nPicture this: a glorious concoction of reimagined animation from the Hungry Days commercials, stirred together with fresh, newly animated scenes. It's like getting a taste of nostalgia while savoring the thrillof something brand new. And speaking of taste, this music video is so deliciously good that it could very well be the best song you've ever heard. And hey, who's to say you're biased? If it makes your heart do the cha-cha and your feet tap-dance involuntarily, then that's music done right!\n\r\nNow, let's talk visuals. We're not just talking about your run-of-the-mill animations here. No siree! We're talking visuals that are so amazing, they'll make you yearn for a high school slice of life set in the One Piece universe. I mean, imagine a school where Shanks is the guy who risked it all for Luffy's sake, and Zoro is still on his path of relentless training, all thanks to his buddy Kuina. It's like the One Piece crew decided to ditch the Grand Line and hit the books instead!\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the cherry on top\u2014the comments that read like plot twists in a rollercoaster anime. Who knew that the One Piece world could be so hilariously different yet strangely the same in a high school context? From a Germa 66 sportswear company to a restaurant called Arlong Park and a sweet-making empire under Big Mom Family, this slice of life could rival the wildest fan theories.\n\r\nBut the brilliance doesn't stop there! Imagine a music club led by Brook, who's reminiscing about his days as a first-year when he formed a band. Their logo? None other than the iconic whale Laboon! It's like a symphony of interconnected details that make your brain dance a jig of delight.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the emotional rollercoaster ride that is this music video. With characters like Usopp leaving behind his childhood friends and Nami facing the struggles of work-study balance, it's as if they're like us, juggling life's challenges while keeping their pirate spirit alive. But the show-stealer has to be Luffy, the enigmatic mystery man who keeps us guessing. Is he the silent observer or the ultimate prankster? Only time will tell!\n\r\n\"Hungry Days x Bump of Chicken: Kinen Satsuei\" isn't just a music video; it's a symphony of creativity that resonates with our anime-loving souls. With visuals that tickle your retinas and a melody that dances in your ears, this piece of art deserves a standing ovation. So let's raise a virtual toast to this masterpiece, because it's proof that when you mix animation, music, and One Piece magic, the result is a dish that's simply unforgettable.

The world is full of bullshit, the government isn't the least interested in planting micro cameras on your pets to spy on you while doing your creepy weeby shit, but hey, this is Anime. A medium that always entrust the greatest powers to characters in their puberty, the world could never be safer am I right? While the adults are laying on their backs it's alwaysthe kids that save humanity, but hey, speaking of conspiracy theories again, the cartoon \"kids next door\" might as well be a message from those who are aware of the dark truth, I'm going off of topic here, enough spilling bullshit and let's actually talk about Charlotte.\r\nA series that not surprisingly enough relates to what I was just saying, an original work by studio P.A Works that gets a huge praise from the fans going as far as calling it a masterpiece, and hold on, that's a title very rarely to be obtained by modern works for how repetitive they can get. But does Charlotte fall into that same case? Here we're pealing off the fans' claims, dissecting this series and exposing it for what it is. Buckle up, get comfy, and let's hit the keyboard for some words.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nFirst and before anything, this is a story by Jun Maeda, the creator of the both critically acclaimed well established and praised series, Angel Beats and Clannad. Just so you know what you're in for, I for one didn't enjoy Angel Beats at all however digged Clannad so much that I consider the series to be a life changer for me, goes to show that one can only do so much, not all works of an author can be equal, and Charlotte is no exception here.\r\nIn a world very similar to our own, some people through their adolescent obtain superhuman powers, like pyrokinesis, telekinesis, teleportation and so on. Otosaka Yuu, the protagonist was living his life like a big fish in a small pot, thinking he was the chosen one and the lone in the world to have powers until he gets exposed to the truth of the world, kids all over the worlds are blessed with very useful abilities, and now he's charged with the help of the student council members that also have powers to try and capture the ones that use their abilities for mischief. A very generic story structure right there.\r\nIt does start very slice of life natured and slow, with a lot of focus on comedy until the feel train hits you like a damn \"Gamu Gamu no King Kong Gun\" when you least expect it, and let's be honest, Clannad and Angel Beats have made that very clear, I'm about to spill some spoilers for Angel Beats here so keep notice and skip the next few lines; there are even theories out there that the protagonist of Angel Beats is the protagonist in Charlotte after he was reincarnated for what they both hold in similarities.\r\nAs I was saying, the story was very uninteresting for me for the most part, the score could have been even lower here if it weren't for that humongous plot twist nearing the final episodes, my God, I don't think I've ever been so skeptical and at the same time opening my mouth as a garage door from confusion and astonishment since I last saw the plot twist at the end of Mirai Nikki, shit can get pretty intense at the end, but it still doesn't make up for the poor start, that's where most people drop the series. But it does fill you with satisfaction when you start noticing the hints that were all over the initial episodes that led up to the big bang at the end, for that, I give my props.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nBecause Charlotte is another sibling to Angel Beats, Clannad, (and to drag on the list; Little Busters, Kanon and more...) they adopted a very similar art style in design only in a more modern quality and detail. I'm not a big fan on the massive eyes that take most of the face on the author's older series, but this at least was acceptable, not dragged way too much it's noticeable.\r\nThe animation was beautiful, I can't complain about anything, but it was still nothing memorable, interesting enough to keep you visually interested in the story.\r\nI would say that their focus here was on the male cast, the female characters weren't too flashy looking aside from probably a trio that has a lot of screen time, but the males were straight up from a model factory, sorry if that sounded a bit too dark but seriously, everyone looks at least like they could have a harem series with them as the protagonist, going as far as taking the spotlights from the protagonist himself. I surprisingly did enjoy the CGI scenarios in here, I'm glad they didn't over do it, it was very short and that was the charm of it.\n\r\n- Sound (7.7/10):\r\nThe voice acting was okay, with some annoying voices here and there, so glad those ones didn't have too much screentime or my ears would have started bleeding. The only thing I enjoyed was the opening theme song, I wasn't a big fan of the ending theme song but the opening one really did it for me, I know I have extra ammo for my conversation now *wink*. The soundtrack, well, it was too unexciting for me to remember, even the music, the story was a bit heavily focused on music and yet it still didn't hit the spot, even the terrible (Just my opinion) Angel Beats' music were good, at least I can spit that truth out.\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\r\nAt the start of the series I was set to giving this aspect of the show a 3, probably a 4 if I felt generous. The characters were too shallow for me, nothing actually stood out from them aside from the flashy character designs, but I ain't letting any colors fool me.\r\nI went through the whole show and I can barely remember 2 names aside from the protagonist's who himself gave me a hard time to remember his name as well, until I made it to the 10th episode or something, yes, that's how uninteresting the cast was, probably the story could have been even better with better characters.\r\nBut hey, how did this rise up to 6/10 you ask? well, the protagonist went through a sigh to be seen of a development, I would show you clips from him at the beginning and him near the end and you wouldn't believe me if I told you they were the same person, the change was so massive and noticeable, but it didn't happen overnight which I appreciate. I don't think their names would survive for another day in my head though, the pacing has really dropped since Clannad.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI was questioning myself when I got midway through the series as nothing special had already happened, but before I realized it, a certain happening occurred, character development started flowing, and a lot of plot points were explained which made the wait worth it. I honestly went from not being interested at all, something very frustrating that this could have been worse than Angel Beats for me, but the twists at the end made me interested yet again in the neck of time, this is something that I would definitely rewatch one of those days.\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\r\nWell, before anything, please don't let my nagging about how bad I found Angel Beats or my praise on how good Clannad was for me deceive you or give you a clear image on both series if you haven't watched them already, remember those were only my experiences with them, who know, probably I just didn't watch Angel Beats in its respective mood or something, but this is an entirely different series with its own ups and downs. I can't guarantee that you will enjoy at least the first 6 episodes, I know I didn't, but if you could just hang out there at least till past the first six episodes you will have quite the payoff.\n"

A show like nothing we're used to especially lately, with gloomy colors, heavily traditional, and aggressively\r\ndark and controversial for its airing time.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nIn a world where demons have the superstitious upper hand, corruption is the common language, wars everywhere, famine\r\nevery day and genocide is a solution for everything. A samurai ruler sacrifices his newborn son for the demons in order\r\nfor his land to nourish, as his ruling mind convinced him that sacrificing a potential heir is a small price for his\r\npeople's salvation. Several demons reacted, each of them consumed something off of the poor little kid, and it just\r\nhappens that one of them fails at consuming whatever was left from a rusty skeleton and a mush of rotten flesh, no\r\neyes, no ears, no limbs and not even a healthy mind.\r\nGiven all the odds against him, he still survived under the care of a monk-looking doctor that has taken from providing\r\nprosthetic limbs for the dead and the sick a profession, a weird flex, but it only gets weirder from here on.\r\nHyakkimaru was the named given to the cursed poor kid, he had spent plenty of years under the care of the doctor until\r\nit was time for him to leave and walk his own path of restoring what was taken from him, defeating demon after demon,\r\nuntil that one day he met a mysterious kid. enter Dororo.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nIt was visually interesting, to say the least. It feels as if Dororo took the same old school art style every other show\r\nused back in the day, added in some seasoning by none other than the kitchen donkey himself and threw it on a plate for\r\nconsumption and that was probably the best thing to do for an old series such as it was, it definitely helped make it\r\neasier to watch through episode by episode.\r\nFor a seasonal series, it's disappointing how it lacked a definitive consistency through its serialization, some episode\r\nwere just the best out of all airing shows, whilst others did not scale up to the same standards, almost as if you were\r\nwatching a different show altogether.\r\nThe animation was, at the hight of it, breathtaking. For an action show, you bet you're getting a fight at least once an\r\nepisode, and for the major ones? Enter movie quality scenes, even for a couple of seconds. The hand to hand and\r\nswordfight feels natural and exciting, no such reusable snaps or slacking low-rate frames to drag down the rest of the\r\nproduction.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nLet me get this right off the way first, the opening and ending songs in this show are party bangers, every single one\r\nof them. And I'm confident enough to call the first opening as the best in the crown, really inspiring and with great\r\nvocal cords, something you definitely don't see in every Anime. The ending theme songs are probably the least spoken\r\nabout on every show, and you can't help but understand why seeing how most people see them as skippable extra topping\r\nthat is just there to fill up the 24 minutes mark but not with \u201cDororo\u201d.\r\nThe voice acting in this show is a little bit weird, I don't know if it's just me, but I can't help but feel a very old\r\nschool vibe from it, it's almost visible to the naked eye how for example, Dororo's voice feels like it was recorded two\r\ndecades ago, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, it just worked so well with everything else.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nFrom a newborn to a full-on adult. It feels like you've been raising a child on your own for decades, mostly because of how\r\nfrequently Hyakkimaru's personality changes as he wins something of his back, he may have never experienced hearing in\r\nhis life, but when he finally hears something, it just changes him, it flips his world, it influences his fighting\r\nstyle, it even alters his behavior and interaction to the world, and that was just an example of what a single sense does\r\nto him, and you can only imagine how different of a person he is at the end of the series from what he started off as in\r\nthe beginning.\r\nA lot of minor characters come and go, pulls off some plot-changing decisions and then disappear until they face the\r\nconsequences back.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nThis was definitely one of those shows that makes you feel empty after you finish it, you get too interested on a weekly\r\nbasis, and then suddenly it's the end. I'm not a big fan of how it ended, but I can think of a lot of other ways it\r\ncould have been bad, so I'll suttle with how it turned out for the sake of being faithful for what it set out for.\r\nI really enjoyed the fights, I enjoyed the characters, I loved the songs and the visuals, I wrote theories, I basically\r\nhad a phenomenal experience with the series, I felt connected, concerned, mild feelings of anger, happiness, and sadness, it was one\r\nheck of a rollercoaster.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nAs someone who hasn't seen the original series yet (as of writing this review), I was definitely hooked. If I remember\r\ncorrectly, it was around the 5th or the sth episode were it all clicked for me, but going back, the first episodes were\r\nvery high quality too. I would definitely recommend diving into this series, especially for fantasy/mystery/action fans\r\nout there, watching the original does not really matter, it takes nothing out from the experience, and I would probably\r\nguess that it's the proper way to experience the series.\n"

            "content": "\n                For a show to be this praised yet this controversial definitely raises a lot of red flags and scares away any potential fans, but also, for the curious people, it does attract the better exploratory side of them and pushes them to go in, open-minded, and decide for themselves. That's how I went in, completely open to anything with a bit of disguised hesitation, but oh boy did I get rid of any faint traces of regrets during the first 10 minutes of the first episode.\n\r\nStory: (8.6/10):\r\nWe all know a good first episode is what makes the biggest impression for an entire season, a badone hurts the name of the show, and a good one no matter how awful the series gets afterward does keep up the buzz and roll-down conversations.\r\nIn Beastars' case, from the very first moments, we are already invested by being presented with a murder mystery and a setting that sounds very familiar and yet so new and refreshing with an uncanny resemblance to the real world.\r\nHighschool Anime is probably the biggest over the saturated setting in the medium, probably because of the audience target, but not every high school drama can relate to everyone no matter the age gap which makes it a hit or miss for most people, Beastars comes with its own twist, big enough to leave an impact.\r\nManifesting the characters as animals was a genius 4-head move as it only amplifies and highlights gruesome real-world problems like racism, slavery, unfair prejudice, and self-discovering. A truer than words coming of age story.\n\r\nArt: (9/10):\r\nSo we all know how unforgiving the fandom is towards CGI use in Anime, after all, it started as a 2D plain of storytelling but one cannot undertake the changes the medium knew over the years, and CGI is definitely one of the most hated and controversial techniques known to the fans, and most of the hate comes from the poor implementation of said technique, however, Beastars is here to re-evaluate this statement showing how varying CGI can bring to storytelling in Anime, being from creative lighting techniques, dynamic camera angles and artistic use of shading.\r\nThe character design was great and in sync with the voice acting, the facial expressions were very good and on point and so were the movements and all of the gestures performed by the characters, lying perfectly between human performance and its anima counterpart.\n\r\nSound: (9.2/10):\r\nBeing a Netflix show really has a special vibe attached to it, the voice acting especially sounds better than your generic highschool drama Anime. Despite being animals in human clothing, the pattern of speech and the emotion leaking with every spoken word is more human than anything else in the show.\r\nThe OSTs were great and the opening and endings were even greater.\n\r\nCharacters: (8.5/10):\r\nEvery season has that one character everyone hates and loathes, but Beastars defies the seasonal norms yet again with a lively, dramatic cast of characters with different backgrounds and hardships, unique treats, and characteristics, each with their own motives and compassion.\r\nLegoshi is a fantastic protagonist that you don't always see in similar Anime, him being a wolf, a \u201clone-wolf\u201d, if you will, really complements his loneliness and emptiness that drives his animal shell that carries his human heart and Luis is just the best playing his antagonistic role better than anyone from my recent memory with his beautiful pair of antlers that almost scratch ceilings, symbolizing the burden of the expectations and hopes that other people have for him.\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10):\r\nI hate this expression, I hate how it reads, how it sounds, and how it's grammatically composed, but ever since I finished the first two episodes it started echoing in my busy head endlessly. \u201cThis show hits different\u201d.\r\nNo, hear me out, I'm not a high schooler, and definitely not an animal, but for this to relate to me the way it did definitely says a lot of things, good things. I guess it did take a bunch of animals and a drama club for me to fulfill my long-lasted itch for a good drama. Nonstop suspense and anticipation the likes of which leave an impression for a lifetime, and now that I have finished Beastars I can finally say, \u201cI get it\u201d.\n\r\nOverall: (9.06/10)\r\nBeastars is a one in every year show, it comes off as a strange, kinky, and misleading premise that throws most people off, but at the core, it criticizes the very same stereotyping of thinking, only adding to the irony that it both surrounds and surrounded by.\n"

            "content": "\n                FLCL, Fooly Cooly, Furi Kuri, call it whatever you want, exactly, everyone understands this show the way they want, this is the type of shows that require you several rewatches before you start trusting yourself on what you grasped so far from the anime, it's not a matter of being slow to understand, or not in the mood for watching, let's put it this way, are you high enough for this anime? no, but seriously, I dove in with no expectations, zero backgrounds, starting an anime like every other, how naive I was.\r\nNow, I watched a lot of weird shit, including anime, but I havenever, and I repeat, ever seen something this weird in my entire life, but weird, doesn't always mean bad, and I had to learn it the hard way...\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nUnlike what most of the viewers might say, yes, there is a story and a deep one in fact. You really have to be fully focused on what's going on, because the authors like to present the story in a very unique, but weird manner, it almost looks like juxtaposition a bunch of nonsense and hardcoding a storyline that barely makes sense most of the time, if it ever does, but trust me on this, this is an animated METAPHOR, and a great one that we all can relate to.\n\r\nThe story follows the main protagonist, a stereotypical boy in elementary school, still on the crucial evolving into the creature we all are and/or once were, a teenager, Takkun, as he's referred to by several of the characters, is a boy dying of boredom in his small town, that nothing out of the ordinary ever happens at, he feels so empty spending time with his brother's girlfriend who went away from home to follow his dreams.\n\r\nThe events of the story will, for the most part, mock-up and ridicule all sorts of aspect that we get to experience while growing up, and surprisingly enough, sexual content is a huge part of it. if you really thought about it, this is a story about overcoming the differences, depression is the real cancer, and curing that, requires a strong heart indeed.\n\r\n- Art (9.5/10):\r\nWhere to even start in this one, goes to show, that shows these days have no excuse for slacking off, (looking at you One Piece and folks).\r\nFor the longest time, I've been a collector of aesthetic pictures and GIFs, those images that really make you stare at them and melting in your thoughts, this show is like a mine where there's nothing but the sweet rare aesthetics, where you could pause any episode, and have a chance of 90% to capture a wonderful aesthetic image.\r\nThe animation and art style does vary alongside the story's progression, at times even parodying some popular shows like South Park.\n\r\n- Sound (10.0/10):\r\nMost definitely, the strongest aspect, and the part that makes it dozens of times better than its competitors, every single song (and there is a wide selection to go through) is fantastic as a standalone record, but they way they easily blend and compliment the yet very unique art style and fluid animation is just luxurious on its own.\n\r\n- Character (7.5/10):\r\nNot so many great characters really, with only 6 episodes available, and the very fast paced nature of the show, it's reall hard to get to know the characters very well, but similar to the speed of the story, the character developmenet is also a killer actor here, one in particular that drew me in the most, was the girl called Mamimi, she struggles with forgetting the past, getting over what happened with her ex, and her crazy addiction to smoking are relatable in a sense, and I'm not a smoker myself, and never been, and yet, there is a connection about redemption, are we all fair in love and war? who knows, but we are all tasting the same bitter aroma of hardship.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nSaying I didn't enjoy the show would be a sin to keep ahold of, there are a lot of flaws here and there, we can't neglect what's the show really excels at, for once, the music is just spectacular, what else? the animations are just as complementary to that, enough to keep your brain busy on the screen, people might get easily bored with the simplistic story in the display, and don't let the excessive sexual content at times distract you from the real message\u201cS\u201d, this was an amazing ride, a shame it's not that family friendly, or else, I was going to straight rewatch it with friends and family.\n\r\n- Overall (8.4/10):\r\nDefinitely worth a rewatch several times, because as I stated before, it's really hard to follow and keep track with the progression of the story, and that's apparent from the first watch, a third or maybe a fourth would get me to understand better, and probably by then, I would even have a different read on this, but as for now, it had an effect on me, how to view things currently I'm living through, It's been a great binge-watch.\n"

            "content": "\n                Disclaimer: Minor plot spoilers below!\n\r\nLet's all agree that every season has that show that everyone talks about until the season ends, but even among those, there are the ones that make conversations 10 years later. It is with no doubts, along with a few other shows, Sword Art Online was like a nuclear bomb in the industry, not only making a huge name for itself but also revolutionized the Isekai genre that we still get the most out of even to this day every season. SAO, as far as we've gotten, is a modern classic, and no, this is no RE:Creators either.\n\r\nI guess, during theyears I've watched Anime, I knew enough about the show even without having to watch it, I have watched several Isekai that serialized after SAO, but SAO never had the appeal to attract me, that is, until I got addicted to MMORPGs, just until when I will give this landmark of a show a try, it's almost 10 years now, everybody knows about it. So here goes nothing.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nPrior to starting the show, I went in with completely zero expectation, thanks to the popular hate the franchise received, yeah I said, it's definitely going to be just another average screening.\r\nI have to give it to SAO though, it was one of the first in the genre to explode, so I probably shouldn't nag too long on every clich\u00e9 trope that makes most of it for the sake of its age.\r\nI really prefer this idea of trapped in a game more than the over-saturated otherworldly teleport, it has more grounding on the real world, and with the rise of VR technology in the recent years, it's actually closer to real-life than most other Isekai.\n\r\nThe show runs through two arcs, the first one, and the more popular one, the Aincrad arc which spans a total of 14 episodes, well, from what I've seen, almost every little praise the show gets is because of this arc, and I can see it. It establishes the identity of the series from the get-go, gives you a basic setup of what's going on which several episodic short min-arcs that build up on top of each other.\n\r\nThe second arc, the Fairy Dance arc is a controversial one. Many people claim that the show was better-off ending on episode 14 \u201cEnd of the World\u201d, well, I can kind of agree on the questionable ending to the Aincrad arc, however, 2 episodes into the arc you really get the feeling of the new atmosphere. New game, and a new adventure in ALfheim Online. I really liked this arc, unlike what the popular opinion says, I found the drama to be superior, maybe the stakes weren't as high as the first arc, but I really liked the shift from focusing on in-game avatars to switching a great deal of the focus on the people behind that avatar. To make it short, Kirito's relationship with his step-sister had more weight and interest than anything that happened prior to it.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nFor a show from 2011, I would say, throughout the year, we've seen better. Visually speaking. That's not saying that SAO was an amateur fest. The dialogue chill sequences look very generic, nothing that piques the interest, the characters are very static, the backgrounds are just good enough. The action sequences, however, had all the budget thrown into them apparently.\n\r\nThe character designs are very bareboned, at least, until the Fairy Dance arc where we get more vibrant and fun characters. Kirito as the main character looks like every generic background crowd character, he doesn't stand out even among the dullest wooden planks. Asuna is distinguishable enough, I would say, the supporting cast is more visually unique from their surroundings.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nI loved the vocals in this show.\r\nFirst of all, the opening and ending sequences are just beautiful, I have listened to them out of the blue on several youtube videos in the past years, but this time, I had to experience them the proper way. The songs themselves are very good and match the theme of their story arcs perfectly, I would say, the first opening is just so iconic at this point, but I think I prefer the second one. The ending songs are also very good and fun to listen to.\n\r\nThe OST fits a fantasy game very well, it doesn't get in the way. The voice acting was subtle and fine, nothing really praise or anything. I think I really got used to Asuna's and Kirito's voices since their very first appearance.\n\r\n- Characters (7/10):\r\nWell, we all heard the Kirito protagonist jokes. The dude has even made to be the stable benchmark for shitty Isekai characters in all sorts of reviews, but I would say, I failed to pinpoint what it was.\r\nPerhaps, I just got used to the fact that the newer Isekai shows have way more underdeveloped, uninteresting protagonists, Kirito, in comparison at least, is a decent stand-up as the cool, kind-hearted kid that never gives up on saving his friends.\r\nAsuna, however, is a completely different deal. It's very rare that we get usefully capable female characters in similar shows, and for a blue-print for the later shows, Asuna does a lot that the rest miss on.\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is interesting enough to stay relevant, although they don't get much of screentime, they undertake proper character development and turn for the better.\n\r\nThe villains are probably the weakest thing that's holding down SAO in my opinion. Kayaba Akihiko was a good mystery for the better half of the show, but then, his motives were probably the most anti-climactic thing that anyone can come up with. And then, the rapey creep that took on the role of the villain in the Fairy Dance arc. If the writers wanted us to hate his guts, then they did a great job, but not because of how great of a villain he was, it was his pathetic creepy side that did not please the eye.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI enjoyed this way more than I anticipated.\r\nIt's been very long since the last time I sat down and binged a bunch of episodes back to back, something like hoarding 25 episodes in 3 days is unheard even in my thoughts, but I was somehow able to fit that in my messy schedule.\r\nI really liked the characters, I enjoyed the action and I appreciated the grind. I still don't get the hate behind this show, it still screwed sometimes but at the end of the day, it was quite the wild ride.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nIf you're into Isekai, especially if you're the type of viewer that munch on the seasonal Isekai trash, try going back to the roots for once in a while. For the initiator of this great era of Isekai, it really has less in common than you'd expect that it appears like a great show compared to stuff like Conception or Isekai Magician Cheat. Watch it.\n"

School Days ONA is a pointless retelling to the first episode of the original series, just a complete replica with no extra effort put on neither the animation, not the audio work and the reason behind it is still just as oblivious.\r\nNow Ilike my School Days as much as the next guy (probably not), but this, this was just utterly despicable to put as a standalone release, unless you haven't seen the show in ages and just wanted a quick reminder on how it all started, I'd suggest keeping all the distance you can from this low-level trash. I'm still haunted by how awful the animation is that I'd swear the pixels are easily countable within the range of any first-grader.

For a One Piece episode, movie, filler, OVA, ONA, special, anything, this was on the lowly low. I'm of course excusing the art department in this one as the time period of its release was never famous for that, it's the setting that was lacking, the oddness, the randomness, the goofiness, it wasn't there.\n\r\nWhen starting to watch any One Piece related content, you always come preparedto see some giant cheek clapping (Meaning it in an SFW way), colossal occupies dancing, eerie monsters walking down the street, reading a paper may be, it is always something out of the norm, but this was was a complete disappointment when it came to that, the only goofy thing was the villain's hairstyle, and it was not enough.\n"

            "content": "\n                As someone who loves Boku no Hero Academia and anime music, I have to say that Eve's song \"Bokurano\" is one of the best openings of the series. The song is so catchy and upbeat, and it perfectly captures the spirit of the show. It's one of those songs that you just can't help but sing along to, even if you don't understand the lyrics.\n\r\nThe music video for \"Bokurano\" is also really cool. It's a simple animation of Eve's character singing and dancing against a black and white background, but it's really effective. The animation is smooth and fluid, and it perfectly matches the energyof the song. It's just a really fun and visually appealing music video.\n\r\nBut let's talk about the song itself. \"Bokurano\" is a great song because it perfectly captures the themes and emotions of Boku no Hero Academia. The song is all about finding strength in yourself and in your friends, and that's what the show is all about. It's about a group of young heroes who are trying to save the world, but they can't do it alone. They need each other's help and support, and that's what makes them strong.\n\r\nThe lyrics of \"Bokurano\" are also really powerful. They're all about standing up for what you believe in, even when things are tough. The chorus of the song is especially memorable, with its refrain of \"we are not alone.\" It's a message of hope and solidarity that really resonates with the show's themes.\n\r\nOverall, I think that \"Bokurano\" is a fantastic opening for Boku no Hero Academia. It's a great song that perfectly captures the spirit of the show, and the music video is a lot of fun to watch. If you're a fan of anime music, or just a fan of Boku no Hero Academia, then you should definitely check out \"Bokurano.\" It's one of the best openings of the series, and it's definitely worth a listen.\n"

Extremely raw, straight to the point tight related fan service, the teasing is justas strong as ever, but still gets nowhere as exciting as the legendary episode 7 of the parent show.\r\nThe animation quality and the voice acting are not extinguishable from that of the Anime's, it's almost it was one pack with the rest and was only decided that it would be left out as extra for the hungry fans later.\n\r\nBut all in all, it was just another 4 minutes long scrabble with tights stretching and erotic camera angles.

            "content": "\n                With being both unique but in the same time a bit cheesy show, Noragami manages to approach a lot of stuff in a clever way while trying to portray its own story, loneliness and severe depression that drive people to consider suicide is a serious problem, especially nowadays, people tend to let go of their lives so easily with no deep consideration, thinking that they will find an escape in dying, but that's only after they forsake God, Noragami presents a world that has several gods, much like the ancient cultures, where you have for every aspect a God, for instance, God of health, Godsof war, and so on..., and it also goes deeper and focuses on even more common social phenomena like teenage rebellious behavior and what not. This is a dark tale, but with light-hearted comedy half of the time, but yet remains to be serious the other half, this is the telling about a long forgotten God!\n\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nYato, is the God of war that became to be forgotten in the modern world, seeing how people started having faith in science when dealing with war and conflict rather than praying to that one divine being that used to grant wicked wishes, and keep the blood flow going, which he is saving up a budget from doing several every-day tasks for 5-yen in order to build himself a shrine of his own, he gets to meet this very interesting girl, Iki Hyori who got herself involved with him unwillingly in a chain of events that changed her view on life.\r\nAlong the way, Yato gets an acquaintance, a young boy who has yet to meet somebody who guides him the right way, rebellion can be really tough on both sides, but at the end, gentle words can patch up the deepest injuries of the heart.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nAbsolutely stunning, In most modern anime shows, the quality of the animation tends to lower few episodes in, but that was not the case with Noragami. With this series, I got to see some of the best drawn male figures to date, I mean, take the protagonists, Yato's eyes are just beautiful and so wonderful to look at, so blue they can distract you from the action going on display.\r\nThe animation was fluid, almost flawless, never noticeable sluggish or lazy, and let's not forget about the backgrounds, the details are just on point, all the lighting and shadows, ugh, just perfect.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI could go all day praising the wonderful opening and end them songs, probably the most thing I'm going to miss after finishing this up.\r\nthe protagonist's voice actor, is the astonishing Kamiya Hiroshi, who also voices the beloved (Levi in Attack on Titan) and (Law in One Piece) and many other popular characters is doing a fine job with this role, balancing between the serious voice tone and carefree comedic tones amazingly, the soundtrack was okay for the most part.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThe character rooster here is not that big, but remains very consistent to the storytelling, Yato is just greatness over greatness for a protagonist, I don't think I've ever complained or disliked his decisions, so smooth and easy going, a very likable and mysteriously interesting character with a lot for him to say than appears on the surface.\r\nThere are other annoying characters too, but they are upon improvement later on, which is a payoff in itself.\r\nAside from the main cast, the side characters are also rich and intriguing too, it gets you begging for more screen time for them.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nI really enjoyed this watch, I was brought here because of a random encounter with the series's opening theme song, but the story and characters were what kept me hooked till the end, I even got to finish this in 3 days, with is rarely ever to happen for me lately, I know it's too much for a 12 episodes long series, but for my tight schedule, I had to postpone some more important stuff just to follow along this.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nI would totally recommend this series, at least for now, I know I have a new trump card in my disposal when discussing anime series with friends, the series while having some minor fanservice, and I repeat, very minor, it's safe to watch it with friends and family.\n"

            "content": "\n                \u201cAngel Beats\u201d, more like how to abuse people to death 2.0, the parent series was never a pleasant memory for me, not because how amazingly sad it was (Clannad style), but how it really sucked in my eyes. I would constantly see people praising the hell out of it, and then reflect on myself, should I give it another chance? Yeah, maybe I should, maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it when I first watched it, and thus, was the reason I never enjoyed it. A big no-no is what you get sir, this couple of OVAs reminded me on why I reallyfeel disgusted towards the show, why I think it should have never existed in the first place. Keep in mind that these couple of episodes are spoiler free, the first episode takes place after the second episode of the parent series, and the second one after the fourth episode of the parent series.\n\r\n- Story (2/10):\r\nYou know how crappy OVAs can be, but not all of them are this bad.\r\nAs if the wackiness of the parent series wasn't enough, they for so long explaining on how they all died for the sake of some dream and all, while in the same breath exploit their ability to be resurrected just to that they can put them to rest a moment later. I hated this approach of storytelling and making up excuses for bad and contradicting fourth wall breaking jokes. The story could stand out for a decent comedy if we were to remove all of the pointless death sentences and the wanna-be-sad attempts, it feels like that teenager that's confused on what to do and just want to sort their problems out, but can never decide on the right choices.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nIt's fine I guess, the art style, in general, feels very modern and holds up to this day, but what I really appreciate is the fuild animation on the fast-paced action moment, I really like the backgrounds, digital they may be, but they really look like a treasure mine for some Tumblr class wallpapers.\n\r\n- Sound (6/10):\r\nEnough to keep up with the direction of the animation, the voice acting isn't the best, but the opening and ending theme songs are one of the finest. The soundtrack was very hard to notice if there was one at all, but probably that was because of the distracting character cast that all jump into the screen, fighting desperately for a spotlight.\n\r\n- Characters (0/10):\r\nAbsolutely ridiculous, none of them make for a memorable figure. They go a long road calling the extras NPCs while they couldn't be more of hypocrites themselves, in fact, they were the NPCs with the horrible AI from a shitty Ubisoft game. For one, the main character doesn't look like a main, not in appearance not in his acts, in fact, some side characters do make up for better mains than himself.\r\nAll of the characters are just that boring with nothing to add but a desperate comic relief source, and they call it a sad show? They are nothing but a brutal punching bag for whenever they decide to murder somebody on screen for the heck of it, and did I mention that it makes up for 90% of every episode? No? Well, get this, Manhunt would be put to shame.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (2/10):\r\nI mainly enjoyed this for being an average refreshed on the direction of the show. It's been a long time since I last watched the parent series, and this special reminded me why I avoided rewatching it. This mediocre (at the very best) overrated piece of work that some people call a masterpiece was just an excuse to continuously kill off characters for the sake of amusement, how sadistic is that? I guess if there were people fetishizing on feet and sneezing, this wouldn't sound like an act weirdness. What a time to be alive.\n\r\n- Overall (3.5/10):\r\nI still feel like I was being generous with this review in favor of this OVA, I do not enjoy a similar lazy story direction, and I'm sure there are people who strongly disagree, I'm not going to call you off because of a show you like, everyone has their taste they think very high of, if you enjoy this genre, good for you, you might have found yet another show to binge, but as for me, this entire franchise is better off disposed off. Probably the trashiest work of Jun Maeda, and he's had some top tier stories under his name.\n"

            "content": "\n                \u201cGreat, another Isekai, just what we need\u201d. Pretty much my motto whenever I'm in the seasonal train. \u201cTensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken\u201d was the last Isekai that gave me a pat on the back and made me feel home around my Isekai hype again, I praised it on almost everything it presented, treated it like the pickle of the genre, the change we loathed ever since this mainstream pickle first debuted. A season later, \u201cTate no Yuusha no Nariagari\u201d had something else to say.\r\nSlime-kun was a relatively more creative and \u201cmore original\u201d take on Isekai, however, the Shield Hero nailed some stuff that even thelatter couldn't touch upon quite right, that is, proper character development as far as the protagonist goes.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nSummoned to another world (I'm sure we all know this part of ever Isekai better than we know the back of our hands), Naofumi and three other dudes are tasked to save the world they never asked to be involved with, with that being the only way they can go back to their worlds.\r\nThe story at the very beginning is just as generic as every other Isekai, the dudes get an explanation how this new world works, assigned a final goal each, and an unexpected turn of events unwraps. And with it, from the exact first episode, you get a fuzzy full-image of what the show could be like. Character development the likes we've not used to, especially at the very start of a series.\r\nThe very concept of stripping away every shred of power, dignity and pride from a character and then sitting through a full season of observations of how he overcomes all the odds really pays off, the pacing doesn't fall short of delivering a nicely timed sequence of events that help build what he lost back little by little, it's the same sense of achievement Slime-kun had all over again. Only a bit more satisfying.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nIn terms of visual fidelity, it definitely did not pull anything near the likes of \u201cViolet Evergarden\u201d, the art style and artworks look like any other Isekai, to be honest, just a modern average designs that fall back into using CGI very often for both background and characters (not a fan of that), it felt lazy at times, but when the action called for it, there was some strong Sakuga rage on the screen.\r\nThe character designs were blunt, only the heroes and important figures felt a bit more highlighted, probably thanks to the cool armory they were equipped with, pull that off and they look like every other fodder NPC.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nLet's just say that the first opening theme song was an absolute party banger. As for the second one, not on the same level, unfortunately, but instead, we got 2 gorgeous ending theme songs that really makes you think back on the burdens that have been projected on Naofumi throughout the story. They also make for beautiful lullabies on their own.\r\nThe sound acting I could say was amazing. I wouldn't ask for any better for an Isekai. A lot of emotion that had to be delivered, and the actors and actresses did not disappoint.\r\nThe only thing I felt a shortage of from what concerns anything vocal was the soundtrack, literally, the highlight of every MMO game (The selling point for these type of shows) is the memorable relaxing OSTs, sadly, the Shield Hero did not have a strong arsenal of that. It would have definitely made something good greater.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nYes please, my absolute favorite part of this show. Talking directly about the protagonist here. Naofumi started as the most clich\u00e9 Isekai protagonist the first shot he was introduced. Very naive, hype-active, go-lucky, but that changed faster than a blink when he pulled a semi-emo-edge lord transformation (for the right reason).\r\nRelatively, edgy characters don't tend to be the best ones, it has become like an excuse for obscuring characters and saving off an effort that could have went into expanding on their characteristics and treats, but not in this case, which I found very unique and different.\r\nSadly, not every character gets the same treatment, however, a large amount does by the end of the series and throughout.\r\nIf you like your fair share of Waifu and characters to protecc, you can definitely find yourself home with this show, I can't speak of much, but Raphtalia takes the cake in terms of popularity.\r\nOne of the most hated characters, like ever, makes a debut in this series, I find it a good thing for the kind of role she fills, she is supposed to be hated, and you can't help but find yourself on the verge of starting a cult dedicated to on purely directing every shred of hate to her.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nIt was definitely a turbulence in terms of sheer enjoyment while weekly watching the show. I can say with confidence that not all episodes are equal, the first 4/5 episodes were absolutely God tier, they give you an urge of settling with an overall score of 9, 9.5, or even a solid 10 (if you're feeling too generous), but it went kind of down after that on an average production rate until the 21st episodes, God that's another unexpected Godly episode, the likes of which that makes you put on another perfect score from what is presented of satisfactory execution, only to steep down a bit until it concludes. Those episodes were truly some of the best I've seen, and had it been as consistent throughout the serialization, it would have been one of the best adaptations ever made. No doubt.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\n\u201cTate no Yuusha no Nariagari\u201d, I can say with a smiley face, it was an absolutely refreshing experience for another seasonal Isekai, a lot of people may flee, only to realize the greatness they missed. It's not the best over-grounding story out there by any means, but if you're looking to be entertained and invested in the vast lore it houses, ripping your hair apart as you hate on an absolute slutty which and rooting for the Shield Hero to restore everything he lost.\n"

Maybe we were too harsh on him, maybe we shouldn't have said all of those negative things about his work, come to think of it, his original work was always good, but this one tops it off and showing his true potential.\n\r\nThat analogy is everything but SAO. The first project is the original series, people decided to hate on it, and to fatten the hate and ignorance, even more, the second season received the same if not a worse treatment, Alicization, in this case, is the second ambitious project that corrects all of the previous entries' faults, that is, until Mr. handyman, Reki Kawahara himself decides to add pieces of pineapples atop for some reason, and everything he built up fell off in an instant like it never even mattered.\r\nWhy pineapples? That is very random, yes, just like whatever happened in this season, it's stupid, it's random and very unnecessary.\n\r\nHere is why...\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nIt's undeniable the effort and dissection thought-out structure that Alicization started off with, very intriguing spin on the whole VR practices that had gone repetitive on the previous entries until it ended off with a satisfying conclusion that's very proud with the cliffhanger it concluded on, leaving us wanting and begging for a continuation, something that really put a lot of pressure on the continuation, it has to be at least as good or else, what does it even matter.\n\r\nSomething I really want to admire this season for bravely doing, and somewhat nailing was the shift from focusing on Kirito as the main motivator for the plot's progression to other lesser characters.\r\nNow, for the frustrating part. What happened to common sense and careful thinking?\r\nNow, SAO has always had some very visible plot holes that honestly do not affect the way the plot runs and is set up as, there are a few things here and there, but this season upped that up a great deal. A great but frustrating example was the whole Soul Translator gear and the exclusivity to the Underworld that makes you wonder if the writer even cares any more. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go on more detail of how exactly that hurt the credibility of this story, but man, did that single-handedly drop this plot from an 8/10 to a rediculous 6/10.\r\nHonestly, despicable.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nLately, A1-Picture has been stepping up their game with SAO, and it shows clearly in the couple last seasons. You thought the last season was phenomenally animated, this one is straight-up MAD sakuga compilations at this point, big and hype fights every episode, something that really calls out the talent of the animation team.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nI praised the OST for the first time in Alicization. Did they improve even more or what? Maybe because this one relied on a lot of battle and combat to sellout the plot, that is, a lot of impact shocks, piercings and magic chants to compose, they definitely stick out the most.\r\nUnlike the previous entries, the opening was okay, however, the ending though, definitely the best in the series from what goes from visuals and song. LISA is such a talented individual.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nMaybe the selling point of this show. The Kirito boycott if you will.\r\nNo, but seriously, to take out the main character of the entire franchise and still have a solid plot that's round-out very well (until the last two episodes that is) goes to show how amazing the side supporting characters are. Not only the human knights but also the Dark Territory soldiers. Every fluctlight individual sold his or her role perfectly, having to empathize with both sides can only be explained by the great character development and good personified writing if anything. It goes to question, would be born on the wrong piece of land make you the bad guy? Are the humans the heroes here because we, the viewers are humans ourselves, and though, it's easier to relate to what's familiar?\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nMy journey with SAO started with that of curiosity, why is this series hated so much, and why is it, despite that, so popular. I have come to compose my own relationship with SAO, a hate and love relationship that's primarily driven from my disappointment. I wanted the franchise to be good because it really had the potential to be amazingly good.\r\nWhen I first watched Alicization I had a great deal of happiness because finally, this series is being set on the perfect track, but then to see the much-awaited for sequel destroy all of that really hurt the experience, it's not that I hated the season from the get-go, I actually enjoyed it, although not as much as I enjoyed Alicization, it wasn't until the last two episodes when I just couldn't deal with the stupid twists, they really ruined the mood and let me in such severe disappointment.\n\r\nWith that out of the way, this season, or war if you will have some great moments for all sorts of characters from both sides of the conflict. We get to see a lot of their abilities, attitudes, aspirations, it was a great shift from a solo character-focused series to a group of people, each with different goals in life.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nI mean, if you're considering watching this, you've already made it through the best, the bad, and the stupid of SAO, 12 more episodes to seal off the series (for now) isn't going to be a bad investment, but it's by no means perfect. It leaves out a lot to be desired, doesn't live up to the hype. Definitely the same SAO though, just more action and stripped out politics.\n"

            "content": "\n                When I first heard about \"Ajin: Demi-Human\", I'll admit, I wasn't exactly excited to watch it. The premise seemed a bit too familiar and the promotional materials didn't exactly scream \"originality.\" But boy, was I in for a surprise.\n\r\nFirst off, the animation is top-notch. The CGI is seamless and really adds to the overall aesthetic of the show. It's clear that a lot of care and attention was put into the animation, and it really pays off. But let's be real, what really makes or breaks an anime is the story, and \"Ajin\" delivers in spades. From the very first episode, I was hooked. Theplot is full of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat, and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.\n\r\nThe characters are also a highlight of the show. At first, they may seem a bit uninspired, but as the story progresses, they really start to come into their own. Each character has their own unique backstory and motivations, and watching them grow and change throughout the series was a real treat.\n\r\nBut what really sets \"Ajin\" apart from other anime in the same genre is the way it tackles the themes of identity and humanity. The show raises some thought-provoking questions about what it means to be human, and how society reacts to those who are different. It's a subject that's been explored in other anime before, but \"Ajin\" manages to bring a fresh perspective to the table.\n\r\nWith all that said, I highly recommend \"Ajin: Demi-Human\" to anyone looking for a well-animated, thought-provoking anime with a great story and well-developed characters. It's a show that exceeded my expectations and left me wanting more. And with Netflix streaming the show globally, it's easier than ever to give it a watch and see for yourself.\n\r\nOverall: 7.86/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                \"Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari\" (The Rising of the Shield Hero) Season 3 thrusts viewers back into the fantasy realm where Naofumi, the Shield Hero, finds no respite. Fresh from his victory over the Spirit Tortoise, he is immediately plunged into a new crisis: the disappearance of the other Cardinal Heroes and the looming threat of another Guardian Beast. This season attempts to weave these elements into a narrative that's ambitious, yet feels too familiar in its execution.\n\r\nThe story's progression in this season, while better than its predecessor, does not quite recapture the initial allure that the first season offered. It's a journey filled withhigh stakes and a sense of urgency, but it occasionally stumbles, lacking the depth and innovation that could have elevated it. However, it remains a competent continuation, successfully maintaining the series' core themes and providing a few twists that keep the audience engaged.\n\r\nVisually, the anime remains a paradox. On one hand, the 2D animation is remarkable, with fluid action sequences and detailed environments that bring the world to life. Yet, this excellence in 2D contrasts sharply with the 3D animation, which continues to be the Achilles' heel of the series. The jarring blend of the two styles often detracts from the overall visual experience, though it doesn't completely mar the aesthetic appeal of the series.\n\r\nThe sound department, particularly the opening theme, is a standout aspect of this season. It's dynamic, energizing, and perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the show. The overall sound design complements the series well, enhancing both the action scenes and the more subdued moments with a fitting score.\n\r\nCharacter development, or the lack thereof, is a significant shortfall in this season. While Naofumi's character remains engaging, the development of other characters, especially the new ones introduced, feels underwhelming. This lack of depth in characterization hinders the emotional connection with the story, making some interactions feel forced or superficial.\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, the season is a mixed bag. It has moments that are genuinely captivating, especially for fans who have followed Naofumi's journey from the beginning. However, these moments are interspersed with segments that feel like a retread of previous plots, making the viewing experience somewhat inconsistent.\n\r\n\"Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari\" Season 3, while not reaching the heights of the series' debut, still offers enough to keep fans coming back. It's a continuation that tries to balance its established formula with new challenges, and while it doesn't always succeed, it's a journey worth following for those invested in Naofumi's world. The series, with its striking 2D animation and compelling soundtrack, coupled with a storyline that remains engaging albeit familiar, manages to hold its ground, even as it struggles to fully realize its potential.\n\r\noverall: 6.3/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Oh boy, it's getting controversial and heated in here, that's what everybody said when it was revealed that JC Staff studio was behind the latest sequel of the massively popular One Punch Man. For a sequel that everybody was anticipating for a couple of years, it was way too big of a disappointment when the shocking announcement was made, and it even got more aggressive when the first teaser trailer first dropped. We're a bunch of scumbags, aren't we?\r\nIt's not clear who's to blame, but, the studios will not pull off a budget-busting production just like that, especially when a smaller one is involved, itwas never going to be on the same level of MAD house's adaptation, and we all knew it, but we still watched every episode on a weekly basis, and, was it really that bad?\n\r\n- Story (8.2/10):\r\nSurprisingly, I would root for this sequel as the better at storytelling, for what we've seen in the first season from blood-boiling action, it lacked a massive fuppa when it came to solid sequential storytelling, but it was never about that, and that's why it was so good nevertheless.\r\nOne Punch Man season 2 had less of Saitama himself and more of the other characters that fell under the \u201csidekick\u201d label in the first season, both heroes, civilians, and monsters, all had varying storylines, convincing backstories and overarching motives, we get to see that not every hero wears a cape, and not every monster has fans and horns, it was in a way an ideological clash between several characters, each crossing a uniquely defined path with Saitama as a neutral figure in the middle of it, with as minimal of a highlight as possible, leading to some great opportunities for other characters to shine.\n\r\n-  Art (8.1/10):\r\nLet's be honest guys, it was not that bad, if anything, just a few refinements from being a solid MAD-house-inferior piece of work, visually speaking of course.\r\nThe first three episodes had some amazing compositions and great production values, and then it seemed to have dimmed down a bit only for it to hit the peak at the very last 3 episode that you'd swear they had some other high budget studios take over the animation process.\r\nThe art style suffered a bit from the studio change, the colors now look way brighter and Isekai-ish (JC Staff leaving their mark), they gave off Saitama a weird gradient tint on his glorious bald head, which for the better or worse looks like that familiar pattern used on Anime girls' melons that works as a highlighter to their curvy meat, if you will.\r\nGenos, on the other hand, looked like a beaten up dollar store version of the one from the first season, I have nothing in defense of that, and pretty much everybody else looked normally consistent.\r\nI'm not going to lie, had the first season had the same kind of visual production value, nobody would have complained, everyone is just so held up on how much MAD house spoiled us with that Godly quality that they forget what really made this show great.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nFor an action-heavy punching simulator, you better bet the overloading screams and shouting is going to make for the majority of the dialogue is going to be just that. And it was amazing. Filled with an aggressive collective tone that complimented the monologues and word-shaming and made the battles even greater.\r\nI was massively disappointed with both the opening and the ending theme songs, they just lacked cohesive rhythms they almost made me watch to skip them. Like, where is iconic \u201cOne Puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunch\u201d at the beginning of every episode?\n\r\n- Character (8.7/10):\r\nThe best part about this season is the phenomenal character development and background breaks we had, something the first season lacked to the very core. Saitama for once had probably less screentime than some characters and for a great reason. It gave a chance for characters like other minor heroes, civilians and even villains (King, Suiryu, Garou...), it was just so well put down with the pace of the story, having all of them well connected to one another. A great example of how Saitama had always greatly affected the lives of most other heroes, it even haunted me with the theory of whether the hero Blast is really Saitama himself, but you never know.\r\nCharacter arcs go to such degree so as to have the show completely change its perspective on the world and everything depends on the character standing in the spotlight, a great example for this is how Suiryu, a strong martial art that looks down on the hero gets to live through an experience that changes all of that, or how Garou, a figure close to being the hero of his own show, go all out hunting heroes for some reason he thinks is just.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI personally had quite the blast, sure I missed the God tier animation that spanned whole episodes, but the show was never about the jaw-dropping animation, that was just a small part on what made the original a must watch. The universe of One Punch Man is just so written that it puts all the \u201cOverpowered protagonists are shallow and boring and they affect the story in a negative way\u201d to naught. Saitama is just ultimate strength itself, but the show still puts you into anticipation for other things that you don't even notice. What an entertaining watch it was.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nIf you've already enjoyed the first season, please just check this sequel out, if you're going about the same old JC Staff hate then just knock off your narrow shell and give it a try, it retains everything that made the first season a massive blow and it's just sad to see fans bash on it with a disgusted expression.\n"

No tangents, I promise.\n\r\nFirst off, let's talk about the visuals. They are undeniably great. The animation and artistry of the music video really captured the essence of the original song and added a unique flair to it. It's evident that a lot of effort went into creating a visually stunning experience that complements the music.\n\r\nNow, onto the music itself. While there may be differing opinions, I want to highlight the positive aspects of this entry. The artistshowcased their own interpretation of the song, even though they were the original authors for it, bringing their own style and flair to the table. It's always interesting to see different takes on a beloved track, as it can offer a fresh perspective and introduce new elements to the music.\n\r\nDespite any personal preferences or comparisons to other versions, it's important to appreciate the passion and creativity behind this cover. The artist brought their own strengths to the performance, and that deserves recognition. The dedication to create a compelling rendition should be applauded, as it adds another layer of artistic expression to the anime community.\n\r\nIn the end, while there may be discussions about which version is considered the best, it's essential to remember that music, like any form of art, is subjective. It's wonderful to see artists exploring and reimagining popular songs within the anime world, as it showcases the diverse talents and creativity within the community.\n\r\nSo, let's focus on the positive aspects of this reviewed entry - the impressive visuals and the artist's unique interpretation of the song. It's an opportunity to appreciate the artistic expression and the effort put into creating a visually appealing and musically engaging experience for fans.\n"

            "content": "\n                Akame ga Kill!, more like e-- okay, let's keep this spoiler free, alright?\r\nWith the large quantity of light-hearted slice of life shows we get every season, very few can get distinguishable as they touch a very hard aspect to nail in storytelling, that is, darkness and gore, emphasizing the point of people can die, as fragile as humans can be. Akame ga Kill! does just that, in fact, the fans would go as long as calling it a revolutionary step in the world of anime, just because it was as edgy as fueling up a killstreak throughout the entirety of the show while at thesame time closing an eye on how shitty the show really is.\n\r\n- Story (5/10):\r\nIn short, you have a corrupt empire, the typical immature emperor that's being controlled by his right-hand man into making his people suffer in despair. A faction known as the revolutionary army is working against throwing down the current imperial system to free the people. Allied with the revolutionaries a small group of assassins called the Night Raids, that's where the main characters reside.\r\nTatsumi, a naive go luck typical virgin protagonist is finally making his way to the capital with his childhood friends in order to join the imperial army and work for the empire until he gets wrapped up into some mess and finally decides to join the Night Raids instead after seeing how gruesome the empire really is.\r\nThe pacing of the story couldn't be any faster, like seriously, 3 episodes maximum can hold so many information and events that could be arranged as its own arc, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it rushes so many stuff and causes a lot of bad turns to the story that nothing really matters at the end, speaking about the characters here, let's discuss it more in depth later. As of writing this, I'm really holding my self back to not turn it into a rant and keep it as professional as I can. The world building on its entirety was absent,  we just get thrown into this magical world with superpowers and beasts with no introductory information and that's it, there is no recognizable spacial expansion of any sort, we get only to see some parts of the capital and the hideout of the Night Raids. Characters kind of come and go with no motives whatsoever like pins of bowling, it's infuriating. The power scaling couldn't be any more broken than it already is. It consists of ancient artifacts made from rare ingredients a thousand years ago, called imperial relics, several characters possess these mighty weapons, and yet, even after setting a clear image of how strong a relic is, they go ahead and pull off some nonsense plot armor instant powerups with no hesitation, like how can a commoner relic against a legendary one, of course, the protagonist will have victory even though having an inferior relic.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nA word to sum this shortly, it was beautiful. The art style was a mix between what you'd normally see in an Isekai and a Highschool anime. Given the genre of this show, the gore is apparently a huge part of it, and for that, they did blood animation justice, not 100% of the time, but mostly all of the time.\r\nOverall, the backgrounds were kind of meh, generic, but enough to keep you wondering.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI surprised that none of the two opening and ending theme songs disappointed me, I lived all of them mostly from the first time.\r\nThe voice acting was nailed almost perfectly, a lot of deaths caused a lot of grief, a thus, a lot of cries. The voice actors have done their parts really well (unlike the story).\n\r\n- Character (1/10):\r\nEw, That is just, not my cup of coffee. There was a tremendous amount of characters on the spotlight, introducing two rival factions, the Night Rads and the Jeagers forced the director of the show to alternate back and forth between the two to give every character some backing up, and that was to some degree a good thing to do. However, that wasn't enough to cover up on how flawed all of the characters are. I don't think there was any character worth of remembering other than being a punching bag for the excessive amount of fan service, despicable, and I'm being serious, most of the females are just a distraction for us the viewers, a magnet of fan service that tries as hard as it can to give value to certain female characters but fail miserably, that is, if you're using something else to spot the logic. The other counterpart lays on the absent character development, every single one remained the exact same the started like, and that was a generalization. You have characters like Esdeath that people would argue that they were of some high qualities. False, Esdeath was always bloodthirsty, she is either going on a kill streak or being a target to fan service, where is the depth in that? The more I talk about this the more apparent how poorly written they are, all look similar, screaming \u201cI have a bad backstory thus everything I do is justified and I should get some praise\u201d. That's not how it works mate.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.5/10):\r\nIt seems my tolerance is still soft and naive to give this an average score when it came to entertainment, I won't lie, the premise of the story was interesting from the get-go, but the execution was such a turn-off. There was enough action to keep me involved at least, but the absence of common sense did keep its deep marks.\r\nThe show created a philosophical approach to the whole conflict between the revolutionaries and the empire, like how everyone was striving to realize true peace but in different ways, making them both fight an enemy with more ideals and similarities than their thought.\n\r\n- Overall (5.8/10):\r\nIt would be a wise decision to skip up on this one, I would be lying if I told you it gets better or anything of this sort. The thing is, it has always been good, but the flow of how everything goes didn't do the story justice.\r\nI can at least tell you, that you will find no memorable characters, no deep story, and no hidden message at the end of it all, at least, not if you are using common sense and basic logic while you're watching. If you're into fanservice and that sort of stuff, then you'll get just that, but too much of it can really ruin big moments.\n"

But often, a not too much talked upon and completely out ofthe mainstream realm, a show that breaks through the generic modern Anime formula enters the chat, but as disappointing as reality often is, it's never enough for the other counterpart to leave the chat, and probably, for the better good.\r\nNow imagine that more simplified this time around. \u201cMononoke\u201d is not your typical Anime show, it's more of an abstract painting, not everyone will be into it, but the ones who do like to really pose in a snobby manner and identify as those with a noble-class taste, because Anime is art, and it's second nature for any form of art to touch upon sensitive and sometimes taboo topics in the stranger and most domestic approaches there is.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\n By its very definition, \u201cMononoke\u201d is an episodic series that center itself across several mini-arcs that can be taken out of context and be watched as a completely standalone run, no arc is restricted by the one before, everyone has all the freedom to explore different themes and stories and oversaturate them with heavy superstitial influence that really speaks something about the traditional Japanese folklore.\r\n It seems that the right way to review this series is to dedicate paragraphs for each mini-arc as they stand, it's the way to properly honor all of them, but who's going to read all of that? You're probably just waiting for the bit that sells the show for you so that you can give it a watch (and please do), hopefully.\r\n A reoccurring theme between all of the arcs though is the inclusion of women as the main victim figures, be it an objectified, mistreated wife that gets all the trash-talking from her husband or a passionate newswoman that faces humiliation and failure in her career because she's a woman, those are the devastating ingredients that can push hatred to new levels so inhuman that Mononoke (ghosts or evil spirits) take part in the conflict so great that a mysterious medicine seller whom we know no name of steals all the spotlights and act as a judging narrator.\r\n Together with the medicine seller' skills and with the help of people who may or may not willingly provide their \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cregret\u201d to have a shot at the Mononoke at hand. The pacing starts very, and extremely slow at first, it can even span the entire episode that you start doubting the newly started arc from being any more impressive, until some sort of crazy revelation hits and it's all an intense war-zone-like battle of survival, the twists can really turn a slow and sometimes uninteresting story to one of the most intense situations you'll ever experience watching an Anime.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nNot only \u201cMononoke\u201d took an unfamiliar way to steer around its plot, but it also embraced the traditional abstract-y art style that feeds off of bright colors and a completely diverse palette. There is also a regular emphasis on a static texture that layers the final visual product which makes the whole thing look like an animated piece of painting, the sort of stuff you'd see at Hogwarts.\r\n As the show tackles some of the more urban cases from the Japanese folklore, the classic Japanese art spreads its claws remarkable and remains one of if not the visual selling point of the show.\r\n As domestic as it is, the visual approach the production team went with works the best in favor of delivering the perfect imagery of what a ghost sighting might look like, something very superstitious and out of the ordinary would only feel out of place otherwise.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nA Japanese visual masterpiece can only have the best as its vocal first-mate. Exciting OST that screamed of Japanese were all over the place, bringing nourish to the background and action, so calm and relaxing at times, making you feel at home depending on the situation, and so aggressive and reek of danger when the stuff hits the fan.\r\nFor a show about evil spirits and ghost attack, you bet you're going have massive scream storming at you every climax of an arc, and those were so believable that you would think they have gone through the trouble of recording real-life audio of some public freakout moment to feed the show off of. And that also includes the sound effect pack.\r\nI can't speak for everyone here, but the medicine seller did it for me, his tone of voice perfectly complemented the mystery his eyes bore,  how can a man be so into the moment but still carry on a calm and steady tone if voice, easily one of my favorite voice acting performances.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nAgain, the medicine seller, emmmmm \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c, yes, more of that please, I mean, it's just a refreshing experience to watch a confident, calm and mature protagonist contribute to his story without being a tiny bit annoying to overdoing it, the whole arc would pass by and you'd still not notice his presence all that much, he leaves all the freaking out to the participating people and takes the prize single-handedly at the end. He is just too perfect. And his design? Yes, that's what I call original.\r\nToo bad not a lot of other characters inherit the same merits as the medicine seller, and the perfect justification lies on the nameless title, we don't get a backstory from the guy, no motives and no clues on what goes in his mind, we don't even get a name, and still, he makes almost the entirety of the show by just being there.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.3/10):\r\nI was mistaken to jump into the show in a binge-watch intent, but I learned that mid-way. It really takes a lot of effort to follow along with the complicated cross-pathing plot of Mononoke, for it a story with a lot of inns and outs, I'm not surprised that if I ended up missing the bigger part of the series, only to recover that back on my future rewatch (which are mandatory at this point).\r\nI would start every arc with a skeptical look on my face, with extremely low expectations, and I would be damned if I didn't bring up the slow pacing that overwraps every beginning of an arc, of course, that's my first impression, but not until the stakes shift and I'm all mind-blown dancing of intensity and praising what becomes of the rest of the arc.\n\r\n- Overall (8.76/10):\r\nA definitive recommendation is what you'll get from me, the show does a better job at so many many aspects of basic storytelling that more mainstream franchises end up sleeping on. \u201cMononoke\u201d truely is a series that gives, and keep on giving.\n"

            "content": "\n                One common running theme with Toei Animations is that you will never get a 100% satisfying adaptation that does the source material justice, well, there are some very few occasions where that doesn't apply, like the recent 3 movies and some of the major episodes of the show, but unfortunately One Piece: Episode of Sorajima could not level up to those exceptions. Talking about One Piece, we all have come to know that the anime adaptation gets its share of weekly beat up from the studio, the Manga and Anime are like night and day, two sides of the same coin that's one is waybelow the other in terms of quality. Not even the original adaptation of the Skypea arc from the anime from way back had managed to live up to the viewers' expectations and was infamously regarded by a great number of fans to be one of the worst arcs in term of pacing. But at least, this special does leave you appreciating how faithful the anime was to the source material when the Skypea arc was first animated.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nWe all know what the arc was about, so spare the lengthy introduction.\r\nWe all know Skypea was prequel'd by the beloved mini-arc Jaya, they just had to skip through 95% of it to rush into the sky island stuff, which is understandable enough, for instance, there are no light spots on either Teach or Bellamy, and let's, of course, no forget the two Monkey brothers that were affiliated with Montblanc Cricket, they were included on some still images though, but never were given any proper introduction. Not just that, but also many rememberable things were skipped liked the classic Zoro Tarazan screen (classic), and the scene where Wiper destroyed Enel with a reject Dial to only restart his heart and come back from the dead, we never got introduced to how the Skypeans live and how things are being ruled over up in the sky. Things like Ganfall meeting the straw hat and Satori fighting Luffy, Sanji and Ussop were changed entirely.\r\nEverything felt very out of place and in the wrong chronological order, sometimes you're put into a flashback, and then immediately skip a lot of (important) content to only find yourself following some of the major battles which almost all were only still images, that looked lazy, cheap, and more than anything else, disgraceful.\r\nOne of the greatest flashbacks of One Piece, the one that tells the story of Noland the lier, for me, it was the greatest thing and the most interesting part of Skypea, also, the most one packed with emotions, but here, it was just, why even bother. The storytelling was just a bunch of rushed conflicted nonsense being juxtaposed, if anything, it made me appreciate the older Anime adaptation more for what it was, simple of its time, but still lives up quite strong to date, if anything, better than this ordeal.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nYou'd figure that Toei Studio would put a greater effort into high budget projects like One Piece: Episode of Sorajima, but oh boy, not this time around.\r\nFrom the looks of it, they tried desperately to adopt the pre-time skip art style into an older part of the story and guess what, the results weren't pleasant at all. Everybody from the crew looks super weird for the most time, especially Robin, I wouldn't call that Robin to be fair, some kind of imperfect clone maybe? Imagine mixing Robin and Nami together, that what we got instead, looking at her \u201ccircular\u201d face was totally uncomfortable.\r\nI was looking forward to seeing some of the big moments animated with an up to date animation, I think I shouldn't have had any high expectations, I knew the old stuff will always have a special charm to it, but this we got wasn't even close. At best, if not being skipped like Enel vs. Wiper, we got some lazy still images and that was that.\n\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nI've always enjoyed the voice acting in One Piece, now those are people doing their jobs the way they should, no slopping and no laziness. Not only that, but the majority of the old soundtracks that we rarely ever get to hear nowadays make a return, and a strong one in fact filled with nostalgia.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nI'd hate to give this any lower score because everything was rushed, caught up in an incohesive mess, no character was given enough time to \u201cshine\u201d so to speak. I've talked how the backstories didn't make any great impact, and for that, from a new comer's perspective, not a single one of them made the cut.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (5/10):\r\nNow, I a big fan of One Piece, and I'm not being biased here, to say the least. I can shove up my face any content consisting One Piece all day, that's how big of a fan I am. Yes, the special was disappointing in a big way, they cut off a lot of my favorite parts, and changed a lot of things that were perfect before, and as the people in my profession say (I am a developer); if it works don't touch it. That quote should become universal and sacred, it can rescue franchises. I had my share of laughs here, It seems the minimal remaining of humor did endure the wounds of time. Classic One Piece.\n\r\n- Overall (6.7/10):\r\nIt all comes down to what you're expecting at the end. If you're waiting for some mind-blowing thing to happen, then don't. If you're waiting for this special to change your mind about the Skypea arc as a whole (because probably you're one of the people who didn't enjoy the arc in the first place), then it would most probably disappoint even more. But more importantly, if you're a newcomer, or a first-time watcher and still not caught up, and decided to skip the Anime arc and watch this instead as some sort of compensation, then I beg of you to not do so. This is as bad as a retelling can get, way more complicated than the Anime arc.\r\nIt was not one of the best specials of the series, it would probably rank down the chest somewhere.\n"

One Piece really changed throughout the years and this feels more like adocumentary than a recap.\n\r\nThere was also a weirdly placed promo for the Karakuri Castle movie (movie 7) before the Alabasta Robin part, but okay, probably a reminder that I should rewatch the One Piece movies for God knows what time now.\n"

To his surprise, the non-player characters in the game have developed personalities of their own, leading Momonga on a quest to uncover the truth behind this strange phenomenon.\n\r\nThe pacing of the story is moderate, giving enough time for the audience to digest the events and understand the characters' motivations.

The backgrounds, however, weren't that impressive, but it's forgivable, giving the fact you rarely move your eyes away from the characters.\n\r\n-Story (7.5/10)\r\nOK, this part is tricky, when first starting the show. The concept asa whole was and is still ridiculous and stupid, I mean, middle schoolers training to assassinate a mutated life form? Really? But it's not that bad considering the anime is a slice of life comedy (kinda), so the point is following characters who are developing along the way of the story progression, and on that part, the show did very well,\n\r\n-Characters (8/10)\r\nTremendous characters are introduced, and most if not all of them are main characters in some sort, they are all developed while the story progresses, have different treats, weak and strong points, and interesting personalities, however, the main character felt weird dare I say, he was not too forced neither was he uninteresting, in fact, you might debate that other supposedly (not mainly main characters) are better in each in appearance and charm.\n\r\n-Music (6.5/10)\r\nNothing too special, nor is it too bad, other than the openings and the ending, it was little close to awful, some shows have remarkable OST that keeps you immersed in the plot, but this show didn't seem to have all that interesting soundtracks that go along the theme in general,\n\r\n-Enjoyment (8.5/10)\r\nEven though all weak points of this show, I still had a hell of fun watching and following the plot and characters as they developed, Humor is what interested me the most.\n\r\n-Overall, I give this 7.7/10, I expected the show to be awful, unnecessary and uninteresting, but, watching it till the end, made me question the reason I avoided watching it a long time ago, I drove in with 0 expectations, and ended up loving it, good show to say the least.\n"

David Studio really is throwing some enormous budget on this show. There were more highly animated scenes than not, some of which rival modern movies in quality. The expressions have never been this lively, the colors look more vibrant and alive and the fire animation, in the words of lady Agness, got more firey if you will.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe voice acting was very good this season. Especially Tamaki's, Shinra, and dear God, Dr. Geovanni.\r\nThe production team nailed sound design in season one and they never showed any signs of slacking off this season too. The SFX are very fitting, intense, and highlight every moment of impact and combustion, at this point, I wish lighting up a tighter would sound as badass as fire sounds in the show.\r\nThe openings were great, especially the first one, and vice versa for the endings. Seriously, the second ending song rivals season one's first ending theme song.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nThere were undeniably more character moments this season.\r\nMore of my complaints of which regard completely turned to compliments as I 100% started watching this season with 0 expectations for seeing any improvements in what concerns character development and such.\r\nTamaki was amazing this season, her growth really highlighted her journey thus far, no more complaints about her, I mean, her random fan service moments are still just as strong but they seem to have gotten a better grab for better timing and execution.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.4/10):\r\nI would be lying if I said I did not like this season better than I did the previous one, it's an objectively better production, better storyboarded and directed, the humor seemed to have improved and the backstories really did not take from the actions and were properly placed and called for at the right moment. Unlike season one, it definitely makes you wish for a third season.\n\r\nOverall (8.06/10):\r\nThis is how a sequel should improve.\r\nEnen no Shoboutai shows a lot more potential in this one, not that it didn't in the first season, it definitely had something but it lost it somewhere mid-season, however, with this crazy comeback of a sequel, it restored and even built more on top of what it originally presented, expanding on the lore, normalizing and improving the main cast's treats and overall improving accordingly in every way.\n"

You have to admit that the show does a lot of good deeds it becomes hard to nitpick the minor flaws it has. But that doesn't make any less of an excuse for such a big budget production that has remained faithful to the fans throughout its serialization.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nThis season, in particular, was the connecting point for a lot of past foreshadowing and clues that filled the entirety of the 3 seasons, a lot of plot-changing reveals and game-shifting events wrapped. The series has changedinto a course we never expected when it first debuted, which magnificent and proper character development for the majority of the main cast.\r\nThe pacing was not at its hight, I can arguably say that season 2 had was better paced, probably due to the hyper action sequences it had.\r\nSomething I did not like was how Levi turned from an interesting character to being a lame plot device that's used whenever the show needs to justify or get away with something, but unfortunately, most people think that an overpowered character is an example of a well-written character. Which in Levi's case was relatively expanded on in the previous season, however, his power flexing spoils a lot of the plot. It could have been more creative to have a better way for the \u201cgoodies\u201d to have an arsenal up their sleeves rather than a flexing boi in a green cape.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nI'm going to say that the series has had some better days, visually speaking. It felt that this cour had probably the worse production value on a greater scale compared to the other seasons, it seems like they started running out of money, but who am I kidding, this series sales like a God's church.\r\nThe color palette remained as gloomy and medieval as ever (except for the last part of the final episode, but I think that was a great decision regarding the emotional impact of that moment, as depicting freedom as a brighter, much livelier colorful atmosphere).\r\nThe anatomy was kind of off at times, out of shape faces and overgrown heads, you see, that's what the real problem the animation department had, consistency. I guess that this show really needs years-long breaks in order to retain the same high production value, but you know we are not going to be able to hold it for another 4 years, especially that the final season is probably in the making.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nLeave it to \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d for the final flex, really, the voice acting cast know what they are doing the whole time, for a show filled with emotional hits all the time, you really need a capable talented group of people that can deliver the same feels that matches the emotion animated on their faces. And you know this season had a lot of those moments especially.\r\nThe opening theme song this time around felt like a mix of all the other 4 openings, you don't know what one to use, just smash them together, and it worked.\r\nI'm not so sure about the ending theme song, not the best in the show, but also not that bad.\r\nThe OTS is just another thing that you just have to hand it to \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d, taking down Titans takes a lot than slicing their back-necks off, it takes a strong, hype and blood-boiling soundtracks that make you imitate the boys as they go about their freedom-seeking duty.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nWatching the first episode of the franchise and some random episode from this season back to back would totally feel like an entirely different Anime, the biggest change would be how different everybody is.\r\nEren went full 180deg on us, from a screaming angry \u201cI'm going to slaughter all the titans\u201d boy to a more mature and quite strategy enforcer that understands the bigger picture and realizes a greater goal than just ripping apart giants' neck.\r\nErmin received quite the recognition that's totally deserved regarding everything he did for humanity as they know it, gained a lot of courage and experience and is no longer the shy oppressed slim boy he used to be. Basically, everybody else has had a noticeable development so far, and I would say that except for Mikasa if anything, she's still as dead in the eyes and as concerned the whole time as ever. Levi is just the same thing, I guess there must be something with this Ackerman clan.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nNot the best season of \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d in my opening, there was a lot of praise and hype that I totally bought, but it ended up extremely disappointing, especially for the \u201ccontroversially-top-rated\u201d episode that caused a lot of buzz-talk for a couple of weeks, I literally found that the episode after that was ways better, buy into hype was a lesson I had to learn sooner or later, but even so, it was not enough to ruin a great show.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nIf you've already watched 2 seasons and a split cour for this show, then there is really no excuse to not watch this second cour too, for how good of an investment you already made, grab a drink, watch some recaps, and just dive in, it really was a different kind of mix between the good ol' action-packed \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d and the massively political spirited part 1 of the 3rd season.\n"

I sort of liked the bold lines on the art, making it closer to a comic than the movie which is always a welcomed change of pace.\n\r\nI always liked the dynamic between the Endeavor and Hawks duo, both are monsters in theirown right, but not equally as monstrous on the public eye.\n"

            "content": "\n                When something hits, it hits hard. That was my take on Gaikotsu Honda-san. When you first look at it, there is the cover art, then the synopsis, and the genre, three of the arbitrary deciding factors that might give you a primary opinion on a said show, and for me, it was one boney boy and no idea on the plot whatsoever, and probably that's what appealing about the Slice of Life genre, you know it's following someone's daily life, you know it's going to be either hilariously on point or sadly relatable, probably both.\r\nAfter watching Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san, I might just add an exceptionto that factor.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nWhen it comes to its fundamental core, it's just another Slice of Life show, the kind of shows that are worth the watch after a long tire-y day of work, and probably that's what justifies its relatively short episodes (about 10 minutes each). Not only does it blend well with the relaxation after a hard day scenario, but the show itself also dives into the idea of hard working and doing the best in your job, for your job.\r\nThe setup is pretty simple and familiar, one busy bookstore, specialized in selling Manga and Light novels, I guess similar merchandise as well?\r\nHonda-san is one skull-faced ambitious clerk that strives to genuinely provide the most ideal customer service with the help of his equally enthusiastic co-workers. No literally, the part about the skull face couldn't be more literal. Filled with other famous Manga and Anime references and with a tremendous amount of fourth-wall breaking jokes, it really made for the perfect parody of the Otaku community, something that think is semi-important to get most of the jokes.\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nNot too shabby, and not with the rest of average works either.\r\nAs serious as the show is, the animation, in my opinion, couldn't be any more complimentary. There is something about it, very clean and abstract that makes it stand out for the other shows, it really does have that special charm of its own that makes it distinguishable in a great way.\r\nAnd don't mix it up, when I talk animation, I talk art style, because you know, for a series that doesn't rely on action and fast-paced scenes, smooth animation wouldn't do it any favor.\r\nThe character designs are truly remarkable, for instance, the main cast is put in such a noticeable perspective you'd almost see a spotlight on top of them all the time. Obviously, the show makes references to the real world, it presents the character as normal everyday life people; with no superpowers or out of the world capabilities but a blessing that gives you a genuine smile, which is more of a naturable rare ability,n especially in this day and age.\r\nA skeleton as a clerk and his gang of weirdly masked people, at first they give you the impression of goofiness, but they, those are the manifestation of their personalities, also that outlining look only helps to highlight them from the rest of the crowd on the screen. Most of the shows could settle by giving the main character an explicit hairstyle or a special hair color, but Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san goes all out and parodies even those who fall short on delivery.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nA big part of this was the voice acting, and you know, in a comedy show, a special kind of voice acting is needed, something that's really hard to nail.\r\nI wouldn't have recommended a better mashup of good voice actors that can blend this well in a show of this production value.\r\nI feel as though I should talk in a more general way when it comes to this part, but I can't help but direct all my focus on Honda-san (Saitou Souma).\r\nHe's presented with such tone of voice that alone screams of comedy, all of the nervous cuts and Engrish overdosing was worth it on the run.\r\nI can't really speak much of the opening and ending theme songs, I know I enjoyed the opening theme song to some degree, however, I never got the single from the latter. As for the soundtracks, I don't think I've been able to notice them all that much, probably because of how involving the content was to me, you just keep on focusing on the context you almost get drawn onto to screen and blend with the rest of the characters for how painfully relatable it was.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI've been eager to talk about the characters ever since the first episode.\r\nI've said a lot in the \u201cArt\u201d section already, but I feel that was only what concerned the character design. And now, let's hit their terminology.\r\nHonda-san, an individual that's been presented to us as the typical bookstore clerk we all know, the dead in the face stereotype that really seems all that boring on the surface, probably that's what they were aiming for with his skeletal design. But once we get put in the clerks' perspective, we get to see more on how \u201cthey\u201d view the business, what goes in their minds when they are serving a customer, are they genuinely doing it for the good, or just as a means of survival?\r\nIt turns out some people are just born that nice, but can't express it correctly, probably that's what stops a lot of relationships. You never have to judge people by appearances, one thug looking fella might become your closest friend open the expense of a \u201cGood morning\u201d, you might never know. And that doesn't concern only Honda-san, it seems all of his co-workers relate to the same treats one way or another, they all have to deal with different costumes every day, and we know, people come in all different types.\r\n\u201csticks and stones may break my bones but a difficult costumer might draw me into depression, and a cheerful might even cure my cancer\u201d, that's what it was like for the cast all along.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nAnd even beyond. 8 out of 10 sounds like a disappointment for a show of this status, I forgot how long was it since I last enjoyed a comedy slice of life before deciding it's one shallow try-hard series. For me, Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san was a bit too fast-paced, you have characters talking way too fast I found myself replaying some bits more occasionally so that I could get the meaning behind the references they were making, one could say it's part of the experience, however, I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't had to tone down to that. I'm willing to give it another rewatch and pick up on the jokes I've missed out on, and would even consider rewatching it dubbed if we ever got a decent one soon.\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10):\r\nEverything must come to an end, at least, I can say I've watched a great series from the bottom of my heart, as much as unbiased I tried to make this review, I was hesitant to submit to this somewhat low score for such a charming series, I know for a fact this is going on the top of my list of comedy slice if life recommendations. Not only that but as strong as it stands out as a rewatch heavy material, this should become more familiar as I'm willing to rewatch the heck out of it with friends and family, all of the BL jokes can never get old.\r\nI do think however that most of the enjoyment comes at the expense of being familiar with the Otaku community, or else, most of the jokes would only get passed the typical viewer without a sent.\n"

            "content": "\n                This is such a baffling franchise.\r\nNot even a month ago, I was an outsider, I followed the common toxic hive mind of the weeb culture, if it's SAO, you must hate it.\r\nTurned out, all washed up words for the sake of hate, I enjoyed the first season, and found the second decent as well, but then, I stumbled across this one, the alternative story that the fans praise to death, \u201cThis is better than the real thing\u201d they always say, guess what; Not \ud83d\udc4f Even \ud83d\udc4f Close \ud83d\udc4f.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nWith SAO II, we got to explore the game GGO, as we've been fed, it's adusty wasteland, filled with dark plot points, but with this side story, we get to see the actual fun part of the game, the competitive side that does not give in to the clich\u00e9 SAO trope, a literal game of death where the stakes are high until it was not. \n\r\nKaren, a 20 years old introvert with a giant complex, having been always the tallest among her peers, she sought an escape from VR games, she would try several of them until she played GGO because of how tiny and cure her avatar looked. Simple and straight forward to kick in a plot so far.\n\r\nMost of the fun comes from the fact of how competitive GGO under the hood really is, watching it feels like diving into an intense Battle Royal stream by professional, but I have to say, it felt so forced to have the players stress out over a certain somebody's death it had me mumble \u201cOh yeah, this is SAO, it's been SAO and it's going to remain as SAO as SAO was itself\u201d. Running after this fake goal of mind ruined a big portion of entertainment, having me literally say \u201cIt's just a game bro\u201d. The story was very brief that seeing the first 5 episode was enough to get the complete experience, I had already seen all that GGO could offer, and I would argue that it was the better half too.\n\r\nPeople would make a big deal on how plot-armor reliant SAO was while on the same breath praise the living hell out of how this one was superior in every way. This show literally has a talking, conscious plot armor shoved in on your face more than one occasion. People always miss the hit on the protagonist, and what's the universal excuse? \u201cAh, she's so tiny\u201d, ok, I'll buy that, not a problem, but for the 100th time in a row? And then they call it luck. And it does not stop there, I guess, missing from less than 10 meters would be a stupid logic, so what do we do in that case? Ah, let's have the P-50 talk and invoke its own will to alter the outcome of the battle.\r\nI'm so done.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nIt's very weird with this show, I guess I'll have to blame that on the setting. It's very weird to see the character in real life act all moe and stuff while looking moe as hell, only or a few moments later, they are battlefield gorillas covered in dust and scary expressions all over their faces, it was not coherent at all.\r\nThe huge absence of close combat action (except for like 2 times) took a huge burden on the animators it seems, the scene is moved more by dialog and tactic monologues than it does by sheer movement and motion. Everyone lines up shoot several rounds of fire and then takes cover, all while looking fabulous.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nDefinitely, the weakest in the franchise when it comes to the vocals. None of the voice actors struck me surprised or anything, Pito's laugh was annoying and unbearable to listen too, a bit unnecessarily over the top. And everybody else was just average.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were alright, nothing that keeps you going back, but they were just kind of there.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nSurprisingly enough, a doll plot is driven by some interesting people.\r\nKaren was a good lead for this story, Fuka was a great support character and M was just the best, this dude even gives the cast from the main plot a run for their money, that dude should make more cameos in the parent show.\r\nPito, however, was just off-putting. Annoying laugh, no so good voice acting, and contradicting personality, I think that they were trying to push her as a quirky sadist, they managed to promote the sadistic part, but fail everything else. I wouldn't say she's a villain per se, I mean, =It's just a game bruh, but man, she does not get that line.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nThis would have been a notch higher if it stopped at episode 5, by then, I had already seen what the show can offer, but it kept on repeating the same thing over and over again.\r\nI gotta give it to the show though, the fact that the stakes weren't as high really made me root for everyone, not just the protagonist, I would be cheering some random background filler squad all the time.\n\r\n- Overall(6.8/10):\r\nOne thing keeping this show ahead of the original is the fact that it's a standalone show that one can enjoy without having seen the parent shows, it shares the same world, following the events of the Phantom Bullet arc from SAO II but man, everything else it does itself. It's always nice to see references from the parent show but not noticing them cuts nothing from the overall experience. Although referencing the dullest nitpick is more satisfying than anything about the show. Watch with caution.\n"

On the other side of the coin, there is Yamashita Kazou, an old Japanese salaryman, so fed up with his life, the non-ending bills and debt is catching up to his last nerves, with no way out, he gets involved in this gruesome underworld fighting scene with a promise for a better and more stable life.\n\r\nWhat really put Kengan Ashura above Baki narratively was the plot itself, there is a lot of politics to what seems like just a sublime fist fight. Global corporations are at stake and influence is constantly shaping up to be the decider of fates here. It throws itself under a curve ball but comes off as a full-powered continental crossing canon shot, full of promise and rights to come.\n\r\nLooking at this first season alone, not much can be praised, but it's one of that stories that lays itself a strong foundation and builds upon it in time. So many intriguing characters make their debut and a lot of rivalries are set up from the get-go.\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10.\n"

The motion graphic spin-off series provides a comedic interpretation of the events that took place in conjunction with the anime. Originally released on the official Twitter page of the series, the Picture Dramas were included in the Blu-ray BOX sets. The voice cast for the Picture Dramas is the same as the Anime cast, which is definitely a plus for fans of the series.\n\r\nDespite the Picture Drama's comedic nature, it does give us some insight into the characters that we don'tget to see in the main show. For example, we learn that Hajime chose Yue over all the other girls, which some viewers may find disappointing. Additionally, the Picture Drama highlights the dangers of girls' night chatter and shows us that a mother's love knows no bounds.\n\r\nHowever, some of the Picture Drama episodes do come across as strange and disjointed. For instance, Shea's interactions with the child leave the audience feeling uneasy, and some viewers may feel that Eri is even more annoying in the Picture Drama. Furthermore, some of the episodes feel like they're trying too hard to be funny, such as the One Piece and Overlord specials.\n\r\nThe Picture Drama does have its positives, including the fact that the animation is well done, and the opening and ending songs are still enjoyable to listen to. However, it's clear that less effort went into these episodes than the main show, as evidenced by the floating heads used in one episode instead of full character animations. Some viewers may also be confused by certain scenes, such as when Hajime considers a blob of slime over an alternative.\n\r\nOverall, the Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou 2nd Season Picture Drama is a mixed bag. While it's a fun and lighthearted way to enjoy the series, some viewers may find it disjointed and too focused on humor. The Picture Drama is definitely not a substitute for the main show, and some viewers may feel that the budget for these episodes could have been better spent on improving the main series.\n"

            "content": "\n                The sequel we've been spared the wait for.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nUnlike the earlier installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 focused more on an aspect you never expect a show like this to address, more than fights and massacres, it was heavy on politics, but why would you complain? We at least got to know way more about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin than any other seasons, and thanks to this, a lot of our questions were answered, and the more episode you watched, the closer to the truth you get \u201cGotta tell this to my buddy, Erwin\u201d. Not to say fights were absent, oh no,there is a massacre on a huge scale, but the sheer exposure of world building and new information made those look very minimalistic.\r\nA lot of things finally made sense, earlier we had something like an uncut follow of past events that we needed juxtaposition for so bad in order to tie some sense to them, that's what this season was mostly about. The pacing felt a little bit slow, mainly because of the dialogue-heavy nature of the season.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nWe've gotten to the point where it's not at the least a surprise to expect high-quality animation, some fans will even use the franchise's title as a synonym for \u201cfantastic animation\u201d.\r\nWithout having to stretch this any longer, you know you're getting your doses of blood, the gloomy color pallets only make the medieval atmosphere feel more dense and alive. However, the only complaint I have, and only had about Shingeki no Kyojin is the lack of variety for unique character face design, if you really took the time, you can spot a disturbing similarity in their general facial structure; short rephrased, they look alike.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nAs good as the animation, the soundtrack is as great. This season introduced a bit of a controversial opening theme song, which a lot of people thought it was an insult to the previous ones. I for one think it's a solid song with or without the Anime, it's great, it's packed with emotion, contracts the portrayed story arc very well, I get it's not your typical loud and hype Shingeki no Kyojin opening, but it remains better than some in respect of quality.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nOut of all the other installments, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 was packed with character development, especially for Historia, you can even call it her season.\r\nWe've got teased about her on the earlier seasons, especially season 2, and here we got to peek under the blanket and see what was up there, and oh boy was it shocking. Eren as well got to know some truth about his lost memories, and thus had his level up to some degree in terms of character building.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nEntertainment comes in many forms, the earlier season gave us the hype with the cinematic dynamic camera freestyling over the fantastic battles, and this one had us watch out jows from hitting the ground from sheer wowing for what we get to know about the world of Shingeki no Kyojin. Enjoying your favorite characters' moments.\r\nThe midpoint of the show was a little bit meh compared to the beginning and the ending points though.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nWe've been promised of getting a full 24 episodes action-packed third season, but at some point they decided to split it in half and have the first 12 episodes focus on the political stuff, and the other half reintroduce us to raw action in \u201cprobably\u201d the most hyped season yet, but unfortunately that got delayed for some time now.\r\nFor me, season two is still the top of hype for the franchise, until we get some more shocking revelation and hyped fights that would remain as such. However, not to say that this season falls down in terms of quality of anything, we've just been spoiled way too much, having us wait 4 years for a sequel at the time had us hungry for more content, it made the good better and the bad good.\n"

            "content": "\n                Having seen the marvel that was Dororo, the 2019 adaptation, and following the story that, in fact, in some way, helped market the new recut as the return of a 50 years old show had me dive in curiosity. What initiated the first thought of producing such a comeback? Was it an industry-leading figure at the time? Did it remarkably impact the industry that it deserved such a revival? Or did a rich anonymous weeb decide to suddenly fund the recut? Whatever the reason, curiosity was eating my thoughts like raging maggots. I need answeres, and watching the original TV show was the way togo about it. But wait, there is an introductory pilot episode that I had to take care of, enter \u201cDororo Pilot\u201d.\n\r\nFrom what I had gathered, the series serves as a deliberate recap for what to come next in the main series. One interesting observation was how it featured colors!! Yeah, very interesting from a super old animation, and I don't have the historical context to link its serialization period with the request technology that outputs such a colored sequence.\r\nThe art style emphasizes the show's old age like wrinkles on a world war survivor's face. Aside from the average, outdated visuals, the vocals, specifically, the OST was just spot on, putting modern-day adaptations to shame. It was riding along the atmosphere of the show, matching the rhythm of the story more than the narrative itself, really putting you into the spirit of watching more.\n"

I don't hate the show, but I also don't put in any effort trying to fan up and follow every news and announcement related to it. Despite the giant fuss people made over the first season, I never felt any sort of resonance from the show, except for maybe the last 5 minutes from episode 19. But you, you already heard too much about that episode alone.\n\r\nWhen this movie was announced, I did not have any expectations nor did I bother formulatingone. It was going to be just another Demon Slayer hill roll, or so I thought, so I put it back until an unnamed day.\n\r\nFast forward a long while later, and after refusing to watch it at a cinema with friends, I finally was forced to check it out out of boredom, and oh boy, did that hurt.\n\r\nThe train arc adapted by this movie was the most definitive Demon Slayer experience that I always feel left out of, perhaps it's not the arc perse, but the movie formula that really complimented its run. Trimming all unnecessary screening and compacting the important tidbits, it's what really pinned me down in my place, almost cramping my leg on multiple occasions of how much intensity carried throughout the movie.\n\r\nPicking up right after the first season left, almost like the start of a Modern Warfare campaign, straight to the action, no time wasted in too much recapping. It felt like a microcosm of the entire season one, get into a location, gets to know the key characters, struggles against an enemy, have a character growth moment, and leave off on a high note. Amazing.\n\r\nMy favorite aspect about this entire movie, and what contributed the most to my enjoyment is the character highlight of Rengoku. The first season ended on a really breathy moment, right after introducing us to the massive cast of new characters known as Hashirah, this movie went from knowing nothing about any of them to the point of not caring, to genuinely rooting for Rengoku, even more so than Tanjiro or anybody else in the show.\n\r\nRengoku, this larger-than-life character, felt like an over-exaggerated, more accomplished version of Tanjiro, both ideologically and physically, with a great backstory and strong motive to do what he does.\n\r\nIf you thought the 2 minutes of good animation at the end of episode 19 was masterful, get a load of this 2 hours long version of the same thing. Everything from line art that breaks into the characters' emotions to the beyond the fluid\r\nmovement of every muscle wrap or strand of cloth. The elemental effects from the show are present here, only much more perfected and better cinematographer.\n\r\nThe music too was something that really had me wish I experienced the movie on a cinema, alone, blessed by every decibel of that orchestral greatness. The OST really carried a lot of emotional weight that's at the same time, presented in an unbelievably euphorical voice acting line up.\n\r\nThis is a movie you wish you saw over and over again, one of those picks that you'd show a non Anime watching person in hopes of introducing them to Anime in general, it was that good.\n"

But at least, you have got to appreciate the physics that only seem to get funky the closer you get to one's chest, oddly enough, works only on female characters.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nNothing that makes you go \u201cWow\u201d, I love the outro, the same one from the parent story, however, the second opening theme song hadn't aged quite healthy in my memory.\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\r\nI would have given this a 4/10, but you gotta have some extra points for the minimalistic screen time for the great Azazel.\r\nAll the characters didn't have anything to add to this episode, aside from getting violated.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nNot the best highschool DxD OVA out there, probably because of the focus on underwear? and like Issei said, it's about what's under the underwear, not specifically them, they are nothing but a support for the magnificent support they provide for.\n\r\n- Overall (6.2/10):\r\nI had higher expectations for this OVA, but while not being too terrible, I managed to get some giggles with sometimes spacing out because nothing too interesting was happening. I would recommend watching this, because it's more like a 13th episode for the second season, if you're in for the fanservice, then you're differently going to love this, but if you're like me, a man of culture but also has interest in the plot, you could skip this as it has no ties to the main plot, but skipping an episode might end up in you having some regrets, because one day, you'll finish seeing all of the episodes, and probably want more, but there are no episodes left, so take this chance if you're comfortable, and have fun.\n"

Oh, how we waited, and boy, did we wait. But it seems that this dish had been cooking for way too long and ended up a little overcooked, if you catch my drift.\n\r\nSo, what's the deal with this sequel, you ask? Well, Masamune is still hell-bent on making Aki fall for him, only to dump her like yesterday's leftovers. But wait,there's a twist! They're off to the City of Love, Paris, for a class trip. Perfect, right? Wrong. Instead of the sweet aroma of romance, we get a whiff of desperation as Masamune teams up with a French high school otaku, Muriel Besson, who wants him to be the model for her manga. Romance is in the air, folks, and it smells like... anime clich\u00e9s.\n\r\nBut hold on, we're not done yet! Kanetsugu Gasou enters the scene, masquerading as Masamune to mess with Aki's head. It's like a recipe for romantic chaos, and by this point, we're wondering if they've run out of ideas or if they're just stirring the pot for the sake of it.\n\r\nLet's be real here; \"Masamune-kun no Revenge R\" is like that dish you spent hours preparing, only to realize it lacks seasoning and flavor. It's the living proof that stale romance slice-of-life has no place in the modern anime scene unless it comes up with something new. Unfortunately, this sequel feels like reheated leftovers, and the taste is getting old.\n\r\nThe disappointment is real, my friends. We waited so long for this second season, and what did we get? A half-baked attempt at recapturing the magic of the first season, and it falls flat. The characters we once rooted for seem to have lost their charm, and the plot feels like it's going through the motions.\n\r\nWhatever this third-grade writing assignment is should have stayed in the drafts. It's a reminder that not all sequels live up to the hype, and sometimes, it's better to savor the memory of the original than to force-feed yourself a disappointing follow-up. If you're in the mood for a romantic comedy, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.\n\r\nOveral: 5.56/10.\n"

Something about this old, crusty animation felt more alive and appealing than the TV series, it was clunky but responsive, amateur but full of life, and it definitely had a distinct flair for the action.\n\r\nGiven the short airtime, I couldn't be harsher on the mediocrity of the storytelling, it was a queue of fights against some fighters that we see in the main series, one thing I should mentionthough is how better and more ominous Shinogi looks here, scarier and intimidating that on the main series. And without forgetting this version of Baki, it's honestly my favorite looking version of him.\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10,\n"

            "content": "\n                As a celebration for the 10th year of Naruto's serialization, the OVA under the title of \u201cNaruto: The Cross Roads\u201d was released on the 12th October 2009 that offers something different as far as the Naruto releases go.\r\nThis time around, with a flashback centered story all in a style that settles between the classic 2D and 3D animations, and it actually doesn't feel as bad as it sounds, but it was never about animation alone, unless you're just like the brats dropping their jaws whenever they spot colors, that's the power of visual, and it's easily deceiving.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nBefore diving in into the story dissection,I'd really like to warn you on the spoiler heaviness you'll encounter, so,in case you've already passed the first 300 episodes of Naruto Shippuden, this would be as normal as a review gets, major spoilers ahead, if you'd like to avoid them, please skip the story analysis and move on to later parts.\r\nThe premise of the story is one short flashback of Sasuke's from the point of the story where he was a member of the Akatsuki, one that goes back in time to the much simpler times when he was still part of team 7, somewhere after the events of the Hidden mist arc and before the Chunnin exams.\r\nA lame classic plot point had Sasuke of course taken hostage by the baddies in order for Sasuke and Naruto to save her whilst Kakashi is absent. It was all fast-paced action that Orochimaru orchestrated in order to \u201ctest Sasuke and tease later events like him switching sides.\r\nIt really felt like a painful excuse to milk an OVA out of all the build-up that lead to him joining the Akatsuki, with few references to Itachi and the Uchiha clan.\n\r\n- Art (7.0/10):\r\nCGI, and before you face the other side and start running away, it actually looked decent, not the best, One Piece Mugiwara Chase 3D had me pin it as one if not the best 3D adaptation for an already long-running serialization and Naruto tried holding on to the safe zone and was almost there.\r\nIt all looked more like a game cutscene rather than a normal animated episode, keeping it as close to 2D as possible differently helped lower the strangeness of it a bit. The water mechanics were cool, the smoke animation as well. However the fights despite being a lot more fluid and organic they still felt like a stranger and took away a lot of what made Naruto fights look cool.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nI really appreciate the nostalgic soundtracks and sound effects.\r\nThe voice acting was above average, nothing too jaw-dropping. A lot of room for improvement is different there, it seems so cheap for a milestone anniversary to be honest.\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\r\nDisappointed, Sasuke couldn't be less out of character here, you'd figure they would give her a moment of shine in such an important OVA like this one, she still played the bait role after all and contributed in nothing good.\r\nThe focused bad guys had terrible character designs and even worse ideology, they looked way too weak for the struggles they put team 7 at. Generally, very forgettable and interesting to say the least.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nThe main spotlight here was enjoying the hand to hand combat with minimal ninjutsu (remember when it was all about that?).\r\nProbably the coolest thing was the references to future arcs, even the ones in Shippuden. Such a waste, it had literally no re-watch value whatsoever.\n\r\n- Overall (6.4/10):\r\nI would strongly suggest avoiding this until you've watched through the first 300 episodes of Naruto Shippuden. Despite it being set on the timeline of the original series, it does deal with topics from future arcs, even going as far as showing massive spoiler clips from mid-Shippuden.\n"

It feels like redemption, it cries of regret, but most importantly, it relates to most of us, and we all haveour own struggle.\r\nThe voice chords feel to me like something very interesting the like of which you don't see very often taken advantage of in Anime, most of the time it's all energetic with a great sense of pop, basically the same thing over and over again, but this one makes you feel like wearing brand new socks. They are not the most exciting things in the world, but got does it feel good strap your legs into a fresh pair of socks. But maybe I'm just getting old.\r\nAs generic as the song is, the abstract black and white sketch-like drawings help with that a lot, as if you're presented with the foundation (the sketch) and tasked to flesh out your own story surrounding the nameless protagonist at the center, going through several struggles as his body adjusts in different poses almost every frame trying to put off the flaming mess that's covering him. And so he does at the end, it sure took time and many attempts, but he finally did it as you could feel the relief in his eyes as he rests them at the very end.\n"

The episode showed us once again how badass Zoro is, as he sliced through King's fire attacks and even managed to cut his mask off, almost revealing his face for the first time. We also got to see some flashbacks of Zoro's bond with his swords. The episode was narrated by Sanji and Chopper, the latter was the only one who didn't get drawn in a cute chibi style like the rest of the narrators. Maybe it's becausehe's already too adorable, or maybe it's because he's a doctor and needs to be serious. Either way, he did a great job of explaining the details of the fight and hyping us up for the next episode. The episode ended with a cliffhanger, as Zoro prepared to unleash his ultimate attack on King, who was still determined to stop him. Next week, we will finally see the conclusion of this epic battle, and I can't wait to witness Zoro's victory. I'm ready to feast on his glory. This episode was a great reminder of why Zoro is one of the best characters in One Piece, and why we love him so much. I hope it's adapted at least as half-good as last week's episode. We Wanji fans feasted like kings.\n"

We deserved better than this.\r\nI feel like, more Geneva conventions were violated in the making of this sequel than the whole time the conventions were put in place, after the fantastic first season, this should not have the right to exist.\n\r\nThere is so much wrong with this half baked adaptation, as an Anime only, I was fine in the first three episodes, but trust me when I say, my rating wentfrom a high 8 to a low 4 with a single line of dialogue, after many attempts at balancing my rating, I concluded 6/10 is fair enough of this unfair adaptation, and here's why.\n\r\nThe lore dump we get exposed to at the very beginning was very much needed, it created such a high ceiling that the series needed to exceed, it seems it shot for too much. The sudden return of a certain character, along with frequent, nonchalant, unnoticed jumps in times, the series was beyond saving, and even then it kept going lower with no intention to slow down. The slap on the camel's back was with the final episode's slideshow, you could have believed for a moment that maybe, a third season might be able to pull off something miraculous and save face, but no; Powerpoint\u2122 slideshows left and right, not only ruining any chance of repair but also spoiling anyone who was intended to read the Manga afterward. What a tastless, out-of-season April joke.\n\r\nCredit where credit is due I guess, the Animation was great, shockingly great in fact, the outer world felt so magical and with the right amount of screen spacing and color displacement, it really came out to reality. The sound design was incredible as well, phenomenal voice acting, as usual, it's just a shame that went it mattered the most, the best thing about the franchise, which was writing, wasn't really there.\n\r\nOverall: 6.8/10\n"

But come on, we don't need a recap for every single event that has happened in the series. It's like they're trying to fill time or avoid actually producing new content. Maybe they should consider taking a week off or investing those precious production hours into something more worthwhile. Just a thought.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the bizarre choice of having Robin narrate a recap. I mean, I love Robin as much as the next One Piece fan, but it felt completely out of place.

Reflections, as in reflecting on something, and please note that the \u201cs\u201d is for pluralization. I'm going to be as straightforward as that title or else this might turn into a grammar lesson. This 55 minutes long OVA goes through various characters (Edward, Scare, Roy...), each thinking back on what happened, bringing back all of those big impacting moments of the show, and let's be clear here, it's all contained in the events of the original Anime adaptation, \u201cFullmetal Alchemist\u201d (not the Brotherhood remake). Sounds as generic as any recap right? But wayhigher in quality than most of those. And this is why.\r\nFor once, storytelling was changed massively, but still had the vanilla feel of Fullmetal Alchemist despite there being rushy jump-in-between several plot points all the way through. We got to see all of the stories again from the eyes of various conflicted characters.\r\nAnimation wise, this had me drop my jaw in favor of giving appreciation for the fantastic dedication that was put into this project, the image quality was still bad, but the content had a special care to it. And to think that Fullmetal Alchemist had this kind of quality going on even in the old-school days is just mind-blowing (I've watched both adaptations, and it seems that the updated version had fooled me long enough).\r\nI've been waiting to address this, the musical scores were spectacular. Phenomenally and smoothly blend into the scenarios and with such a perfect transition that you couldn't' notice them kicking off. I was never a huge fan of the subbed of Fullmetal Alchemist, but this can be either a hit or miss for some people. Switching focus on different characters and their perspectives was truly genius, it made me relive the days when I used to theorize my crazy speculations on the show. The lore was very overwhelming and crazily draws you in to even go as far as rewatching the Anime adaptation all over again. I would most differently recommend this for the fans that want to have a quick refreshing recap, it's both informative and fun to watch. I wouldn't recommend watching this over the Anime adaptation as it still skips through so much stuff, and only serves as a nostalgic reminder for the fans of the series.\n"

I was just lurking around the comment section praising some Anime I was watching (Probably Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari) when someone recommended to me an upcoming (at the time) series by the name Arifureta, as he/she/she called it. An immersive take on the Isekai genre that will leave me disgusted at Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari for not scaling up to the latter's amazing and original storytelling. I can't even take myself seriously while I force these words down my keyboard. I apologize. However, noteven apologizing saves this miserable, godforsaken show from being criticized, in fact, praising it is shall grant you recognition and label you like the trash you are along with you weird taste in Anime, but then again, all Anime is trash, and so are all of us. Anime was a mistake, ASO is the best show to bless us on this earth, and that goes without saying.\n\r\nStory (3/10):\r\n\tSigh, straight up, the biggest disappointment of this year's Anime for me, probably because I loved the potential it had, I wanted to like this Anime, I really did, but it crippled me so hard I began to question my very first thought of wanting to watch the show. That first brain cell who initiated all of this, why do you hate me so much? Or should I say DID because you're already long dead and what a pitiful death serving me this trash?\r\n\tYour typical Isekai might settle with an edgy/nerdy (mostly) male character into a magical world full of waifu pairing combinations, BUT, this chad of a show throws in the entire class and their teacher in our typical Isekai might settle with an edgy/nerdy (mostly) male character into a magical world full of waifu pairing. Hajime is your typical nerdy shy underdog, no very attractive nor any stronger than an ant probably that suddenly pulls up a major Kaneki on us without any warning, and then it goes downhill into a cursed realm of pervy dragon humanoid that likes sticking rods her alone. A playboy inspired rabbit girl and a lewd loli vampire that takes dangerous kisses from the main character occasionally. If this did not scare you enough you probably are a bold one for sure.\r\n\tMost of the plot is build on Hajime's confrontation with his old teammate from whom he seemed to have cut ties to them giving him an underdog's gaze, his power that surpassed all of them combined carries all the hype, and it really is very predictable that not only it is an Isekai that embraces all the clich\u00e9 tropes they usually come with, but its name is literally translated to \u201cArifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest\u201d, making this dude a perfect mix between Rimuru (Tensei Shitara Datta Ken) and Naofumi (Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari). But not even that raised the story on the tracks.\r\n\tThe pacing is very wacky, all over the place, the timeline is kind of confusing and the wide selection of key characters (The entire class and the teacher along with some head commanders that represent the world they are in) makes it very hard to fit all of them in the limited time frame of the show.\n\r\nArt (2/10):\r\n\tYikes, where do I even start shitting on this. Is it the worst visually produced Anime I watched? I'm not too sure (I do have a horrible record when it comes to that) but this could probably take the crown for it, it is utterly unacceptable for a show on 2019 to look this bad, I mean what even are your excuses, Even I used to make foldable animations when I was in elementary school that had more frames than an entire 5 minutes of every episode. The anatomy was off, the colors felt very artificial and blant and the CGI, OMG don't even get me started on that one, and I though Fairy Gone had the worst CGI of 2019 in the bag, this is just another level of trash, unbearable that I stopped caring somewhere in the first episode.\n\r\nSound (4/10):\r\n\tThe opening and ending theme songs are probably the only good things I can get behind when it comes to the vocals. The voice acting was average at best, it's probably was more due to the pointless dialogue, but the execution did not make it any better. The soundtracks were so forgettable that I never paid attention to any of them if they even were there, to begin with.\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\r\n\tI've honestly seen more interesting wooden planks in the construction site besides my house. Other than Hajime and Yue, nobody is worthy of remembering, not that those two are, and for all the wrong reasons. Hajime felt more like a China rip-off of Kaneki done wrong anyway, he was an empty shell of a character, probably on some extreme emo-edge lord pills ever since a certain incident, and Yue is the typical loli heroin that falls under the dangerous jail-bait category. Yes, kisses were fired, and passionately while at that.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\n\tDespite its many flaws, no, despite being flawed in every way, it stood for a time-killing guilty pleasure, I'm definitely not proud by picking it up and the fact that the second season was already confirmed makes me even more depressed that I will have to sit through another 12 episodes of the same trash unless it was good this time around, one can only hope.\r\n\tI really liked the music (opening and ending theme songs), I liked my fair share of clich\u00e9 and loaned for the crappy old build-ups it attempted to cramp in its serialization, it was the show I can just sit and watch whenever without having to worry about devoting a single brain cell in the process.\n\r\nOverall (3.7/10):\r\n\tJust stay away before you're done dirty the way I was. If I could rewind time I would certainly refrain from falling for the hype this show had around following it when it was first announced. However, I'm sure that even I can't say if it's the worst Isekai out there, so if you know your way around your Isekai, then sure. You've been warned.\n"

After a decade-long hiatus, the series made its triumphant return, and it did so in a way that was both faithful to the original series and fresh and exciting.\n\r\nOne of the things that really stood out to me about \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" was the way that it captured the spirit of the original series while also modernizing and updating it for a new generation of viewers. The show was able to strike a perfect balance between nostalgia and innovation, andthis made it feel like a true continuation of the original series rather than a cheap imitation.\n\r\nThe animation and art style of \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" were also a major highlight. The show was able to take advantage of the latest advances in animation technology to deliver some of the most visually impressive action scenes in the series' history. The character designs were also faithful to the original art style, and this helped to make the show feel like a true continuation of the original series.\n\r\nBut perhaps the most impressive aspect of \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" was its storytelling. The show tackled the 1000 years' blood war arc, and it did so in a way that was both satisfying and exciting. The plot was full of twists and turns, and it did a great job of resolving long-standing plot threads and answering many of the unanswered questions from the original series.\n\r\nI also want to point out that \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" did not censor anything, with the exception of a few very minor and unimportant comedic moments. This is a refreshing change from many modern anime, which often feel sanitized and watered down due to heavy censorship. \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" was unapologetically itself, and this helped to make it feel more authentic and genuine.\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" to fans of the series and to anyone who is looking for a thrilling and action-packed anime series. It's a true peak of shounen anime and a testament to the enduring power and appeal of the \"Bleach\" franchise. If you're a fan of \"Bleach\" or just looking for a great shounen series, then \"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen\" is definitely worth checking out.\n\r\n8.4/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Within the board of storytelling shine two specific genres that have a special wholesome charm to them. Those would be childhood adventures and summer stories, but what happens when you mix the two together? You get \u201cHotarubi no Mori e\u201d, beautifully cohesive and concise dynamic events that one leads to the other, making it translate to the same place across various time periods spanning three seasons until it lands on the sweat, sweat summer. That's when most of the story happens.\n\r\n- Story (8.8/10):\r\nTakegawa Hotaru, a young adult in her way to visit her uncle in the countrysides recalls her most cherished memories while she makesit through an apparently lengthy voyage. It all started when she was 6 years old, a tiny little clumsy girl with all the cuteness you can imagine packed in a tiny body is lost in the forest of God, crying for help. A forest that's known to be home for spirits that are rumored to arrange annual summer festivals. While crying alone near some bushes, she spots an observing masked human-looking figure that she knew later was a spirit. At the end of the day, she found her way out of the forest thanks to the mysteriously masked spirit whom she becomes friends with. However, only if she could avoid making skin contact with him, because apparently if you would touch a spirit, they would cease to exist. Hotaru spent her summer with the masted spirit, and both made a sacred promise to meet up at the same spot every other summer. But time flies like a jet, and Hotaru got older and older as the age gap between her and the masked spirit became questionable (spirits age at a much slower pace), and without spoiling anything else, it was the case of Benjamin Button all over again. What really sets the mood was the perfect pacing, not rushed and not too fast either. They managed to cover up many stages of Hotaru's growth, you would complain about other shows from the sudden excessive flashbacks, but having this whole story wrapped up in one made it one of the best flashback tales ever.\n\r\n- Art (8.9/10):\r\nWithout a bound, the budget for a movie far surpasses that of a normal show (for the most part). And Hotarubi no Mori e reminded us of that fact. All I can say about this is, it was a weird well-balanced alternation between your generic Anime art style and the other more enhanced counterpart, for instance, character designs, they are simple but do the job, however, what really sparkles here was the emphasis on nature, the vibrant color palette helped highlight the colorful vegetation that was complimented by the colorful flowers and bright open sky.\n\r\n- Sound (9/10):\r\nYes, I'm very huge on soundtracks, a good one can make a bad show better, and a bad one can push a good show lower in the scale. Voice acting was a blast, having to voice the same person while they get older, and you could still feel that the person is still himself/herself as in the resonance of their tone of voice is just astonishing. I loved the main theme background soundtrack of the movie so much so that it brought up a lot of nostalgic summer childhood memories. There is something about it that feels as warm and as calm as every other summer day.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nWhat I liked about Hotarubi no Mori e is the minimalistic inclusion of key characters, you have Hotaru and the masked spirit and that's it, of course, other characters like family members and classmates are present, but that doesn't take attention away from our main cast, and yet remain a vital player for both parties. Character development was massive, especially for Hotaru seeing that she grows older and gets more mature, and even the ageless spirit is there at the list looking nothing like before aside from his appearance as he gets more attached to Hotaru.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nSome of my rules of thumb for deciding if I really enjoyed a show or not is whether I checked the time continuously in hope for the said show to finish, and also the vivid thoughts about the show after I finish it, like making up speculations and what-if scenarios. I dove in with no expectations and ended up enjoying every second of this, might as well be my favorite romance movie.\n\r\n- Overall (8.8/10):\r\nThis will be the first thing I let out of my mouth if I was asked to recommend a movie of the genre, seriously, if you have three quarters of an hour to spare, this is differently one of the greatest pieces of animation you can experience, buckle up and get some popcorn, aaaaaand a spare of tissues just in case.\n"

            "content": "\n                My case with Fairy Gone as a series was always that of a disappointment. I wanted the show to be good, I wanted it to live up to its synopsis, but it seems, I gambled every hype I had at the time on its name, but this talk is especially directed at the first season, the gateway to it all. I have stressed long enough on the review for the first season on everything bad it did.\r\nSeason two, on the other hand, brings a lot of improvement to the table, but also slacks on some other, but the fact of the matter stays; the secondseason is a polished, more serious flavor of the first season.\n\r\nStory (6.7/10):\r\nA major convenience this season had over the previous one was the adoption of a more linear timeline that doesn't shift the focus too much. No excessive flashbacks that interrupt the action, but rather, those are initiated with a bit of a build-up that doesn't throw off the mood and attention.\r\nThe plot concludes on an open note, making an end to many plot threads and goals it set up at the start, but also raises a new question to - God protect us - a potential continuation of the story. That said, the plot does wrap, it does pay respect to the characters sacrificed throughout the run, it does eradicate the danger it was attempting to prevent.\r\nI feel like the classical linear progression really helped shape a clearer, more enjoyable sit through of a story, favoring the backlash random timeline shifting to more character-focused gimmicks that definitely helped put some respect on the name of a few characters that were perceived as \u201cuseless\u201d in the first season, *cough* Free *cough*.\n\r\nArt (7.8/10):\r\nI have been debating over this internally with myself, but I'm pretty sure the series knew a visual downgrade in terms of visual fidelity that we've grown to appreciate from the previous season. Aside from the highlights, characters look deformed, extremely idle and lazy at times with dead eyes and soulless faces.\r\nThe use of CGI continues still, but I can't help but point out how well they improved on hiding it, and making its use more uncommon compared to the first season.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nFairy Gone has always had a consistent visual and vocal bundle, but unlike the visuals that have known a dip in quality on a general note, the vocals, dare I say, are objectively better. I still can't decide between both seasons' openings and endings theme songs, both had a pair of party bangers for sure, however, from what covers the voice acting, the second season surely takes the cake. This season had a lot of resolutions set, so naturally, it was almost a constant emotional roller coaster for the main characters that required professional voice acting that touches, tingles, and pleasures your audible strings. The desperate screams were convincing.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nWhat I hated about this franchise the most, right after the nightmarish CGI spam was its collection of uninteresting characters. But hear me out.\r\nOn the visual level, they do please the eye, the designs are great and all, but the personality is almost non-existent. And I say almost. The first season had me confused as if I was sitting through a narrated story while looking at motionless dolls, this season was threatened with the same fate, but it luckily overcame it.\r\nFree, yes, the useless badass looking agent of Dorothea pulled down the cover that was slowing him down and actually showed some personality. He had a voice that can be heard, a vision that can be respected, and a body that acts instead of barking. The rest of the cast followed in his footsteps, and that alone highlighted a lot about the character, making me half-regretful from doubting the previous season.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nI realized midway the first season that I had made a grave mistake by part-taking on this franchise' hype train. The series was planned to serialize in 24 episodes, but then was split into two cours that had a season-length break in-between, I was struck, disappointed, and really annoyed from the fact that I will have to dedicate time for this boring shitshow that I had just barely finished the first season of, but perhaps, that break was just the right drive the franchise needed to improved and realize its mistakes. The result? A far better package that delivered and polished on every little thing I nitpicked on my review of the first season. It was an unexpectedly welcomed seasonal addition to my library, to say the least, it even had me think about rewatching the series from start to finish again, this time, with a full picture perception.\n\r\nOverall (7.1/10):\r\nI feel like Fairy Gone is one of those shows that I'll keep to myself, one of those shows that I don't feel like recommending to friends and not. Of course, my perspective is not absolute, it can be flawed, it can be changed, hell, who knew if this became one of my favorite shows if a rewatch was all I had to give it, but until then, Fairy Gone is not... gone, and I, at least at this moment, don't wish for its return. OVA and special episodes that expand on some of the cast will be welcomed any time though.\n"

            "content": "\n                Overlord II is a highly anticipated follow-up to the first season of the anime adaptation of the light novel series. The story picks up with Ainz, the former player Momonga who has become the ruler of the Great Tomb of Nazarick in this new world. Despite the similarities to the virtual reality game Yggdrasil, this world still holds many mysteries for Ainz to uncover.\n\r\nOne of the biggest strengths of Overlord II is its improvement over the first season. The world feels much bigger and more fleshed out, and the character development of the supporting cast is much more impressive. Ainz may have gotten less screentime compared to the first season, but the sacrifice was not for nothing as it allowed for more exploration and development of the other characters.\n\r\nThe interactions between the characters are amazing and really showcase the dynamics of the different members of Nazarick. Albedo, Demiurge, and the rest of Ainz's loyal guardians are a standout in the series, and the addition of new characters only adds to the richness of the world.\n\r\nAnother highlight of Overlord II is the growth and development of the main character, Ainz. While he may be a powerful undead sorcerer, he still struggles mentally to formulate and pose a great leader with the impending dangers of the Slane Theocracy and the possible existence of other former Yggdrasil players. This growth and development add depth to the character and make him more relatable and likable.\n\r\nIn conclusion, Overlord II is a fantastic follow-up to the first season. The improvements in character development, world-building, and interaction between characters make it a must-watch for fans of the series. Despite Ainz getting less screen time, the sacrifices made in order to explore and develop the supporting cast were well worth it. This is a series that deserves to be watched and appreciated for its growth and improvement over the first season.\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10.\n"

I'm talking like I was seriously surprised by the quality of that eye candy.\r\nThe same old opening and ending theme songs were used which are just so nostalgic and would have been a crime if they weren't included, to be frank.

But should you really? That's part of why I'm doing this, so you don't have to.\n\r\n\u201cAnother: MisakiMei - Shizukani\u201d is a short (4 minutes) music video that goes on a slide of cute chibi drawings of Mei accompanied with a soft and delicate angelic voice singing a lullaby that tingles your heart. We all know, the parent series ended with questionable sacrifices that left us with grieve at some point. But this one was totally different from the classic offering you'd get from a dark series such as Another.\n\r\nI could go on a lengthy essay on why I enjoyed this musical and why I think it has deep symbolism into it, but I really don't want to go all out for such a short animation and end up overdoing it. And let's keep it simple, nobody would want to read a full scroll on why you should or shouldn't watch a 4 minutes music video.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nThe song was really good, something differently worthy of making it into my Otaku music collection, it's so relaxing and sweet it had me click the replay button right off the bat, and that's something very obscure to me I could have nearly googled how to replay the video (r/thathappened), not really, I just was trying to put in perspective how good the song really is.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nYou're not getting something phenomenal here, it's all about the music really. The best there is are still images of Chibi Mei doing quite poses layered on top of various background indicating a sequential order of episodes? (There were a class and a beach!). Again, I'm not really complaining, at least it's not some stupid CGI models screaming in pain (looking at you Overload 3 ~gaze~).\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nIt was really fun and wholesome, for me at least. I appreciate good music and vocal quality and I felt like home with \u201cAnother: Misaki Mei - Shizukani\u201d. It seriously didn't take more than seconds in when I told myself, I could be in wonderland the next 4 minutes until it flew like a lightning bolt. Thank God the replay button is a thing.\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nIn general, it doesn't have to be about the fans of the series that are queen on consuming anything related. All it takes is being a music enthusiast and you are in a great vocal ride for a few minutes.\n"

            "content": "\n                I can't tell you how many times I heard the sentence \u201cWatch Re:Zero\u201d. Be it from friends, random online recommendations, the midst of a 2 hours long documentary on shrimps, or on national television. Seriously, I've been haunted by this name and it, unfortunately, contributed more to me avoiding it. Simply put, \u201cIsekai trash\u201d doesn't deserve my attention.\n\r\nI was wrong.\n\r\nFast forward many years later, I'm sitting home by myself, I have a busy schedule tomorrow at work, but how do I kill this hour of time until I fall asleep? I know, watch something generic that my eyes would better shut off for the day.I ended up sleeping 8 hours later and almost missing work that day. But that's not for a good reason necessarily.\n\r\n\u201cShock value\u201d is a big factor that contributes to a lot of other shows and movies, but Re:Zero knows how powerful it can be and this, abuses the shit out of it. Every episode makes it hard to stop there, and therefore basically spells it out for you that you should proceed to the next episode, it's both an effective way, and a trying demeanor that gets old real quick but nonetheless, helps the binge positively. Basically put, one of those shows that would have done more damage had I watched it weekly back in the day.\n\r\nTo call Re:Zero a masterpiece would be a slap on the face for many incredible shows out there, but the show is far from being a bad joke on a Saturday evening. For than anything, to the naked eye, Re:Zero really is a mediocre attempt at a modern Isekai, a shameless reskin to your most generic blueprint for what makes for the Isekai of the season, but really across the board, a lot of stereotypes are flipped on their heads, something very much appreciated is how Subaru is NOT the overpowered hero that saves the day and advocates the power of friendship every chance he gets, it feels more like a curse than an adventure for him and the viewer.\n\r\nPowers that rewind time can be very tricky to handle, but the fact that Subaru makes the least effort to divert and showcase different perspectives for the same event countless times does lessen the boredom of rewinding over and over again. It also adds to the loneliness and despair that contribute to his massive, non-ending character development.\n\r\nThe art screams of 2016, a wild lawless era where every show took on the same form factor and abandoned any sense of innovation. Really, nothing can be said about either the animation or the character designs, there is a certain mainstream fantasy aura that all Isekai seem to inherit, and Re:Zero is by no means special in that regard. In my earnest opinion, it's passable.\n\r\nI was \ud83e\udd0f close to dropping the score for audio-related production, but damn, was the voice acting masterfull in this one. I feel like Subaru's Seiyuu in particular was recorded during extended sessions of medieval torture, the screeches that escape his voice in some of those scenes bring about a special kind of shivers that has the perfect amount of disturbance to deliver on the suffering moments. And then there is Emilia's and Rem's tingly soft voice that I couldn't get enough of. More praising to the star here, Subaru's constant shift between confident, delinquent lines to the utmost desperate and apologetic screams of agony and despair sold the show for me.\n\r\nFirst of all, I'm glad I get the Rem memes now.\r\nSubaru as a case of study character brings about something that I'd say was the only arguable original spin the show had on the Isekai formal. Hate him however you want, Subaru is probably one of the most relatable protagonists out there. We love him because he presents there good in all of us, and we hate him because he exposes the bad in all of us. He's a selfish, self-centered teen that strives to better his outlook on the world and close friends and loved ones by overcoming and reliving the most horrifying realities that come up his way. Some of the actions he makes stand for the cringiest, strongest second-handed embarrassment out there, but the glow-up and the growth he gets when he overcomes them are satisfying beyond belief.\n\r\nIt's hard to state what really drew me into the show, the easiest guess is the shock value, but even that does get old super quick, it's almost the faint desire and self-reflection that you might see in Subaru, you want the poor soul to succeed, you want to see him succeed, it's sympathy more than anything else.\n\r\nOverall: 8.0/10\n"

There is really no heavy plotwhirlpools or anything of that depth, just our characters going through some fun. With the first episode having the whole crew go on a skiing vacation where some mysterious fella tries to kill Yato, while the latter spends time trying to capture his killer.\r\nThe second OVA episode focuses on the crew going to Capypa, while Hiyori is still having nightmares from what happened there the last time she went, with Yato trying to cheer her up.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nI can at least thus far say, the viewers can rest assured, and not worry about the quality of the animation, because it remains consistent throughout the 23 minutes couple of episodes, nothing to bash or drag way too much here, here's an above average work of animation, just enjoy the plot.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nAside from the fabulous opening and ending theme songs nothing stands out in a very memorable manner. Again, it was really great having to see those work of arts once another time. The voice acting was really well done for a comedic atmosphere.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nAs I said before, the whole gang had the focus of this OVA, all of your lovable characters, I like how nobody was by any chance annoying. Everybody had some sort of screentime, they had the chance to speak some words and just be there for the sake of having a good time.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nThe last season's OVA was fantastic, but this one was way more fun to keep up with, both episodes are very wholesome and engaging, I really need a third season and a good complimentary OVA too.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nI would differently recommend this OVA for the parent's show's fans, especial the people into comedy, I've had some great giggles every here and there.\n"

While browsing the seasonal chart, picking up shows that I caught my interest until I ended up with an odd number. I love my numbers, but even more so, the even ones, so Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai was the pick that balanced up my seasonal collection of the time, hoping I would grow fond of it, episodes by episode, it turned up to be even better than the shows I was especially hyped about.\r\nEventually, the season ended, and the show left a noticeable void that I was only able to overcome whenI knew about the second season's announcement, and it was in the same year. Sweet.\n\r\nBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! was just the continuation I was waiting for; a sequel that lives up to your expectation, airing relatively shortly after its prequel when the anticipation is still present, and the community is still engaging.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nThe classic Harem trope embracing, mondegreen centered waifu driven slice of life continues in a manner that does not discard its identity. It doesn't attempt to bringing anything new to the table, risking throwing off devoted fans, it does not innovate and encloses on what made it so loveable. It only gifts back what we've grown to love about it, almost as both seasons were no more than just a cour that went together back to back with no chronological shifts in-between. Naryuki's season one on the last night was the same Naryuki the next morning in season two, and so were the other girls.\r\nFollowing the direct events of the first season, Naryuki continues to help the main trio, Ogata, Furahashi, and Uruka while also keeping his acquaintance with Kirisu sensei and Kiminami.\r\nAs the school year comes to a close, and everyone is forced to make their life-changing decision, they each learn to overcome their differences and strengthen their bonds further so that the inevitable parting is never too harsh on any of them.\n\r\nThe pacing and linear plot progression kept up the semi-episodic serialization which works perfectly with the short character arcs that occupy the greater part of the series, escaping from the enclosing dead-line that was the end of the school year.\n\r\nArt (7.6/10):\r\nI would say that the premise of Harem shows lies within the characters and plot interactions rather than the visual notes. However, the power of the visual is an important aspect that gives or takes points from a Waifu candidate.\r\nBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! keeps up a generic visual facade, with clunky designs that can easily mistake the main characters from background crowds. That is if it wasn't for the clever and assertive use of vibrant colors to highlight them apart.\r\nIt's arguably the standard in the Harem blueprint that the visual quality and attention to details always shifts towards the Waifus, the main selling point of this type of shows, the protagonist always settles with probably the most generic and boring design as a way of making him or her relatable to the viewer; as the protagonist's sole purpose is to link the Waifu gang, with the Waifus themselves are there to gain the audience's praise.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nIf there was anything that stuck with me after finishing the first season, it was the opening and ending bundle it featured throughout its run. The second season inherited the same fidelity when it came to the vocals. Both the opening and ending theme songs were great, very considering to the mood and atmosphere that goes with the show.\r\nThe voice acting is as good as the first season, great audible performances that encapsulated the frequent comedic inserts so well that the tone of voices delivered alone was able to draw out some laughter.\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\r\nI've talked about this before, I'll assert it more again. Characters are the single most important aspect that makes a Harem stand out, without it, a Harem is just a sorry excuse for one. Characters with no personality or likable, relatable, or interesting traits can easily affect and downgrade everything else that the show has going for it.\r\nAnother season, more character development for everyone.\r\nWhat I really appreciate about this season over the last one is how drastically Nariyuki grows as both a mentor, a big brother, and a person as a whole, not just the main girls, but the protagonist as well shows a lot to be developed. He's no saint, he makes mistake, and he works hard to correct them and improve himself as he does helping others improving themselves as well that it goes full circle in the greater scale of things.\r\nAnother great example of good character development shows on Furuhashi's sake. I never really invested in her, I never genuinely cheered for her, but this season made me do just that without even realizing it, I went from a firm believer in the Uruka x Naryuki ship to having a respectful consideration to Furuhashi all in a couple of episodes. Sadly the Ogata bandwagon wasn't as strong in this one, and that was my first ship when I started the show, however, the Uruka ship keeps sailing, hoping that in the third season (Please give it to us) she would take the lead once again.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI knew I wanted to watch more ever since I finished the first season.\r\nThe spectacle that grew on me at the start of the year has only grown even more by the end of it, week after week following these high schoolers ' hilarious, dramatic, and emotional ordeals, cheering for different ships every now and then. Signing along with the theme songs and engaging in fan Waifu discussions. It was priceless, and only fueling my need for the third season.\n\r\nOverall (8.02/10):\r\nBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is a shining gem in a genre that has gained a toxic cult following that throws off newcomers. It is such a simple premise that gains your back tons of enjoyment, and this Anime shows that by example. Great characters, frequent hilarity, and Mary Sue Waifus. If you've already made it passed the first season and are hungry for more, don't hesitate, just WATCH!\n"

But not always.\r\nIn some few shows, especially the short ones, the massive character rooster can be pretty overwhelming and hard to keep up with, a lot of new names all at ones can ruin great moments and distract you from important conversations, but 91 Days Recap at least nails explicitly at its core with this one.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nAs simple as it can get, a young kid survives the massacre of his own family and devotes his lifeto get the revenge. Making a come back after 7 years and penetrating the family responsible undercovered as one of their members, and it gets much more complex as it goes on.\r\nThe pacing here couldn't really be any good more than it already is, not too rushed or too slow.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nAs simple as it looks, the animation has some quality to it here. The art style looks very generic but not funky or bad, every move is fluid and complementary to the fast-paced music as well.\r\nI like the approach they took with presenting faces and expressions, you don't see any characters having their eyes taking half the space on their face. The art style looks a lot realistic than what you get nowadays, seeing how this is a modern series.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI absolutely love the opening and end theme songs, let's not forget the soundtracks. One other thing that made me glad to have chosen the DUB version was the accurate translation and accent imitation. All the voices matched their portrayed faces and attitudes perfectly.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nI have no problem with the characters, of course, I dislike some but for a reason is that you as the viewer are supposed to not like them, something that I think this show does perfectly.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI'm not much of a recap fanboy, but I like me some good ones, and this one didn't disappoint. It's just a retelling of the first 7 episodes focusing on highlights that have come to pass, just what I needed with this type of shows.\n\r\n- Overall (7.9/10):\r\nI wouldn't actually recommend this if you're not too invested in the show, but it's always fun to pick up old stuff that you didn't notice at the start or just to refresh your memory on the big bangs that have happened. Anyways, this was a solid recap in my eyes.\n"

            "content": "\n                High School DxD, is somewhat a very controversial series, that you're dared to speak its name out loud in public, but then again, let's ask the fans, are you watching it for the plot, or for your twisted perverted inner self? sometimes, a good story can be disguised by a hard to knock off skin, in this case, the over the top fanservice, but is there a worthy plot to follow under this still? The one thing I'm sure of is that there is a fine line between Ichi Anime, and straight up Hentai, and High School DxD could be one of the rare fewthat lie upright on that line.\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nI really can't milk anything out of this, spaghetti piece of fiction, the plot revolves around conflicts between Demons, Angles, and Fallen angels but with a twist being that 90% of the cast are naked erotic girls, with the majority being underaged which is dangerous on its own.\r\nOur main character is the typical pervert protagonist, whose only care in the world is to build a Harem of his own, and I'd dare every 13 years old teen to not want the same!\r\nOur Protagonist, Issei is on the demons side, blessed with a powerful gear that all the others thrive to possess, but of course it couldn't be in the possession of anybody else rather than a typical never-give-up teen who can't think of anything innocent in a straight time without several perverted thought breaks every 10 seconds.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nUnlike the hardly engaging plot, the animation is at least decent to amazing, the focus, of course, goes to the erotic female anatomy, and half of the budget is gone into animating those jiggly breast movements that appeared to be strongly defying the law of basic physics every friction of muscle magic, next time they are going to be in accordance of one's blinking, I can see that coming at least.\r\nThe animation is mostly fine, I can go for long without being bored looking at those amazing swordfights, and let's be real here, I'm a normal guy, so the \u201cNATURAL\u201d jiggly reactions on \u201cCERTAIN\u201c body parts are provoking as well.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nProbably the only memorable aspect of this, I could go for long periods of time and still recall this amazing overwhelming soundtrack, and I can already feel the nostalgia of it, I don't know, there is just something  about the smooth violin notes that tingle me, giving me goosebumps every so often, or so that the action displayed on the screen itself.\r\nThe Opening them song was okay, nothing to praise or anything, but it's the OST where the glory is at.\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\r\nSadly, I couldn't find characters that click to me, characters whom I care about, and pray to not get harmed or killed, everybody is a comic relief punching bag especially the protagonist, there are absolutely no noticeable traits to remember rather than the yet erotic body bumps on the female cast. You could literally make a fortune out of somebody pillows here.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nDespite its many downfalls, I would be a lier if I said I hated this show, I genuinely had fun watching this, and I'm coming straight up, no, not because of the plot, not because of the characters either, while the OST was phenomenal, excuse my vulgar language, the fanservice was what kept me going, I'm not a creep, and I don't get boners from watching 2D characters, but this one had me rooting for the main character, a simpleton that lost his way to the order of the baldy twins, something about him that's relatable.\n\r\n- Overall (7.0/10):\r\nI would never recommend watching this with family, only close friends, this is no way family friendly, and honestly, sometimes it's more of another hentai than the Anime it was meant to be, or maybe, it's just not the hentai it was meant to be.\r\nUnless you're in for some fanservice, and lighthearted comedy, do not breach into this expecting a masterpiece or a story to remember.\n"

I mean, who wouldn't want to watch a bizarre mix of 3D, 2D, and stop-motion visuals, all set to the tune of Linked Horizon's \"Akatsuki no Chinkonka?\" It's like a weird amalgamation of all the animation styles you never knew you needed.\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the nostalgia factor. This song is sure to take you back to a time when you were just a weelad or lass, dreaming of the day you could watch an animated music video that leaves you with more questions than answers.\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, the visuals are actually pretty creative, even if they make you feel like you're trapped in some kind of twisted, alternate universe. And who doesn't love a good mix of 3D and stop motion? It's like watching two completely different styles of animation fight to the death for your attention.\n\r\nAll in all, \"Akatsuki no Chinkonka\" is a trip, to say the least. So if you're in the mood for something that's equal parts nostalgia, confusion, and creativity, this one's definitely worth a watch.\n"

            "content": "\n                Sports Anime are as distant from me as Anime, in general, was just 3-4 years ago, even now, it's unbelievable to me how many different shows and genres I got into in this time period, and still, no sports Anime was one of them, so when it came to it, Kuroko no Basket, a specific sports show that people pair up with Dragonball Z for some reason was my gateway into the genre.\r\nYes, indeed, I had a primary idea of the show as one where superhuman highschoolers pulling all the stops that would make NBA professionals look like amateur street-ball players. I mean, basic Animelogic, so it's no biggy, let's start.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nSports Anime were always a mystery to me, are they like drama that happens between the characters and whatever sports they are playing is just there to act as filler? That must be it, right? It can't be all games and matches of whatever sport they are playing, that would be boring, repetitive and badly paced, I mean, we're talking about similar games that take place in a pre-determined time period in a single enclosed place, just how are you going to create a storytelling device from that? Am I going crazy for assuming this?\n\r\nI totally was going crazy for thinking that.\n\r\nThis was a game-changer for me. Several games pre*planed to happen, all that's left to do is a few training montages and a lot of monologuing during the game, prior to every pass and possibly every brain-cell eruption. While that has a special charm of its own, it does suffer from the expected drawbacks you'd think it would.\n\r\nRepetition can kill immersion. Some games definitely feel like filler, but some others are built up intensely that definitely leads to a satisfying delivery. The pacing can really fall off, sometimes the dialog is just not that interesting, mainly over-reacting to every muscle flinch, you get the idea.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nIf anything, this show is a looker. Pure sport sakuga that gets your lazy body excited, pumps blood into your dead veins, and makes you want to pick up a Basketball and hit the nearest playground.\r\nWhen hands swiftly dribble the ball and the muscles fluidly shake off sweat drops, yeah, sweat, that disgusting substance that rolls out the eye is instantly transformed into buckets of confetti that compliments the scenery perfectly. The sight of danking, free playing, and epic sneaky passes are the right talk here. When visual storytelling is that good, it really makes your body crave the topic no matter how unrealistic it is.\n\r\n- Sound (7.8/10):\r\nI'm an audible homie, I love it when an Anime treats me to a good set of opening and ending songs, but Kuroko no Basket barely passed my picky quota. Just when I started getting used to the first OP, which is fantastic by the way, they introduced a horrid one that completely destroyed my excitement at the start of every episode, the song just didn't do it for me, or at least, its beginning. The endings weren't anything that sticks to the mind either, but they were fine I guess.\r\nThe OSTs, however, were balling, seriously, is this another Bleach? With the blood pumping sports-y moment, it hits right on the spot, or should I say, sound wave, when the right tracks play at the right time, it adds so much.\r\nThe voice acting was good, they definitely draw out the feelings of the speaker, although sometimes, crying over a Basketball game can get a little bit overwhelming.\n\r\n- Characters (7.5/10):\r\nProbably was of the most conflicting aspects of this show lies on its characters, in one hand, you have the main characters whose motivations and goals are as vague as Basketball's rule were to me prior to watching this, but in the other hand, the supporting cast is just right on point, dare I say, they single-handedly carry on the show even if Kagami or Kuroko were to never exist.\r\nKuroko, the dude whose name is titling the show is for the lack of better words, a dead mime, I've probably seen more interesting wooden planks in my years, probably the only thing that peaks the slightest amount of interest around him is how they keep calling him the sixth phantom member of the generation of miracles, the dude who the show is named after is carried by his old teammates whom themselves carry the show, I'm starting to lose touch with sense just writing about him. It's not that he is unlikeable or anything, it's more of how insignificant he is in front of every other character even though his protagonistic status.\r\nKagame too sufferers from this flaw, although, he does have a real presence that can affect their games drastically. Probably he would stand as a second Kuroko if it wasn't for their \u201cinvisibility\u201d.\r\nRiko is a fine supportive figure as well, her relationship with everybody in the team is something to praise, for once, I love a female significant character that's really there for the plot's sake rather than fanservice.\n\r\nThe rest of Seirin's team stand as great supportive characters, all feel different in the way they interact with the plot, they have unique treats and vibes, they add so much to conversations and overall don't feel like generic background crowd that was meant to just stand there as filler.\r\nThe generation of miracle members introduced in this season, Kise, Midorima and Aomine are just fantastic, really, probably the only remarkable thing that sells this show completely, their rivalry is more than a gimmick that's just there, it contributes to the plot and makes for most of the blood rushing moments.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI've never been big on Basketball before while acknowledging its popularity, I just never was in the right mindset to sit down and derive any sort of enjoyment from watching sain people dribbling a rubber mass around and sweat over it like crazy, that is until Anime normalized that for me, and it was none other than Kuroko that took that virginity away. And I'm not complaining. Hanging on the air for an unreasonable amount of second while stressing over lengthy monologues never sounded so appealing and fun to me, the matches kept me over the edge on my seat, the anticipation at every pass was thrilling all the while your villain of the week is steering around the stakes.\n\r\n- Overall (7.86/10):\r\nIf you're looking for an Anime-first sports show you'll be in the right place, wearing the right common sense proofing gear as this is as close to Basketball as Dragonball is to martial arts. It's too over the top that it pushes some realistic boundaries. With that said, if you're in the right mindset for that kind of shows, it doesn't take anything from the enjoyment factor, at the end of the day, it's epic Basketball fest that you're getting into and it's awesome.\n"

            "content": "\n                It's a given that talking about the best and most influential cinematic Anime experiences, My Neighbor Totoro is a familiar name that's always brought up along with the likes of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, no matter how the themes and the target audiences may vary, quality is always looked up upon fondly.\r\nIt's not in my nature to jump on stories like My Neighbor Totoro, but the fame that surrounds it always made me look think about giving it a chance, there is nothing that might come up as horrible from a critically claimed masterpiece that nobody seems to forget about even 32 years later.\n\r\nStory(8/10):\r\nWe all know how Studio Ghibli takes the most simple of concepts and fleshes it out and its surrounding world to create a fantasy epic that the movie only ends up taking a tiny sneak peek out of.\r\nSatsuki and Mei, two happy-go-lucky siblings move into their new house somewhere in the sticks that start off chasing dust bunnies to somehow tangled in a magical world of an endless invisible journey with their \u201cweird\u201d neighbor they call Totoro, floating on tops and riding car buses.\r\nA very fantasy-based plot that also discusses a coming of age tale like no other.\n\r\nArt (9.3/10):\r\nUndoubtedly, Studio Ghibli are crowned masters in the animation industry, they have repeatedly set industry standards over and over again and My Neighbor Totoro was yet another masterpiece under their name.\r\nEverything from astronomical facial expressions that she on every cry, every spoken word, and acrobatic movement. The backgrounds and landscapes are beautifully crafted with unmatched atmospherical vibes almost radiating out.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nAlong with the groundbreaking visuals that Ghibli Studio seems to outdo themselves in with every movie release, the sound design is one of the best. There is a specific caliber of OST mastery that can enhance a fantasy story like My Neighbor Totoro.\r\nThe voice acting was superb, even for something produced 32 years ago, it felt seamless and on par with the stuff we get today.\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\r\nMany people would start wars declaring that either Mei or Totoro is the real main character, but I'd argue that it was the sense of the word itself, the invisible part of the world that only Mei and her sister seem to interact with. Without it, there would be nothing happening in the movie.\r\nThe entire cast of characters is, each plays their role and it shows on the grand scale of things likable, the father, the granny, and even the neighboring kid.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.2/10):\r\nWhat a time travel this was.\r\nBetween the humor, the drama, and the adventure, my mind was sunk into the whole thing like I'm no longer chilling on my bed, staring at a flat-screen, totally immersed in the two children's lives, equally excited to when they see Totoro next.\r\nIt's staggering how a movie obviously made for children and still appeal to an adult audience, goes to show how no matter we get old, there is always going to be a twerpy little child inside all of us. The stakes were balanced well between not being too serious for a kids' adventure and not too carefree that nothing really matters.\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nAll in all, Totoro was an experience. I may be too old to see the movie, but Ghibli Studio always has something for everyone in their movies.\r\nFor a movie, the transition between the calm and the storm is really felt throughout, you feel like spending time with the character, for a movie that spans just about an hour and a half to feel like an entire lifetime spent with the characters and the world is staggering, but also not surprising for Studio Ghibli.\r\nA final word of truth, sitting through the entire thing was very enjoyable but also not as rewarding. It's always great to go back and see what the past has labeled as a masterpiece and what it looks like when compared to today's releases, and again, Studio Ghibli delivers, breaking the strains of time and expectations. Truly a good family-friendly watch, suitable for all ages and demographics.\n"

And the adventures, as small as they may be, are always inviting and friendly to the third party that is the audience.\n\r\nThe story at hand takes place somewhere between Logue town and the entrance to the Grand Line, possibly before the WarshipIsland. The crew has not seen what the Grand Line has in store, so meeting up with these colossal sea monsters must have been a shocking nightmare to some, and a challenging foe to others. With the crew being still at its earliest, only the first five members present, they blend rather well into the story, probably aside from Sanji would probably have less screen time than some of the side-characters.\n\r\nAl in all, it is a quick telling of yet another odd adventure out of many that the Straw Hats part-take in. Pretty generic good pirates save civilians from bad pirate, with the re-occurring trope of the little kid who starts off as dispising said pirates and ends up rooting for the Straw Hats by the end of it.\n"

As the song progresses, we see them grow and evolve as they go through different adventures and challenges together. The animation style is cartoony and childish, fitting perfectly with the spirit of Bojji and Kage's friendship.The childish art style helps to emphasize the innocence and pure bond of friendship between the two characters.\n\r\nThe video also features scenes from the series, including the iconic moments between Bojji and Kage as they help each other through their journey. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the colors are vibrant and eye-catching. The video is also well-edited and the cuts are seamless, making it easy to follow the story.\n\r\nOne of the most striking aspects of the video is the way it showcases the bond between Bojji and Kage, and how their friendship is the backbone of the series. The lyrics of the song, \"Oz.\" by Yama, also adds to the emotional impact, with lines like \"Even though we're small, we can still shine,\" and \"Together, we're unstoppable.\" The song and the video work together to deliver a powerful message of friendship, positivity, and courage.\n"

The characters have always been diverse, appealing, and interactive with their rolls, you know the usual drill, a bunch of pirates sailing for wining the Pirate King's crown, fair enough, but another day, they might undertake Marine clothing, and be well integrated with the very opposing force they have, get abducted by a ghost ship and in return act like mindless zombies, no one will question them. If that it's how easy it is, have them part-take into a theater,the play doesn't even need a proper script to be interesting, just have them there, pushing off the common trap of mocking their 3 walled reality. That was the drill in this special episode.\n\r\nTaking advantage of this easy integration gift, The Straw Hats take different roles in a theater, each fighting for the spotlight on the stage, making for some very oddly cursed scenes, like Robin hyper-energetically pulling off a ballerina dance in front of everyone with unmatched agility, shocking even her crew members, while Luffy under-takes a roll of an acrobatic monkey, how fitting. That is, for the first half until they were taken as pirates, and then it pulls back to the average drill. Label them as scummy pirates, trashed them out of the theater and stand there while (mostly\u00e0 Luffy singlehandedly changes their view of \u201cAll pirates are bad\u201d.\n"

I can't be wrong two times in a row with the same show, right?\n\r\nI was wrong yet again.\n\r\nThere was so much wrong with this season, and now, that I have already finished the second part, I would have been muchbetter had the two parts made up one single season, but they just had to do it.\n\r\nWhat hurt me more is the fact that the show really stood up strong with the first installment, but went for an entirely different, slowed, and rather boring plot. For starters, the whole thing felt like an oozing bite-size exposition of a much grander arc that honestly would have been better served in a more fast-paced manner. The fact that we've been stuck in the same location, doing the same things over and over again, it reminded me of the awful cringe-worthy middle part of the first season when Subaru made the same mistakes over and over again. Displaying a great deal of insignificant repetitive plotline that gets on your nerve as early as episode three.\n\r\nGone is this angelic Mary-Sue picture that season one painted over Emilia, she's been exposed as the weak, insecure dead weight to everybody around her, which is, in all honesty, a good thing for her character, a great weakness that she'll have to overcome one day. But the lack of any noticeable improvement during the entire season really takes a toll on everything, 12 episodes where you feel like nothing is happening, and everyone is stuck on a non-ending loop that promises no conclusion.\n\r\nAs I said, this part is more of a preparation for whatever comes next, and I can't help but think the business handshake that led to this decision was misled in all the wrong ways.\n"

            "content": "\n                You know what I was told? I was told that Arthropod venom is one of the worst and most deadly venoms out there, but I guess science batted an eye on the more so deadly competitor known as nostalgia. Ever since I was little, and much like every other Arabian kid, a TV channel by the name of \u201cSpacetoon\u201d was what made all of those kids' childhood, \u201cThe channel of future youngsters\u201d was the slogan, and it was no stretch. Among the many classics they used to air was \u201cBlack Cat\u201d, with its nostalgic opening theme song and key characters, you couldn't call yourself afan if you haven't at least rewatched the series more than twice and recall the chronological order of events by heart. But over the +10 years that have passed since those simpler days, the plot, in general, had already faded from my memory and it was time to revisit the nostalgic classic once again and see if it holds up to today's standards.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nHeavily reliant on mythology and religious references, a story set on a post-war setting where conflict is still being fueled for what the losses that have already been suffered from weren't enough. A secret organization by the name of Chronos reigns from the shadows in pursuit of true peace by the means of blood and assassination, standing on the lead of its ranks numbered agents that go from 1 and increasing reaching number 13, that would be Train Heartnet, one of the protagonists of the series that seeks freedom and takes from Chronos a false escape from his intent of murder, little did he know soon enough that he will be freed with the help of Saya Minatsuki, a sweeper that helped him see the world in a different perspective.\r\nUnlike the real-world intuitive definition of a sweeper, sweepers here are people, much like freelance bounty hunters that arrest criminals alive in a manner that contradicts the methods of Chronos but also not completely oppose them. That was pretty much the set up for the story without spoiling any vital information.\r\nOne thing they nailed here is the balance of comedy and action that very few shows manage to achieve (ex; One Piece), a running theme here seems to be cat humor, so, for cat lovers out there, you're in for some minimalistic chibi cat figures, in the other hand comes the badassness, everything from the cool poses, epic entrances, badass black cloaks and guns, enough to draw in your interest in fights. However, it seems they went the wrong turn with that, most fights are just a mess of complicated poorly juxtaposed frames that barely make sense, it makes it hard to keep up and follow what's going on, for the most part, add to that the frequently low FPS moments that make my potato computer running Minecraft shaders look like a champ.\r\nOne misconception in anime is that if a show is fast-paced and straightforward, it creates opportunities for better story execution and character development, that is if done right. Black Cat suffers from consistency in pacing, it's fast yes, but faster than the flow of the story. The main quest is about revenge and redemption after all, but it doesn't leave much space for side quests to be fleshed out, and thus, every other side episode so to speak, feels like watching a horrible filler from the deepest pits of Naruto Shippuden's filler hell.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nPersonally, I adore the art style, I would describe it as that of a vampire-ish dark vibe, heavy on sharp edges but not quite as sharp as Code Geass's character's chins, God lord, those are deadly (Not to say that Code Geass is a horrible show, like seriously, if you haven't watched yet, what are you waiting for?). Having the show portrays a light-hearted comedy, it doesn't fall short on it being dark, remember, this show is about assassins, bounty hunters, a world of conflict, and if the title \u201cBlack Cat\u201d wasn't enough to emphasize, the art style surely does. The color palette is dark, but unlike other shows where it gets so dark that it's difficult to see anything on the screen, Black Cat knew when to stop. Those mix of aspects created a certain atmosphere to the story that you don't get from any other shows, I would say, it's the closest you can get to the Resident Evil 4 video game (you know what greatness you're getting now).\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nWhilst typing this, I'm still on an intense debate in my head whether I find the Arabic version of the opening theme song or the original Japanese version the better one, nostalgia is a biased factor here, but that doesn't make the other any less good. I mean, it's \u201cI can listen to this all day\u201d material going as far as \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d type of song. What I love about it is how soft and light it starts out and how quietly strong it gets near the end, makes for a perfect preparation to get you in the mood for some Train wrecking (that was intended). I'm glad they kept the same opening theme song throughout the whole run, with updated visuals midway the show, and two great ending theme songs to kind of cal you down at the end of each episode.\r\nI listened to both the English dubbed and subbed versions before choosing which one to go by, spoiler alert, it was the English sub, however, that didn't make the dubbed version look any less immersive, the main voices were spectacular, but I still wanted to go by the original version to kind of experience it the way it was made. So, for those who are deciding which one to watch, I recommend both, you might as well watch both alternating between one and other any time you see fit.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nCharacters make half the show they say, and they couldn't be wrong, I mean look at Taboo Tatoo, that's what you get when you populate a story with potential with shallow characters, absolutely terrible. Black Cat, on the other hand, did a decent job keeping things as neutral as they are.\r\nLiterally, every single character had a great development throughout, the initial Train is not the Train five episodes later, and the same Train is not the Train of later either, and that doesn't go for only main characters.\r\nThere wasn't any annoying pitiful figure that made you snap out every time they spoke, I liked every single one of them and even had my favorites as well. Buuuuuuut, an issue with lacking backstories and plausible plot holes did leave their marks, some characters were indeed fleshed out but only compared to the neglected individuals, I'm not asking for a focusing ark for every single fraction of dirt. A character needs motive and purpose, it needs to follow an ideology or else, it falls under the nouveau-rich category from the background crowd.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nNostalgia is a drug, I remember watching this show like it was like no other, it's safe to say that it was way below my expectations. Did it age well, pr-oba--b-l-y???! I'd feel guilty of admitting it, there were strong moments, but there were also weak moments that didn't live up to what I remember.\r\nI still laughed at the same exact old jokes (it seems parts of me never got old), I still liked the characters and found the story mildly interesting.\r\nAt the start of my rewatch, I went all out, a barking nostalgia dog claiming that I can binge it in no time, but the effect of the drug wore off near the two-digit episodes, and the rest was history. A humble number of episodes were just plain boring, \u201cI fell asleep while watching X\u201d material. Not my proudest come back in any respect, it seems I learned to disregard nostalgia the hard way, but the actual good parts were just enough refreshment to get me all strong and recovered.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nAs far as shounen shows, Black Cat had its unique take on the genre, nothing revolutionary, but it certainly is way different than your modern shounen shows (My Hero Academia, Black Clover...). If you want to revisit what old shows used to be like, Black Cat does a good job retaining that fashion and atmosphere, the feelings that you're sent back to 2005 for 20 minutes, that's one approach to time travel. Now, for you people who have nostalgic memories to the show, please proceed with caution, the show that blew your mind back then may never feel the same, so tone down the expectations, but don't make my words scare you, our little nostalgic friend here still has its old special charm.\n"

The character designs are consistently on point and the attention to detail is impeccable. Even the small moments of idle talking and casual blinking are enhanced by the amazing character animation.\n\r\nBut let's not forget about the hilarious comedy that the show is known for. \"Kaguya-sama\" never fails to deliver on the laughs, with its clever writing and excellent comedic timing. The dynamic between the main characters, Kaguya and Miyuki, is puregold and their back-and-forth banter never fails to amuse.\n\r\nBut what really sets \"Ultra Romantic\" apart from its prequels is the satisfying and heartwarming ending. The show does a great job of wrapping up all the loose plot threads and giving the characters the endings they deserve. It's a testament to the show's writing that it can be both hilarious and emotionally resonant at the same time.\n\r\nAnother standout in this season is the voice acting. The entire cast is top-notch, with each character's performance perfectly capturing their unique personalities and mannerisms. The standout, of course, is Aoi Koga as Kaguya Shinomiya, who manages to be both hilarious and endearing as the haughty, love-struck vice president.\n\r\nThe music, too, is a highlight. The opening theme is an upbeat and catchy tune that perfectly captures the energetic, romantic atmosphere of the show. The ending theme is a slower, more contemplative song that reflects the more introspective moments of the show. Both songs are a pleasure to listen to and really enhance the overall viewing experience.\n\r\nBut it's not all about the technical aspects - the writing in \"Kaguya-sama: Love is War\" is consistently sharp and hilarious. The show is full of clever, well-timed jokes and cleverly written dialogue that always manages to land. The ending in particular is satisfying, bringing the show's central love triangle to a satisfying and well-earned resolution.\n\r\nOverall, \"Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic\" is a must-watch for fans of the series and newcomers alike. The consistently great animation, humorous comedy, and top-notch voice acting and music make it a standout in the crowded world of anime. If you haven't already, be sure to give this season a watch \u2013 you won't be disappointed. So, I highly recommend this season to all anime lovers out there. It's peak shoujo and a real treat for the senses.\n\r\n8.2/10.\n"

Probably, a weeby mentality like yours would almost strictly use this for its \u201cresearch\u201d department as a production tool of high value, but let's keep that argument low on notice.\r\nLet's keep everyone's kink out of this, and focus on a more pure intention, making the greatest Anime show out of the genres you enjoy, that's a winin sanity's book.\r\nJust like professor Utonium, open up the mixer, drop in a mesh of Mecha, adding some Ecchi, a few elements of hyper action won't hurt either, something of this and some of that and by a flicker of a switch, you get Kill la Kill. An urban alienated show filled with non-stop action and intense screaming, battle after battle almost every episode driving off a story of revenge and search of identity amid a global conflict between man and... clothing? Trust me, it doesn't stop there, this show is weird.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nBefore starting, let me confirm the weirdness I just spoke, you don't have to take the show seriously to enjoy it. Just go with the flow. So clothing is evil...\n\n\r\n...Pfff, this one is not going to be easy, would it? Let's just forget about clothing for now.\r\nRyuko, a loud and violent teenage girl that takes a questionably giant half-scissor-blade with her t-to school (What now?) and everywhere she goes, smothered in hate for the head of the student council of her school, Kiruin Satsuki, a snob high-and-mighty looking, tea-loving and swordmaster for what she believes that she was the one who killed her father, challenge after challenge she fights amount the remaining heads of the school's club until she hopefully earns her opportunity to fight Satsuki.\r\nThe story takes place in a post-dystopian, post-apocalyptic timeline was the poverty line is pushed to the extreme limits that your social life depends on the grades your kids get in their studies. And life was hard for Ryuko and her talkative friend, Mako, and her family.\r\nOf course, with a mad-max sitting like this one, you can't expect one to survive to bump mere fists, no, they have super clothing, and they rock might I add.\r\nRuko gets a black sailor's outfit that talks (?) and that of a free will, and he enemies are supplied with a strange line of clothing called the Goku outfits that are ranked from one start to three, the higher it gets, the stronger they are. Giving you super strength and speed as well as a Mecha screaming transformation.\r\nThe plotline twists on so many occasion, which only gets more satisfying and intense as it goes, hyping up characters and reveling new important faces.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nI still can't decide between Art or Sound perfection when talking Kill la Kill. Let's just say, they were crowned.\r\nThe show was released between 2013 and 2014, making it fairly old, but don't that lower your visual expectations for it, no, it stomps a good percentage of the modern dosses of seasonal Anime even now.\r\nNon-stop action requires a lot of frames, fluid translations, and storyboarding, and Kill la Kill did not disappoint in that department.\r\nThe character designs are crazy, sickly amazing and reflect on the direction of the show, very memorable in design and fun to look at even.\r\nI like that fights can span up to entire episodes and still suffer from minimal or even no drop in quality. There is a lot of impacts felt when blows are exchanged, you can feel the speed in the pacing of the animation, the anatomy can get super weird and whacky and so does the choreography, but Kill la Kill was never about realism, it's just fun and satisfying to watch a cartoony intense bloody fight between Animals.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nHere comes another star of the show, ever had an eargasm before? Then proceed with caution, this show might just take your ear-ginity.\r\nSeriously though, the soundtrack in this show is just phenomenal, and I'm specifically talking about the villain's OST, just perfect, it packs emotion, malice, arrogance, it just sounds so goodly evil, how on earth can they compose something so soundly good?\r\nThe openings and endings are matching the hype and goodness of the OST, both openings are to be remembered and the first ending was just so good, and when you hear it playing in the final episode, you just want to let ti go and let down some tears. Very powerful.\r\nThe voice acting was spot on, I especially loved Ryuko's voice, her edgy intense tone highlights the tom-boy part of her, man do I love it when she addresses \u201cKiryuin Satsuki\u201d with a voice that speaks anger and eagerness to fight. The rest of the cast was on part of the great quality of Ryuko's voice acting too.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nIt seems like even in the greatest shows, a solidly balanced cast of characters is always tricky and hard not to nit-pick on. Kill la Kill presents some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen, take for example Ryuko, a great protagonist that rarely pick up a nerve in you, the only thing I didn't like is her frequency emo-Esque phases that mostly ruin the already fun and good mood of certain moments.\r\nSatsuki in the other hand is amazingly written no matter the angle you're viewing her in. Great rival, solid character overall.\r\nMako is where it gets really mixed, there are people who love her, and people who just hate her gut, I seem to be okay with how she's written, she quibbles a lot, nags a lot, but most importantly, motivates and sticks up for Ryuko in all times, however, I still can't oversee her as a convenient plot device, especially in the earlier parts of the show where she's always a decoy to lure Ryuko into some trap.\r\nThe members of the Nudist Beach organization (Yes, that's a serious organization with a serious catch, it gets weirder) are all fun characters as well, and Mako's family just help lighten up the mood and tie up the Comedic effect of the show more.\r\nA very amazing character that makes her debut a bit later in the show is Ryago, an intense and sadistic antagonist that does so much good and nails every aspect that makes you both hate and love a villain, she has a great OST, the vicious voice acting and just enough abuse to deliver a solid villain in my opinion.\r\nThere was also this Nui girl that has a lot of fan following, but she didn't do it for me, so much for a crazy suicidal brat if anything.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI was not expecting anything of what I got back from Kill la Kill, if anything, it's a hilarious and fun journey to re-watch now and then, it just got everything you need to find a show enjoyable, probably the best asset in its disposable she the luck of taking itself seriously, I love it. The show reaches several climaxes with a great one just 3 episodes in, making it very easy to find your comfort zone with the show, if anything, I regret not watching in on its airing date where I would have been fanboying with the rest of the fandom every week, but it seems that the unfortunate amount of time that has passed ever since it finished airing, more people slept upon it, think it's just some weird  try-hard show.\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nKill la Kill might forever be one of the greatest classics from the 2010s, it's got a lot to praise, and very little to criticize. If you value fast-paced action, light-hearted comedy, and dramatic plot twists, it's just the show for you. But beware, it's just as weird as you might not give it credits for at first. And it only gets weirder from thereon. But weird isn't only bad, and bad is EA.\n"

With the intense battle between the heroes and the powerful Paranormal Liberation Front, it's no wonder why you would consider it the best season yet. The stakes are higher than ever before, and the fight scenes are as epic as ever. The animation and art style continue to impress, bringing to life the intense action and emotional moments of the story.\n\r\nThe character development in this season is also top-notch, with several characters facing tough choices and personal struggles. It's always great to see our favorite heroes grow and overcome obstacles, but it's equallysatisfying to see the villains get their time in the spotlight as well. Tomura Shigaraki and his cohorts are complex characters, and the way their stories unfold throughout the season is truly gripping.\n\r\nOf course, it wouldn't be My Hero Academia without the inspiring themes of heroism, friendship, and selflessness. The students of UA continue to learn important lessons about what it truly means to be a hero, and their growth is a joy to watch. The camaraderie between the students and their teachers is also heartwarming, providing moments of levity amidst the intense battles.\n\r\nThat being said, no season is perfect, and it's understandable that some viewers may have criticisms. Perhaps some characters didn't get as much screen time as you would have liked, or maybe there were certain plot points that felt rushed or underdeveloped. However, it sounds like the positives far outweighed the negatives for you, and you found this season to be a thrilling ride from start to finish.\n\r\nOverall: 8.7/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                This is a controversial one. Mostly famous by its questionable first episode content that dove straight away into gore and rape stripes it equaled an atomic bomb for social media, there wasn't anywhere in the Anime community that this show was being talked about.\r\n\u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d however, has a lot more to it than that, and the controversial rape scenes are not its only selling point, more were they intended to be viewed that way.\n\r\nStory: (8/10):\r\n\u201cGoblin Slayer \u201d is a show about a guy who slays Goblins.\r\nNo seriously, an armored guy who doesn't take off his helmet for some reason, obsessed by slaying Goblins for noat parent reason at first, but we find out more about his motives as the story progressed. As to not spoil any further details, I'm going to leave it at that for the story.\r\nWhat's really fascinating about \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d is its massive world that we don't get to see, but from all the different occurrences and conversation, we assume its huge size, much like what made \u201cOne Piece\u201d so great, you can feel that the Goblin Slayer isn't just some distended superhero who was prophesized from the beginning of time, he's not supposed to be someone important or somebody that's blessed by the Gods, he's one weirdo in the eyes of other adventurers and that's it. As the main story progresses, we get to hear about big events that changed the world around our main characters, for instance, news about defeating some demon lord is out, you really get to see how much important that was for the people and how it manages to affect the main storyline with no direct interactions.\n\r\nArt: (7/10):\r\nI kind of see where they were coming from, it really is hard to satisfy all the fans when it comes to the animation part, so people would prefer the exact style derived from the source material, some other want something new to the table, but at least all of them agree on one thing, that is, CGI is forbidden. And that's where we were hit the hardest.\r\nI'm not saying that they overused 3D composition, there were very minimalistic when it came to that, but it was worth noting at least.\r\nThe animation remains consistent to say the least throughout the run of the series. The art style is sharp and very Isekai-ish on the surface, it really captures the medieval vibes really well.\r\nI can confidently say that I've seen better takes on this type of art, and Goblin Slayer while doing a good job to provide a stable art of decent quality, that's by 2018 standards (almost 2019 now) is mediocre at best.\n\r\nSound: (9/10):\r\n\u201cChained onto me, my adolescent dream...\u201d, man, those lyrics are majestic, without a doubt, best opening of the season easily. Thanks to \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d, I managed to discover the music band \u201cMili\u201d, and for that, I'm very thankful.\r\nAs dark as the show is, the opening manages to capture that on the right track and the lyrics couldn't be more on point `Slay the last of your kind, to reclaim what's rightfully mine...\u201d, there are just a lot of great quotes to get from that.\r\nI wasn't a super big fan of the ending theme song though, but I get the tone behind it, it's not bad per se, it's good, but not on the same level as the opening theme song sadly.\r\nThe soundtracks were some of the finest, for a dark series as this, you'd really want so tracks with a classic vibe to them, something that encapsulates the darkness of medieval era really well, and we were not disappointed there, there are just a lot of amazing picks to go through.\r\nVoice acting was another beard cutter (Pun intended) here. A lot of great actors came along, you can Goblin Slayer's manly performance that really can tell a story of its own just by listening to the resonance of his voice, all the pain and hatred can be felt from listening to any conversation he makes.\r\nAnd now for my favorite, the supreme waifu that stands above all, her voice is the strongest point about her, voiced by none other than Hikasa Yoko, the same legend behind Rias Grimory from Highschool DxD and other more, I don't know how she did it, but that voice man, it's so enlightening.\n\r\nCharacter: (6.5/10):\r\nThere is really not much to it, and I wish they could have fleshed out the main characters at least, but given the short and at the same time massive content they managed to pack in 12 episodes, that can be semi-excused?\r\nGoblin Slayer for one, as the protagonist has been given a lot of spotlights, and it's only understandable, we get to find out about his backstory, and man is it intriguing, they gave us so little on him and yet if put into words, you feel like that was some tons of information all at once, but really, we're still in the dark in a lot of related things concerning him, and that's one character alone. If only they could have done the same to more characters, because \u201cGoblin Slayer\u201d (the series) does have a wide selection of truly interesting figures, and of course, it houses my all-time waifu, the great witch Majo, on man, I really can't get enough of hearing her delicate voice and her distinct pattern of speech, I can go all out fantasizing about all sort of stuff, but let's keep this review on track. I might just dedicate an appreciation session to her once a day from now on.\r\nOne really cool approach they went with as sort of leading the story on a third perspective view, that felt much like a first-person perspective, to be honest, and that's by giving the Goblin Slayer no obvious name, not only that, but his face has all the remaining mystery behind it, if at all, all we managed to see was the lower half of his face, it really made it seem as those MMO RPGs that put you to impersonate whatever character you want, again, it's not about the protagonist as an entity, but rather the story as a whole.\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10):\r\nOne thing for sure is, I never was big on Isekai and I only gave this a chance for all the hype it was given, and I can at least say that I wasn't disappointed. This was probably a trigger for me to go all out for other Isekai shows (Already loving Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken), it was an eye-opening experience that even put me in the spirit of reading the source material, and let me tell ya, I'm by no mean a Manga/Light novel fanatic.\r\nI'm sure as hell going to miss this series, and from what I've seen in the last bit of the last episode, a second season might just be upon us sooner than we might expect, let's just be hopeful.\n\r\nOverall: (7.9/10):\r\nThis show has changed my view on a lot of other series, not because it was some revolutionary pick or the first to do what it did, but that type of content, especially on this crappy PC age has kind of died out recently.\r\nIt was great to see something that gory and sexual that remains in the context of the story and that doesn't suck too much on the typical goofy Harem tropes that slowly start out giving you that Isekai vibe until it turns into a hardcore Icchi.\r\nGoblin Slayer was great, Goblin Slayer was really fun unless that is, you're easily triggered and or distributed by strong content, I wouldn't recommend it in that case, as it doesn't hold off one bit when it comes to that.\n"

That's exactly what this third season was for the entire series.\r\nI've uttered the expression \u201cThat's it?\u201d at the end of some of the seasons, but this one tries up the loose ends so well that when it wraps up and leaves nothing else to be desired. Of course, more season would be fantastic, but for what the first season set out to be, you can'task for a better conclusion of Kuroko's coming of age Basketball themed story.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nIn the previous season, the plotline always felt like it was focusing on every other side character of Generation of Miracle member while always having a blurred out focus on Kuroko despite him being the title of the series. I mean, he does seamlessly live up to be the phantom sixth even when his name is the first thing you see, but not anymore.\r\nA proper highlight has been given to Kuroko at last, to the point where it literally made him stand out more and somewhat give up on his lack of presence. We finally got to see the past of the Generation of Miracles in a canon context, how they started, and how they parted and what Kuroko was to his old team. At the end of the day, as the previous seasons gave resolution to different members of the Generation of Miracles, this one really went all out to flesh out both Kuroko and Akashi out.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nThe art and animation in this series only get better and better and sees no way of stopping. Even stills look very crisp and standout over the backgrounds that are, by the way, despite relying on CGI, they seem to blend in very well with the rest of the animation.\r\nThe highlights especially are absolute eye candy, it's not even fair anymore.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nAgain with the party banging openings and endings, I swear this show knows nothing but consistency, something a lot of similar shows never heard about.\r\nIt was in this season that I have started admiring the voice acting and talent shown, maybe it was the intensity of the finals and semi-finals what brought the real talent of the cast, screaming at the opponent at the top of your lungs while processing to give an emotional boost never ceases to get old if done this well.\n\r\n- Characters (8.6/10):\r\nWell, if anything, this was the season that really took the characters seriously. 90% of the complaints previously was how Kuroko and was never the center of focus, he never shows any growth, he's just there from season one episode one. But that's no more. And in contrast, Akashi's development really tells so much on the old and the new Generation of Miracles and how things escalated to the ways they are in the present timeline.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.3/10):\r\nIt seems I was afraid of nothing. After the meh season one and the amazing season two, I was in doubt of season three that it could fall off the grid, but I'm glad it didn't. The show follows the same sought intense Basketball games that, yeah, they do tend to drag out for 6 or more episodes, but in each and everyone big moment and highlights for the entire cast of characters, even for the ones sitting on the bench.\n\r\n- Overall (8.48/10):\r\nThis season solidifies the entire series as a solid and good standing show that tells a classic tale of growing up and never giving up. Friendship is a big theme also, and how severing your bonds can only lead to sadness and emptiness.\n"

Unfortunately, this movie tried pulling out a fast one on us, but it did not click at all, with more loose plot threads and too little setup that it felt like an elementary kids' fight.\r\nThe pacing was weird in this one,it started very dully and slow, to the point of falling asleep somewhere at the beginning of the movie, like watching a Naruto filler hell, but then towards the end it speeds up the flow of events so much so your attention gives up processing anything that happens, knocking you back into reality \u201cThis is just a filler Movie, why should I care?\u201d.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nDefinitely not the best I've seen from a Movie production, even back in the day. It just looks like a well-animated TV episode and nothing more.\r\nThe characters are well defined, they look sharper and clearer than the usual blurry treatment they get from a weekly episode. The particle effects were spot on, probably the only shine in this mediocre work.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nWhen starting a movie, or any high production entertainment product, you'd at least expect the delivery to be on par with what you get from the regular of said product. I like voice acting in Bleach, I love the OSTs, I adore the ambient sound effects. Thankfully, all of that was present, but unfortunately, nothing new came out of it. Again, following the same trend of a well-animated filler episode.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nWell, that was an unfortunate turn of events.\r\nIn every series, you have tat one character people put over the main characters, characters so cool they shatter that \u201cside character\u201d label and make it into countless fans' hearts, roll the dollars on merchandise, and even used to market their series at times, take into example \u201cKakashi, Levi, Law...\u201d, in Bleach's case, that's undoubtedly Toshiro.\r\nTo have a movie revolve around a fans' favorite is a clever way into marketing your series-related content that the fact it might backfire and just not work is staggering.\r\nThe main villain made complete nonsense, it was painfully apparent how Toshiro is forced to act the way he did like nothing from his showings in the main series mattered. The villain was a doll, unrelatable, and just another typical vengeful figure that somehow makes the entire Soul Society bond to fight the greater evil.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nThis is a definitive upgrade from the first movie, no doubt, But not by a lot.\r\nIt was definitely more encouraging to keep watch as all characters involved has had already been introduced properly and/or built-in relation to familiar characters, so not a lot of strange faces all introduced at once and you have to struggle and keep up with so many tongues rolling names.\r\nAgain, the premise of revenge story has been done so many times in a lot of different shapes and flavors that it's practically hard to pull anything new to the mix, but more Bleach is always okay with me.\n\r\nOverlay (7.16/10):\r\nAll in all, you're most likely not going to walk out of this movie mind blown, however, if you're looking for just another Bleach movie, this one has the best blend of fan service and filler crap that no one cares about.\n"

Yes, I indeed did, even more so on Sanji and Zoro's interactions, there differently should be canon episode on this, on the straw hats spending good times together, I enjoyed this more than I thought, and I absolutely love to see new shorts like this.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nWould I recommend this? It's certainly not for everyone, only your hardcore One Piece fans out there that really want to see more of their favorite crew members, It's not necessary at all to watch this prequel before watching the movie Film: Gold, or at all really.\n"

            "content": "\n                Now, I've never been that big fan of \u201cAngel Beats\u201d, but as the habit of watching everything, there is about a certain show once I've started it was never out of the box. Not to say I'm not a fan of \u201cMaeda Jun\u201d's work, the total difference, some of his works like Clannad is one of my all time favorites, but unfortunately, this series was everything but that.\n\r\n- Story (7/10):\r\nAs the title suggests. \u201cEpilogue\u201d, it's a secondary conclusion to the parent series that the knowledge of is not primarily required to get the \u201cfull\u201d Angel Beats experience as the show itself was more than enoughto deliver the message. It only provides an extra bonus (as the cool kids say these days) for anyone begging for more. And of the narrative it took, it really intrigued me to even go as far as rewatch the series again, maybe this time around I'd feel different about it.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nSame as I remember, only with the surprisingly consistent astounding background, I almost gave some spacing between my teeth, threatening to lower my jaw but surprised it just in time. The lighting, on the other hand, was a bit too, hmm, intense? I mean, I'm here to enjoy a story, not to get blinded for the sake of leisure.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nVery average performance, but then again, this was only a couple of minutes long and was never meant to go beyond a certain point.\r\nAt least nothing of vocal annoyance harvested, but it could have been better than this.\n\r\n- Characters (3/10):\r\nIt really was a shame. My biggest problem with the parent series was the large scale of the key character cast but the lack of their development other than just being there to fill up the crowd. A new face is briefly introduced, and only to cause confusion and give the protagonist a cheesy excuse to tease some lore about \u201cthe person he's waiting for\u201d.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nThat was really short but still had me on track with some bigger picture that might be clear at the end, but that was an illusion in on itself. I could have possibly had a blast if we got some good music records along to lighten up the mood, but no.\n\r\n- Overall (6.2/10):\r\nGiven the length of the animation, you'd think it would be an easy pick to get on. But consider the time you'd take to google the show and actually make it through the fullscreen max video settings as a setup for the experience, it really isn't worth it.\n"

            "content": "\n                The One Piece movies have built a notorious hit or miss reputation with a massive catalog of 14 movies (as of now), however, Strong World was a game-changer that led the One Piece movie experience from rare extinct DVDs to the big screens and cinemas, three high budget movies in a row, all highly praised for what they set up to be until Stampede came around and caused lots of debates in the fandom on whether it carried on the compassion from the three last movies or it failed to deliver an experience on the same specter of perfection and good ol' One Piece time.\n\r\nStory(7.5/10):\r\nThe storyline in Stampede is not the most captivating one, but it speaks so well to what One Piece is. It's an epic blood rushing adventure where pirates go head to head against each other trying to win a legendary treasure left by Gol D. Roger while the Marines are middling their way into the whole conflict. Basically, a free-for-all that manages to gather so many characters, some of which date to the very early arcs of One Piece.\r\nWhat really made this movie so story-lacking is the amount of screentime that was dedicated to telling the plot, instead, it was just a massive bar fight, all for one with punches and cannonballs coming from all directions which little to no coordination.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nStampede was probably the best One Piece ever looked for 2 hours straight, the art of the character faces and postures was just right, the filter they used on the Wano arc Anime and Broly movie is very present too which makes the colors stand out more rendering the backs a touch washed off. The fights were slick and fluid, very good choreographed with good camera angles that balance cinematography and storytelling through sheer camera shake and 3D hackery.\r\nThe only nitpick here that kept me from giving a higher score was the average CGI they used on Bullet's powers, it looked very out of place with the rest of the 2D environment and characters.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe movie did well with what it extended from the Anime OST and also the newly introduced track (Bullet's track) that added so much to the One Piece collection. The voice acting was good as well, nothing shy from the usual outstanding performance we get from the weekly TV show.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nThis would have been an easy 9 or even 10 had it not been for the bad villain. This being a celebration of the entire franchise, most of the characters introduced all over the years made several cameos if not even heavily involved with the plot itself, everyone from pirates, marines, revolutionaries, civilians that we know was shown which was and still is one of One Piece's best selling points, no one is forgotten.\r\nHowever, the new faces were not as fulfilling because the movie was supposed to be carried by them and the straw hats; but they failed to deliver, most of the blame falls on the amount of action which compiles a good 80% of the entire movie, which really ate a lot of time of what could have been dedicated to build up the villains and broadcast a more believable and heartfelt backstory, the same way Z from Film Z had.\r\nBullet felt more like a Dragonball character than a One Piece one, he was all bark and gains and no basis factor that drove the entire battle to be just another random UFC fight.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nMost of the fun and enjoyment came from seeing glimpses of past characters and references to early One Piece, seeing a lot of characters that you would never have thought would stand next to each other in a single frame, the different interactions and combo attacks, it truly was a celebration that spoiled us the fans with some of the best fanservice an Anime fan can wish for.\n\r\nOverall (8.2/10):\r\nThe movie was met with a lot of hype but unfortunately, it was far from delivering on what everyone was expecting, but despite that, the essence of One Piece was still present and strong which made it a sit-through with a lot of rewatchability. One of those movies that get better the more friends are watching along.\n"

It's one of those specials that I would have hated to sit through back when I had just finished watching the parent show, but 3 years later, I'm having a blast remembering every other twist that engulfed throughout the serialization of the show. I got to remember the characters I liked, the characters I hated, and the characters that I may have discarded as being doll and cheezy, but just realized how funny and likable they are. It's not a mandatory special bundle that one has to see in other to claim to have watched the entire series, but one that truly reminiscent with you, the further back you've finished watching the original series.\n"

Running my fingers across the keyboard, dramatically sliding my index from one side to the other while magically still type down a comprehensible sentence as my intense sweat evaporates into sparkles. Writing has never looked so intense before, such is the wonder of this majestic OST, and the latter is only a fragment from what the masterpiece called \u201cDeath Note\u201d can offer.\r\nIt's undeniable that the show at review is probably one of the founding pillars of mainstream Anime, it has almost becomea rule of thumb among the classics such as Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, and Trigun that every Anime fan should at least give a chance to. Those shows specifically always infiltrate discussions that goe about saying that older shows are the supreme, and the new Isekai/Shounen trashy guilty pleasure is what your typical \u201cnormie\u201d would be into. And that's a terrible form of gatekeeping.\n\r\nRecaps come in all shapes and forms, mostly ending up being horrendously bad and unfaithful to the original, but never have I seen better-executed processing of recapping in the Anime medium, that I was so eager to dive in as soon as it was ReWiNd TiMe.\r\nThe OST in death note is one of the best, and have not seen the show in ages, probably what approximate to 3 to 4 years now, it was a shame that it was beginning to fade away from my memory, so much so that hearing it again for the first time triggered massive nostalgia and thriller to being back again, and don't get me started on the phenomenal voice acting too, the characters are so much felt, those of a presence that tells a genuine story, carry strong emotion, and their fear of death resonates with even your own.\n\r\nFor some reason, the visual credibility of the original show had me in constant fear of there being a great deal of age, after all, I only got to experience it for the first time in probably crappy 480p, potato sound output and horrible latency. But now that I have managed to lay my fingers on this almost remaster-felt pie, I appreciated more the fact that it came from no other than the fantastic folks over at MadHouse, it really shows even with over a decade from it first being serialized.\n\r\nOne of the most controversial parts in the fandom is the fight over which the superior part of the series was best, the L arc, or L's successors' arc. I would personally go always for L's arc and this recap shows it clearly to me again. Both episodes were solid retrospective re-telling of the story, but the first one had me head over heels in awes.\r\nA total gem that's 100% worthy of many rewatches. Although it does not justify skipping over the parent show as you could only fit so much in a 3-something hours total of recap material.\n"

            "content": "\n                Overshadowed with the Shounen behemoth trio, Hunter x Hunter was never the series to get the attention and popularity it deserves, that is,  until the recent decade, where the much needed 2011 recut was released.\n\r\nEven to the outsider, Hunter x Hunter (2011) had quite the impression for a Shounen series, especially the long and mainstream ones that are known for receiving constant backlash from intoxicated fandoms and limit-crossing criticism. \u201cAh that show with over 900 episodes? I could never catch up with it now\u201d, \u201cThat show whose protagonist's ultimate trump card is a one-on-one talk with the villain? That does not sit quite rightwith me!\u201d, \u201cThat show where the power scaling makes no sense? Well, me watching it might as well make little as much sense\u201d. You hear them, you debate them (or not), these are the common complaints you'd hear from people who are being recommended any of the major players in the Shounen game, however, it goes entirely the other way when you specify the Anime at hand.\r\nHunter x Hunter seems like that show that has figured out the formula. Action-packed, dark-toned Shounen that spans a reasonable amoung of episodes, steaming with modern-day production values from what goes for its visual and vocal fidelity, adding to that the backing up of its source material that the fans love to swear by, that is a successful packaged deal that has been sought the moment the decisive business handshake was made.\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nWhen I think Shounen, I think the journey. The journey a young character has to go through in order to achieve a certain childhood dream, that is, the core definition in which by the majority of shows follow word by word, something that makes all of those shows almost look like a bootleg indie mobile game that's embarrassingly a reskin of a formula that works. The definitive template for your generic Shounen, if you will.\r\nA formula that works is an attraction for mass production, you've got a template, and you have an idea, just reskin the rest and you have a popular Shounen of a respectable fan base. Of course, the pillar of the genre are the ones who embrace the formula and introduce new takes to it, sometimes even altering the original blueprint by wich other shows in the future follow, and we've seen a lot of that from the likes of Dragon Ball and the Big Three.\r\nWith pride and compassion, Hunter X Hunter's identity as a Shounen couldn't be any less obvious, like a packaging print on the forehead, the likes you'd see behind agent 47's neck (from the Hitman series), and unfortunately, just like the latter, gets by unnoticed. With a defining linear timeline, it clunches to the goal it sets by at the beginning of the series and work its way through several interconnected arcs until it hits the sought out deadline, and then expands on the vast, mysterious world it takes place in.\n\r\nA weird and enticing flavor that the 2011 recut has going for it, that none of the highly glorified Shounen kings shares, is the snappy and swift progression, never feels so draw up when you look at it, episodes fly by so fast and still reveal on so much intel that would take your typical Shounen show several episodes to fill in the gaps. With an invisible amount of two filler episodes (Just two recap filler episodes to be more specific, episode13 and episode 26), it puts the majority of other shows to shame, not only with the canon material reign but also, just the rightly paced plot progression, you never spot a drawn-out, time buying nonsense that does not contribute to the development of the story in any way.\r\nA Shounen specific plague the Coronime (a play on Covonavirus) that's popular among the genre and a personal annoyance of mine is the unwanted fan service inserts that jump you off randomly, sometimes on some of the most important moments, ending up ruining any kind of build-up that would make you care, Hunter X Hunter just doesn't have that, its very blueprint doesn't have that in it, I would sit here and try to come up with a scenario of it, and I would never be able to. It's just that good and interesting that it never swelled by the Ecchi plugs in favor of its story, basically, it has re-defined what fan service is.  A WELL CONSIDERED DIRECTION. But minimum to none has followed on its steps.\n\r\nA weird, but interesting pattern I've grown to notice in the linearity of the plot, although quite repetitive (but still varies), is the heavy game structured arcs, or what makes the most out of an arc. Basically, seeing past the subjective structure of events, you find that most of the situations at hand are walled into a competitive game between two parties or several, all focused on the prize which is usually linked to Gon's endgame goal; finding his father.\r\nThe first arc \u201cThe hunter exam\u201d is purely strategic, endurance battle royal, a wrenching race against time and stamina disguised behind the name of \u201cselection exam\u201d and then after, following the same premise, \u201cHeaven's Arena\u201d. This dedication to the game theory goes as far as being the foundation of one of the major arcs, \u201cGreed Island\u201d; a full-on simulation card game that builds itself atop of the real world; and then there is the massively emotional obsession of board and mind games between certain characters in \u201cChimera Ant\u201d arc, a psychic look at how a game can play one's mind, doubting one's superiority and changing them for the better or worse.\n\r\nGon's quest to finding Ging is an event that's been teased up almost every single episode, being the main focus of Gon and the series, episode by episode and step by step, the goal is closer than ever by the end of each episode, making you feel the advancement of their journey as the fast pace shows really well in this perspective.\r\nRight at the finish line, when the big reveal is up, there is a certain fill of satisfaction, but also a deep disappointment that accumulated after building up your expectations to a degree that the show was never wanting to deliver on. Don't have high hopes folks, and just get by what the show throws at you, as it's filling in its rightful way.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nYou ever sit down and wonder if your favorite show could get the FMB:A treatment, this analogy has been used so much that it pretty much became a common expression to hear all the time. The 2011 recut for Hunter x Hunter was just that, and for an amazing show, to begin with, it meant everything to the fans of the original.\r\nEven in 2019/2020, the overall visual quality is still appreciated, breathing of talent and consistency, putting some seasonal shows to shame even.\r\nFor some people, saying that the studio behind this recut is none other than the fantastic folks at Madhouse, they have been regarded as one of the bearers of the holy crown in the industry for the quality shows they produce (align side Trigger, Kyoto Animation, Bones, etc...), and Hunter x Hunter was yet another nail hammered right in its place.\r\nIf I had to nominate a visual aspect to receive the attributed trophy in the stead of anything else visual, it would be the character designs, especially after you come from the 1998 original, the difference is staggering, you can make out which character's which, but the improvement that you even never asked for are there, and are much welcomed, they don't feel dated or dragging, finding every excuse for the visual perfectionist in Anime to keep watching.\r\nThe only nitpick I would probably not overlook is the \u201clazy\u201d animation and lackluster of fluid transitive choreography. It seems that Madhouse has set up a high ceiling for what you'd expect from both a third party studio and itself, that the expectations are always at the upmost of their height that you can't help but get bugged at every slippery pixel out of place. Aside from a handful of really good, directly cinematography wonders, the rest of the action feels very unmotivated on a visual note, as I said, there are some fantastic displays of animation that really speak Madhouse's name and echoes it back and forth, but some other shots++ really look like a tightly budgeted J.C Staff production that must have slipped away from a wrong internship insert.\n\r\nSound (9.2/10):\r\n\u201cIf it's working, don't fix it\u201d. As a programmer myself, that is a motto I live by, and it is also the motto this show regards its opening theme song by. The vocal capability alone is superbly enchanting you into each episode, inviting you in, calming you down, preparing you for what's in store. The visuals seem to change during every arc, showing relatable imagery to the story arc it spans over leaving the vocal as familiar as it was in the very first episode, it's a formula that works, as long as the song is a total party banger, which it is in this case.\r\nA spare of clean clothing every now and then is nice, and so is a change to a reoccurring pattern. The opening is excused for how good it is, but the ending theme songs don't quite scale up nicely, that is, until the story arc in-frame changes tones. We are treated with a collection of amazing ending theme songs, almost every arc or midway, reflecting on every shred of emotion that the episode closes on.\r\nA big part of my experience with Hunter x Hunter (2011) was the excellent selection of voice actors and actresses. Never an overly loud, ear scratching amateur. Gon's and Killiua's voice actors do deliver on such a great spectacle, those squicky high-noted voices fit perfectly with their physical portrayal, they do play emotions and intensity nicely and carry on the script at hand, making for believable and relatable plays.\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\r\nLong-running shows have a tendency to feature lovable characters or in some cases, make you think it does. Being stuck with the same cast of characters along 3 number digits episodes makes you accept them and get used to seeing them that suddenly stopping watching bring feelings of emptiness.\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) embraces all of that, only that it highlights its key characters so well that even after the very first episodes you're left astonished at how deeply attached you've grown with the majority of characters.\r\nGon Freecss is a very interesting specimen. The general trope that a basic Shounen takes for granted is to feature a goofy character that has sacrificed half of his or her brain cells in favor of some promised powerups and shares in the plot armor, but not with this wholesome, go-lucky boy. Gon is a self-described prodigy, one that thinks before acting, observes and dissects the situation with a mature tone that lifts him up even among his age-demographic peers.\r\nThe progressively linear flow of the story makes sure it does its protagonist justice, it is guaranteed for him to shine during every single arc, one way or another, from impressing the witnesses and even himself in his raw physical power, to getting thrown at the darkest, most sickeningly depressing phases that would easily overstressed the sanest person around. He is one and before all, a caring, extremely loving, loyal friend that always brings joy and happiness around wherever he goes, standing as a light of hope for many characters that primarily includes his close friends; Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio.\r\nAs a Shounen, and a definitive classic at that, you've gotta have a rival or a character of similar status that accompanies the protagonist on whatever quest he or she is on, and for the most of the series, Killua is all of that. From the very first arc, Killua is as important and as focused on as Gon is, and on some arc even more that it makes you question the protagonist label on Gon sometimes. Really, Hunter x Hunter, both the original and the recut do a fantastic job in separating the plot and characters; meaning that bearing the protagonist label isn't necessarily the focus of the show, but rather, just a vehicle for us to explore the much, more rich and extensive world.\r\nTaking a step back, the duo Gon and Killua feel like each other's cameraman, when Gon is going through hard times, it is Killua that takes on the spotlight, narrates what he has in mind, works up solutions for his friend's problems and acts as the definitive bridge between us the viewers and the crossed over universe in the screen and it is as apparent with Gon and it is with Killua, a classic story of getting your buddy's back.\r\nSomething that I've always found very unique to One Piece is the reoccurring returns of past characters that never cease to be irrelevant, no matter the time frame or the arc's setting, Hunter x Hunter opened my eyes and had me consider other shows to have the same quality in that regard. Not only a few but a lot of faces are being referenced every now and then, starting from the very familiar Kurapika and Leorio to the numerous occasional sightings of the members of the phantom troupes.\r\nI found it funny how the longest and probably the most popular arc of the series has a huge theme of individuality going on, just how every other character, important or not is, very individual and unique that it stands up no matter how overshadowed it is. Kurapika for instance, tells a story of his own, very independent than anything else going on, but still, partially relates to the overarching story, and Leorio... Leorio is one that you don't see very often. He was a meh kind of character from the moment he was introduced until he puffs away along with Kurapika, and as you think you'll probably never see him he gets back to the scene at the very last episodes and showing off why he IS a proud Hunter x Hunter character, from 0 to 100, he is one of my favorite characters in the show and has done so anonymous like a slap to my face.\r\nA specific character to me was very intriguing, very provoking to the idea of considering watching the show in the first place, that would be Hisoka. I grew up with the 1998 show, however, my memory was still very fuzzy about it, aside from the names Gon, Killua, Kurapika (or Kurabika as I thought it was at the time) and Hisoka. Even now, he is the very confusing and complex persona I always thought he was, he is like no other in the show, vibing in a creepy pedophilic way that throws one-off, but his charismatic interaction with the rest of the cast makes up for it, the dramatic flavoring was strong with that one.\r\nReally, the star of this show lives in its characters, staring so many iconic and lovable personas from what goes from protagonists to heroes, so unique and thought-provoking ideologies that put the majority of your typical Shounen villains to shame.\r\nIt is so satisfying to grow loving every decision the characters make that help shape their treats later, a true development to their values like watching a baby grow up into a healthy functioning decent human being. The Chimera Ant arc for example expanded on a very underrated aspect of any Shounen, that is breaking through the core of a character, past the Shounen norm and diving into their physiology and what makes them partake the label \u201cVillain\u201d or \u201dHero\u201d. Meruem, for example, takes his first step out of his mother's womb engulfed in a very bigotted, arrogance superiority complex, self-proclaiming to be the one and absolute king into a humble lost son of life's cause, after seeing the bigger picture of natural selection, it is not the sorted out pure genes that puts on your the highest position of the chain, but it is something else that makes an arrogant king humbler than a broke 3 digits years old farmer living in the boonies.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10):\r\nI love my Shounen, sometimes, maybe too much, but the majority of Shounen bandwagon I jump on end up very generic and confirming for the genre's trope-y run. However, once in a blue moon, I come across a series that changes my perspective on the genre and reminds me of why I'm this into Shounen series, the search for the core ingredient of what makes a Shounen really good, it's not the goofy main character, it's not the fights, nor is it the turnouts. It's the whole package.\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) reaffirms a lot on its genre, featuring fights that keep you begging for more and character development that has you revise your character rankings all the time, it pushes the hype, and never seems to slow down, that objectively, not a single arc was any lower than pure greatness.\r\nIt has been a while since I could bear to sit through more than 3 episodes of the same show back to back, yes, I would binge a whole 30 episodes back when I first started watching Anime, but then again, I was a free boy during a long summer break, but now that I've got my hands full all the time, three episodes is quite the achievement for me to realize that I'm digging a show, but pushing even further (Which Hunter x Hunter (2011) had me do throughout the run) means that I'm really into what I'm watching, that was me during the Soul Society arc (Bleach), further, a year later, I get to live the same long-sought hype craving with Hunter x Hunter 2011, but this time, not during a single arc, but the entire show. Crazy.\n\r\nOverall (9.24/10):\r\nOne Piece, Naruto, and Bleach might not resonate for all, seeing how long and kind of old they are, but Hunter x Hunter 2011 comes with a lot to offer that it leaves no excuses for not being watched, it is a pleasing magnet. Not so many shows can fast forward you from the first episode straight to the last without even realizing the time spent watching, so immersive and intense, it discards the tiniest drop of boredom, no yawns throughout, or at least, none that you can feel to keep a count of, the anxiety and risks the characters are taking are so well delivered that you yourself get dragged into the overarching drama, forcing you to sob along, and cheer when needed.\n"

Other than that, walk the other way.\n\r\nThese were some unnecessarily hard shorts to find, for the number of years (I'm kidding you NOT, more than two years) spent looking for these, the hassle is really not close to being worth it, however, now that the Blue-Ray volumes have been fully released, the shorts were made available easily on streaming platforms and even on Youtube.\n"

            "content": "\n                Shounen shows are definitely a defining genre in the medium, it's in the name really, a teenage protagonist aiming to achieve a specific goal along with the common harem element trope, maybe add to that an incompatible rival to keep things interesting and you've got yourself a starter plot that feeds from the Shounen trope by the roots. However, once a few years comes the deal breaker, that one Shounen that claims the genre in its name, but tackles things differently that one can easily mistake it for a more mature toned series that would best fit the Seinen criteria. Enter, Shounen Jump's highly praisedtitle, \u201cYakusoku no Neverland\u201d, or \u201cThe promised Neverland\u201d as a direct translation.\n\n\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nHaving lived every day as perfect and full of smiles as ever, eating healthy meals and playing tag on a lovely green field. Just when they least expected it, the kids at this charming and happy orphanage come into the realization that flipped their lives upside down like they never expected before, their fragile mentality naturally rampaged into devastating cries but before long, their instinct of survival awakened, and it was time for the longest game of tag in the history where winning is the only way to survival.\n\r\nProbably what kills a good adaptation is the factor of time, that fear of catching up to the source material haunts the people involved in a production level more than anyone making them steep so low to utilize stalling techniques from what ranges from filler content to dragging scenes more than they should, all as a strategic move that benefits the franchise in a business level. Being a seasonal Anime alone speaks of its quality, and that's not even referencing the studio behind it, Bones has delivered some of the greatest adaptations and \u201cThe promised Neverland\u201d is no exception.\r\nWith as much crapped up content as a seasonal production allows, fast yet cautious pacing really helps speed up through only what matters making you never yawn in boredom.\n\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nIf there was anything this adaptation does exceptionally more than anything else, is the camera positioning, no kidding, the cinematography team must have been filled with world-class talented individuals, you could have never thought how a simple movement from a camera can enhance even a still image and build suspense in unimaginable ways.\n\r\nThe art style one everything but familiar, and you can take that any way you want, but a change is never immediately bad. The character's facial features surely are odd and can be uncanny to some, having all of their features extremely centered in their face, pointy noses and neighboring eyes, well, it's animations, and an artist can take all the freedom in his or her canvas.\n\r\nOne other thing that a lot of shows lack is consistency in delivering the same visual quality, something that's very easy to slack up on. The love people put in their work is apparent, and this was no different.\n\n\r\nSound (9.5/10):\r\nVoice acting is key.\r\nIn a show that's this heavy on drama, a single syllable off can ruin an important performance, making the audience feel bad for a character can be regarded as a form of talent, it is no easy task to decide if someone should be crying or having a watery eye simply by utilizing your voice in such a way that provokes the tears, that's a magical power that we tend to sleep on usually.\r\nThe voice acting cast is a solid one, nailing every emotional scene be it in favor of sadness or joy, their tone can move you like an unworldly spell.\n\r\nLet's talk opening and ending sequence. They have already secured a definitive spot on those popular Youtube Anime songs quizzes, maybe even on a few fans' playlists, I know I got them in there.\n\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI'm not going to praise \u201cYakusoku no Neverland\u201d all that much on this one, it's got a good selection of interesting characters, and that's that.\r\nI can appreciate a well-written character that doesn't fall under your typical trashy tropes the like of a stupid big-breasted chick or a smart loli first-grader otaku head, all of the characters are portrayed in a realistic manner that makes it easier to relate to.\r\nBeing the orphanage it takes place at, it's bound to flood you with all sorts of characters that give you a hard time to remember all of their names and matching faces, but that was not the case here, they all get their respective highlights were they got some spotlights to shine unlike most of other Shounen.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThis season had some great shows that keep you begging for the next episode, so it's hard to honestly measure the hype related to this specific show but it's there. A lot of fans of the Manga praised this adaptation and what it had coming and they were right.\r\nThe cliff hangers were crazy, the build-up on every episode was almost flawless and involving, there was a great room for theorizing and feeding the community back of whatever chunk of lore you've managed to knit a theory out of.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nIs it a recommendation? Well, is that even a question, most definitely it is. I don't care if you're not on good terms with Shounen Anime, this could be the change you sought for so long, it's so different from other Shounen that it might fool you to think otherwise.\r\nI can already estimate the massive amount of fans jumping straight to reading the Manga for how excited they are to know more, and I could be on the same horde. That's just how good \u201cYakusoku no Neverland\u201d was, and you bet your boy is going to suck on the second season as well.\n"

            "content": "\n                There's plain stupidly clueless, and there is FLCL clueless, those two very different sides of the same coin called cluelessness become very distinguishable when one first experiences FLCL and gets to enjoy it, but not necessarily fully understand the meaning behind it. That was probably the biggest aspect that made the original FLCL the loved piece of work that we've come to know. Although called a sequel, \u201cFLCL Progressive\u201d is a yet blunt and abstract on the surface piece of art made by kindergarten children that you'd expect from the hipsters of the era who have no sense of fashion (ironic) to call a revolutionarymasterpiece, although it has nothing to do with the original OVA, and focuses entirely on its own made up story, with new characters, new direction, and a new premise. The majority of the fans preferred FLCL to remain the lone wolf it always was, probably that what made it unique. Many hardcore fans fared the arrival of this period, but what happened had already happened, and all that's left for them to do is let out a gloomy sigh and give this unwanted stranger a chance, maybe, just maybe it turns out to be the sequel we all didn't want, but never knew we needed. However, does it do the series any favor by existing? \n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\r\nMuch like the original, on the surface, not a single faint sense of story can be picked up, at least not that easily. They for some reason decided to skip the introduction of the town the events take place at, from the context of it all, it was probably set at the same place as the original, I don't know if it was intended from the viewers to get it themselves, either way, is it an up or a down is debatable. Unlike the original where we had a huge focus on Takkun the whole time, while the remaining time we get to see about other minor characters, this sequel decided that it was a bad way to do things and thus presented 2 potential main characters. On one side you have a girl, 14 years old Hidomi Hibajiri, the typical depressed teenager that does in her daily routine nothing outside of waking up and going to school, sometimes working part-timely in her family coffee shop run by her mother, very boring life. On the other hand, there's Ko Ide, a go-lucky dude looking like a main-side-character hybrid in attire. Both immatures get caught up in some serialization of events caused by the familiar Haruko Haruhara and the new figure from the same race, Julia Jinyu.\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, both teens are cursed by the fate of having inter-galactic robots coming out of their foreheads, not only that but many other characters as well, which makes it less special of an ability than we are familiar with.\r\nThe humor was just a NO, predictable jokes with pretty much dead humor. The pace wasn't as fast as the original, and you'd think it would be a good thing, but the original still managed to do things better than this sequels despite the speed gap.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nFLCL has always proven itself to be outside of the visual borders of the traditional Anime, so whacky at times and yet so creative, very diverse and alive, the alteration of the colors and camera angles to even completely flip a switch on the art style portrayed. However, seeing a 2018 production pale in comparison with a production from 2000 is just utter nonsense, absolutely unforgivable and disappointing. Not to say that overall the quality was horrible, but the fact that it was unfaithful to what made the original so big is such a turnoff.\r\nYou could really sense their desperation to recreate FLCL but in a more modern art style standards, turned out to be non-fitting at all, like reliving the nightmares of the new Teen Titans and Power Puff Girls shows, and we all know how that ended, makes you wonder if they learned any lesson from that. They even went as far as trying to adopt the same animation concept but in a different direction, like remember the classic fast-paced manga panel scene from the first episode of the original? I think I just witnessed an act of murder in its case. Also, the very low FPS rate on some of the most important battles that were supposed to be fluid and dynamic was completely unsatisfying, feeling like staring at a footage of a painted wall drying at 8 FPS. All that was left is the nostalgic vibes of the aesthetic scenarios from the original, there was nothing of that sort in this. I would at best get 3 or 4 wallpaper material screenshots from the entire 6 episodes while compared to the two number digits I can get from a single episode of the original.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nMusic played a huge role in making the original series as memorable as it was, big thanks to the Pillows for that. And fortunately enough, we got them back in this sequel too with some of the reused tracks from the original that added a sense of nostalgia to the show, that was very appreciated. I remember watching the subbed version on my first experience, and it was phenomenal, I never got near the dubbed territory and I never enjoyed it in FLCL at least (I still prefer some dubs over subs though), but one issue I had with this is the non-existence of a subbed version, yes that's right, being an Adult Swim original it came only dubbed and we may never live to see a subbed version in the works. For all that matter, I really hated it, for the most part, especially Haruko's performance, it was super cringy, uncomfortable and hard to take in context. I was okay with other voice actors though, Julia's, Ko's and Hidomi's were superb at what they did. The soundtracks were above average and so were the sound effects used making you feel home but not to the degree of the original.\n\r\n- Character (4.0/10):\r\nIt would seem that FLCL Progressive would be this revolutionary step up from the original seeing how it had a huge ego just because it decided to come up with the original idea of having more than one main character, but it ended up barking with more than it could deliver upon. While Hidomi was on some level, a solid FLCL protagonist material, looking like the main character for a change, and having a motive about her depression, Ko, on the other hand, was just there to fill up a spot that we expected way more from. Looking at his design, he doesn't look like the main character, probably just a bit that you are guaranteed to mistake him for a non-protagonist if you were to put him among background crowd. I understand that design doesn't define a good character, and with this, we move to their reasoning about choosing him to be a main despite all of that. Throughout the 6 episodes, we never got anything backing this guy out, I guess he exists solely for the purpose of being a trigger for Hidomi to act heroically.\r\nNow to the most controversial part, Haruko Haruhara, this was what set me off. It was like introducing a completely near-perfect replica of her, having the same voice and wearing the same skin, but it was still surrounded by an aura screaming this is a stranger. Yes, she had always been unpredictable, random, as abstract as a classic painting by Picasso, but it seems as if the creators forgot how to reproduce what they once perfected.\r\nBehind all of this mess was a shiny gem of a character, Julia Jinyu, an extraterrestrial related to Haruko that takes the side of the main characters acting like a mix between Canti and Haruko. Very lively and vibrant design refreshing to the eye, totally something worthy of the original. The rest of the cast resides in Hidomi's mother, very one-dimensional character that didn't offer much, and some classmates of the main duo, which by the way acted like a complete waste of potential.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6.0/10):\r\nI was very skeptical at the very beginning about watching this, but no matter how long I avoided it I knew I would someday watch it. It was all in means of experiencing something new about FLCL but I was never more wrong. In terms of FLCL vibes, there were none. I remember it to be a show with a special layer of depth that made it look very depressing and gloomy, kind of the GTA IV is on consoles, covered in a blue filter that makes New York feel like the opposite of what you'd call liberty city.\r\nI enjoyed some characters, for instance, I rooted for Hidomi and Ko all the way, there was this fat guy who was desperate about getting this loli girlfriend, and it was a sight worth seeing. I don't know if the one chuckle I cracked during watching this is worthy of making the show humorous, but a diamond under countless trash doesn't make the garbage a diamond mine.\n\r\n- Overall (6.0/10):\r\nFor those people who really want to re-experience FLCL anew, I highly recommend rewatching the original instead of diving into this strange territory of disappointment, that is, if you were expecting this to offer the same things. With that said, if you're open-minded, and watch to see something new that's not entirely FLCL-ish, you might get something out of this. Although it's not going to be of the same depth mind you.\r\nAnd for those people who for some reason want to skip the original FLCL and watch this as a means of guidance into the universe of FLCL than just don't, this installment is the wrong place to start, as it can be described as everything but FLCL.\n"

            "content": "\n                I'm as strange to Asian culture as the next weeb, on my first watch of the movie, I did wonder and question several directory decisions but until I read some reviews and schemed over some snippets from the movie I finally started grasping the genius behind what some would call, a poor man Shinkai's movie.\n\r\nThe movie goes scrolls through an anthology consisting of the transition into adulthood from several points of view, almost like an autobiography that narrates itself.\n\r\nThe first story titled \u201cSunny Breakfast\u201d mirrors Xiao Ming, a young adult who reminisces on his life decisions as he desperately searches for the perfect bowl ofnoodles that's yet to remind him with his long lost tasteful youth. On many occurrences, the steam escaping his hot and fresh bowl of noodles foggs everything else starting from his childhood crush, everyday struggles in life between chores and school highlighting his grandmother's love for him. A bowl of noodles that not only encapsulates his childhood memories that seem to have faded out and lost its taste with the passing years but also represents his unconditional love and connection with his sickly aging grandmother.\n\r\nCompared to the two other stories, \u201cA Little Fashion Show\u201d was sandwiched too tightly that it couldn't be expressed freely in the given time and widely different vibe of the other two stories.\r\nWhile the two other stories have somewhat of a similar setting to them, with both parties coming from rough, poor to below-average living conditions, this one flashes all the broadway lights at one of the top lifestyles between fame and wealth.\r\nAlthough the vibe in this one might not be as captivating and as relatable to others, the meat o the story resides on the relationship of two sisters as weight on a famous fashion icon obscures a lot of their desires to share love and prosper. Two individuals where one has talent but no front to make it whilst the other is the complete opposite but with so much success that it starts eating away at her ego and degrading her self-esteem and confidence.\n\r\nThe movie concludes with the third and last story named \u201cShanghai Love\u201d, a young sparkling beginning to an innocent love that gets lost between the stubbornness and determination from both parties.\r\nIt was because of this particular peek into two childhood friends that made people call out Shikioriori as a 5-Centimeters Per Seconds rip-off, some even calling its second coming or its redemption, but the romance element was the least captivating thing about it for me, instead, the display of parenting was the real hook.\r\nBoth Limo and Yu grow up in similar circumstances only for one of them to have been born into an intolerant parent that would turn to violence as a show of his parenting, an entire night of taking a beating, and then in the morning no tears to be shed but the grave marks left all over the face and the body. A harrowing reminder of how things went in people's daily lives and everybody still acted as nothing happened.\n\r\nSome call Shikioriori an unoriented narrative that doesn't know where it's going but in my eyes, the tripartite bit-sized look into the characters it presented was what made the best of it. The real seller for me was the last scene where all parties were revealed to have been present in the same waiting area in some airport, waiting for the next flight in anticipation, revealing that no matter how far and unrelated they were, their stories managed to intersect at some point uniting all of these different people while they reminisce on their lives up until that point before they go their separate ways until another unfated encounter.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nEnjoyment (8.7/10):\r\nOverall (8.44/10):\n"

Yeah, it had spectacular animation and sound design, the pacing was amazing and the characters were lovable, but my experience with it in a weekly fashion took a big tollon my enjoyment of the show. Long story short, until I do a proper binge-rewatch, excuse my saltiness.\n\r\nWith that said, watching this movie as soon as possible was the best thing I could do to drag me back to the whole Jujutsu Kaisen fan bubble.\n\r\nThis movie is a prequel that focuses on an entirely different character, Yuta, a name that's been referenced in the Anime but with not much detail, but this movie leaves you wanting more of this magnificent character. Weirdly enough, and even more than Itadori, Yuta really feels like the legitimate protagonist of this universe, everything from his design to philosophy screams of main character energy.\r\nA huge plus was how the movie put some spotlight on currently established characters, and with what we know right now, it really helped the experience of seeing a slightly past version of what they were like, as well as tie in some narrative knots that were left unclean in the Anime.\n\r\nNormally, I wouldn't advocate too much for a movie, however, if not for anything, the animation alone is good of a reason to watch this movie in the highest quality possible. You'll see me bloat on how breathtaking Demon Slayer's entertainment arc animation was, but when it came to it, this movie had me suffer from jaw problems for the next two days. It was truly a fan service extravaganza for Sakuga lovers of all shapes and magnitudes.\n\r\nOverall: (9/10).\n"

            "content": "\n                Oh, let's talk about Mashle, the oddball of the anime world. Now, I must confess, I was already a fan of the manga before the anime adaptation was even a glimmer in the industry's eye. So, when the announcement came, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of underwhelm. I mean, let's be real, we've all seen our fair share of filler-filled seasons, and I feared that Mashle would just be another forgettable addition to the lineup. But boy, oh boy, was I pleasantly surprised.\n\r\nThe animation, well, let's just say it didn't blow me away. It falls into the category of \"mediocre at best.\" Butyou know what? That didn't even matter because the dry humor of Mashle is like a magic spell that makes everything ten times funnier. It's like a secret ingredient that turns a simple dish into a gourmet feast. Sure, the characters may initially appear a tad bland, but upon closer inspection, they reveal a delightful depth that keeps you entertained. Their dynamics are a rollercoaster of absurdity and fun, and you can't help but root for them on their quirky adventures.\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the voice acting. It's not exactly worthy of a standing ovation, but it's also not something to bash mercilessly. It falls comfortably in that middle ground where it gets the job done without making your ears cringe. But oh, let's not forget about the real showstopper: the OST. This studio, my friends, had some serious guts to create an OST that is so ridiculously brave and, dare I say, absurd. Picture this: you're casually watching the show, and suddenly, a rap trap starts blasting in the background as something completely insignificant happens on the screen. It's unexpected, it's bizarre, and it gets a chuckle out of me every single time. It's like the cherry on top of this delightfully peculiar sundae.\n\r\nAnd we can't wrap up this review without talking about the Opening and Ending. I dare say they are some of the best of the season. They capture the essence of Mashle perfectly, with catchy tunes and visuals that make you want to groove along. They set the tone for the show and leave you eagerly anticipating each new episode.\n\r\nSo, in the end, Mashle is an anime that defies expectations. It may not have the flashiest animation or the most polished voice acting, but it compensates with its dry humor, entertaining characters, and a ridiculously brave OST. It's like that quirky friend who may not fit the mold, but brings a breath of fresh air to your life. So, grab a bowl of popcorn, sit back, and let Mashle take you on a wild and unexpectedly hilarious ride.\n"

            "content": "\n                When it comes to the world of Anime music, there's always a lot of expectations riding on the songs that accompany each series. So when Shinsei Kammattechan's \"Boku no Sensou\" was announced as the opening theme for \"Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season\", fans were beyond excited to hear what this song had in store for us. But unfortunately, it seems that this full version of the song fell flat, failing to live up to the hype that had surrounded it.\n\r\nIt's a common misconception that more is always better. But when it comes to music, it's all about how the pieces fit together. And inthe case of \"Boku no Sensou\", the longer version just doesn't seem to work. The buildup is slow and lacks any real impact, and the chorus just doesn't hit as hard as it should. It's almost as if the song was meant to be just a minute-long snippet to get fans pumped up, but then they decided to expand it into a full-length song. And what was once an explosive intro, now feels like a damp squib.\n\r\nIn a way, it's a shame that \"Boku no Sensou\" turned out this way, because the visuals for the music video were pretty imaginative. But when the visuals are the best part of the song, it just goes to show how much the song itself is lacking. It's a rare occurrence when the full version of an Anime song is worse than the cropped version, but unfortunately that's the case with \"Boku no Sensou\". The song just feels like it's missing something that could have taken it from average to amazing.\n"

It's a true masterpiece of laziness and mediocrity, let me tell you. \n\r\nSo, here's the deal. You know those recap episodes that anime studios love to shove down our throats? Well, this one takes it to a whole new level. It's not just a regular recap, oh no. It's a copy-paste extravaganza! They literally took scenes from the previous six episodes and slapped them together like a hastily made collage. Bravo, guys. Bravo.\n\r\nNow, I don't know about you, but when I see a special episode, Iexpect something... special. You know, like new content, a fresh perspective, or maybe even a hilarious behind-the-scenes look at the making of the show. But no, all we get is a recycled highlight reel. How exciting! It's like rewatching the episodes we've already seen, but without the thrill of anticipation. Talk about a major letdown.\n\r\nI can't help but wonder what the animators were thinking. Did they just run out of ideas after six whole episodes? Did they need a break? Well, let me tell you, if they needed a break, they could have just taken one. I would have been perfectly fine with waiting for a real new episode instead of this recycled nonsense. But hey, who needs original content when you can just copy and paste, right?\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the timing of this masterpiece. We're only six episodes into the series, folks. Six! It's not like we needed a recap to refresh our memories or anything. I'm pretty sure most of us can still remember what happened in the last few weeks. But hey, I guess the studio thought we needed a refresher because the story of Mashle is just so complex and mind-boggling. Give me a break.\n"

I don't know if that's an unpopular opinion or I'm just too much of a Shounen struck to know better, but it is what it is.\n\r\nThis show established itself as one of the most bizarre and weird Anime experiences I had the pleasure of enjoying, it's ridiculous and takes itself lightly, never too serious and desperate and that's what was the most fun. You'd think a show about martialarts would get stale and boring by the end of the first episode, after all, there is only so much you can do with throwing fists in the same direction only at different targets, but no, you're still missing out on the crack version of it all, that is, the acid trip known as Baki.\n\r\nThis show was a festival in spirit, with so many characters and so many names that you end up somehow resonating and remembering for the long run, better yet, the exchange of blows strangely makes them relatable and better to understand, they say you never know how hard a wall is until you throw your punch at it and this was all true with the character arch types in this series.\n\r\nBaki as a character feels like a greater than life, loud dreamer on a non-ending chase for greatness, or at least, his 13 years old did, and it was amazing, his relationship with his surroundings was amazing in all the weird ways which make it the more unique and interesting to follow. Yujiro Hanma too, unlike any other meathead in Anime really does leave an impression, his aura is hard felt, his intimidation radiates all over the screen, and his presence is always strong and encompasses everything and everyone around, definitely a runup for the best neutral antagonists out there, there is potential here and I'm excited to get to know more. I could run out of words here before I manage to appreciate every other character, Yuri, Hanayama, Yumi, Doppo, Tokugawa, Kato, Strydom, Gaia, Shinogi, and so on, all were amazing match-ups for Baki which makes it the more exciting and tempting to know who's next.\n\r\nThis is not a problem but it does get repetitive, there is always, somehow, a bigger, stronger world champion that was never foreshadowed or name-dropped until the point they are introduced as an opponent, it does feel like the author was making up a story as he went on, never having a clear ending in mind which also has the advantage of seeming more like adventure and coming of age story, you never know what would hit you next, but you're all on board for it.\n\r\nOverall: 7.2/10\n"

            "content": "\n                The fact that you've decided to read reviews of this show proves that you're either already fell into the trap, or have unknowingly stepped into a territory you don't want to be involved with and trust me, I learned that like a smack in the face too. The fact that it's serializing on TV, and the fact that it's PG-13 as rated on MyAnimeList shows how little hope is left for humanity. This is a show that will teach you to live in hiding, get you into wearing camo and talk with a kirmit-ty voice, this is a show straight of a rubbish bin, withno polish and no care to it, because they knew pretty well we will dig it nonetheless, and so we did. I'm so proud of this community.\n\r\n- Story (4/10):\r\nThere was definitely potential, but it swiftly faded away to naught just like the capsize of most of the featured girls.\r\nNobunaga Oda, a very specific name for a protagonist that's directly related to \u201cthe\u201d Japanese daimy\u014d Nobunaga Oda is blessed (or cursed, depending on how you see it, for me it was definitely blursed) with the ability to mysteriously bring back people who were attached to the original Nobunaga Oda from the past and resurrect them in his timeline, way back from when the age of consent didn't matter in marriage, and it just happened to be that the protagonist is your typical weeb creep that's very obsessed with loli's and steps quite often, on those dangerous areas trying to bait you into a dark cell as well. As he keeps gathering multiple chicks and a damn trap in his little harem.\r\nMy biggest problem with the show was the context, it's easily stripped way which only goes to show how relying it is on fan service the kind of fanservice that can get you into trouble, I guess it's my fault for not having a VPN but God, do they push it until the very limit, it turns into a game of just how far can you take it and still get away with it. this season was so weird.\n\r\n- Art (3/10):\r\nI've peeled better-looking potatoes than this, and my performance in the kitchen is not even that good.\r\nNot only does it stand for a trashy mislabeled Hentai, but its production is just like one. It gives off the same feeling every other Hentai does, all blurry and kind of foggy making you feel like way back when 360p was the shit.\r\nThe character designs look very generic and outdated compared to what we've had to in the past decade, I remember the original Hellsing looking better than this, and that's a series from 2002.\n\r\n- Sound (6/10):\r\nYou can't tell me those weren't Hentai voice actors they cast, I'm way too lazy to check the staff-list for that, but I'm calling it.\r\nThe show lacked everything that  calls for talented voice actors, so their performance wasn't really much of a hassle, mainly because of the average uninteresting dialogue that made up 20% of the vocal value of the show, with the other 80% all erotic moans.\r\nI at least got out a decent opening and ending songs out of this, so I guess it's a win-lose situation for me.\n\r\n- Characters (2/10):\r\nThat's as generous as I can get with this show. Seriously, all painted from the same brush, and that might be technically true, very blunt and attention-unworthy. In similar shows, the protagonist is almost always the less interesting character, a technic widely used so that the harem gets to shine and hopeful start a fan cult around each member of it, but not with this one. Not only their design was as generic as it gets, but they lacked every personality treat that might make them memorable for a while, the only visible difference was their capsize, but maybe that's what the show was trying to sell all along.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nI guess I would have enjoyed this one a bit more if it wasn't for the frequent questionable topics it touched upon, you know, I don't want to get locked into a cell and then be known as the guy who was imprisoned for watching an Anime, big guy Jos\u00e9 wouldn't like that I'm sure.\r\nSome moment were funny, but that's about as good as it was. Probably the most enjoyment I got was when the end credits were rolling up, knowing that I have finally flipped this chapter's cover, and hopefully will never get involved with this show ever again, please don't let there be another season of this, don't do this to me.\n\r\n- Overall (4.2/10):\r\nThis is exactly the kind of trash I never want to recommend, wherein doing so lies a great trap of exposing a crime publically. Nobody wants that. Just please stay away, or proceed with caution.\n"

The art is a soulless spooky and annoying to look at drawings that I could have sworn were made by a 1995version of MS Paint, and even after that went through the process of more pixelation.

            "content": "\n                Probably what's the award-winning Mangaka Akimi Yoshida best know for. \u201cBanana Fish\u201d, at the time it was being aired sure made a loud boom in the Anime fandom, a scream that the original fans of the source material are sure to be the one who heard first. For a Manga from the years 1985-1994 to only receive an Anime adaptation after 24 years from its conclusion, which compliments perfectly the number of episodes it has (I don't know if that was an act of coincidence or made or purpose) sure was a surprise to all of us, and it was a welcomed one.\r\nThe show isoften met by a lot of homophobic criticism as it heavily deals with gay references and implies heavily on that, those are probably the people that miss the point from the story as the case with the characters that can really be substituted by anybody else and still carry on the plot in the same manner.\r\nI feel like, for that alone, the majority of bad reviews come from those type of people that couldn't handle a simple plot device and ended up trashing the whole franchise without even (Most likely) properly finishing it.\r\nOne other side note to make, don't let the fact that this show is labeled as \u201cShoujo\u201d fool you, it doesn't hold back on diving into torture, child pornography and abusive content at all. So beware.\n\n\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nOne guy was blessed with beauty and strength. Something deeply desired by the average human being is only met with a faith worse than that of a stray dog. We're talking hoodlum of the streets and lowlife gangs, government conspiracies and threatening life and the doorstep of a brutal crime family in the unforgiving streets of New York, such is the life of Ash.\r\nThat is until he met this innocent Japanese dude that clearly was playing with fire without even realizing it.\r\nThe plot in general moves at a very considerable pace, neutrally fast natured, action-packed and also doesn't fall short on contrasting the amount of action with an overdose of homosexual encounters. As it follows the story of an abused young kid, it captured perfectly the horror of what was the hell poor Ashlan had to deal with from an extremely young age to his now 17/18 years old self.\r\nI personally am not into the homosexuality side of the show, but it doesn't really matter in the greatest side of things, because there was still a plot to carry on down the road, and as the show tried to clear out, those are real-world problems and we just have to face them at one point or another.\r\nThe biggest problem with this show is the unbalanced choice of turnarounds. The plot relies heavily on a repetitive cat and mouse game that does really get into your nerve at a certain point. Like seriously, every single arc was just the same thing, only having different characters involved. And what was even lamer, it only revolved around this unwanted stranger (Eiji) that every part targeted him for being the supposed \u201cweakness\u201d of Ashlan. It really gets lame after a while.\r\nAside from the action and thrill filling the screen, there was a great part of the story occupied only with sadness and sorrow, grief at the corner of every backstory there is, which by the way was all concerning Ash.\r\nI get that the story revolves mainly about him, but that's pouring too much focus the guy that a lot of other great characters are easily neglected and untouched upon.\n\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\r\nThis is only noticeable after a little while. It is no doubt that the series was greatly produced from a visual side. Not only was it set in an American setting, but it felt like another Hollywood adaptation with the way the camera angles were and the action scenes in particular. You could tell how American the show felt just by analyzing the cinematography that went on all camera shots and direction in general.\r\nThe weakest point here was the inconsistency of art style. It's not the fault of the source material being that old and so it had its mark of age visually speaking. The original artwork has its charm as well, but the majority of the time, there was a continuous shift between the original art style and a more modern take at times, especially considering character design and faces. It was most apparent from side shots where a character looks dated seen from the side until he or she turns him or her head directly at the camera when it's suddenly this very +2010 type of art style.\r\nThat really did nothing to hold back the series per se, however, it was worth noting how uncanny of them that was. Going either by the original art style or a new modernized one would have had the same effect, but mixing to very different and distinguishable was kind of weird.\r\nNot to close an eye on animation, for that one was very well taken care of. Studio MAPPA invested some clearly-felt effort in this adaptation with their cleanly animated fight scenes, especially the ones involving epic martial art and bullet exchange.\n\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nI'm just going to jump straight into complimenting Hirata Hiroaki, the same legend behind the voice over of Sanji from One Piece. It was impossible for me to unhear that as soon as I realized it.\r\nAsh's performance by Uchida Yuuma, a figure not that well known in the medium, at least compared to somebody like Max's voice actor (Hirata Hiroaki), but apparently, talent isn't tied to how big your name is, and thus, I won't blame you if you thought that performance was the result of some world-class voice actor because I know I thought the same. Mr. Yuuma really carried on that role perfectly seeing how much of the emotional shifts they series goes through, from screaming of anger to crying in pain, it felt natural either way.\r\nI can't say I got an enormous enjoyment from the collection of soundtracks used here, sure they highlighted some of the intense gunfights, but it was too intense most of the time that it was hard to even notice.\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs were of another league. I wasn't the one appreciating them from the first encounter, but they sure grow on you that you're too attached to let go when they are changed, and the same happens with the new ones just shortly after.\n\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\r\nI was greatly disappointed when it came for characters.\r\nAsh was clearly given most of the spotlights if not all of them, as hard and catastrophic everything was for him, you could at least beg for a wider selection of interesting characters. Yes, there were plenty of exciting faces, but the show wasted a huge opportunity to invest in them.\r\nThe only characters I think of that had the greatest character development in the show were Ash and Sing. And still, Sing lacked any interesting backstory or anything of that sort to better explain his motives, he was just there as sort of a replacement for another character that died.\r\nThere were some really brilliant faces, like Blanca, Max, Shorter, Yut-Lung and I could only keep going, too bad it went all to waste.\r\nThe show really only seem to focus on a character if it was doomed into dying the next episode, it almost became like an obvious pattern to their death sentences.\r\nOne other very weak aspect was the constant buffing of Ash's profile and the extraordinary amount of plot armor. Ash was introduced as this cold killed that didn't care much for the higher power and was just doing what he always did in order to survive. Until they kept up throwing plot devices like how incredibly of a high IQ he had. And I don't really care if he was that much smart or just another brainless hoodlum, but it was too painfully obvious to come up with that just when some secret intelligencies started investigating in his plotting. Not only that but on realistic notes, the things he survived through would put him into the status of a superhuman, nobody can carry on a fist fight, holding on to a weightful adult body that's about to fall and more, and that's just after not only taking a beating but also after being stabbed at the shoulder repeatedly. If anything, he should have bled out until he went unconscious, but I guess you just got to pull some out of the world plot devices to steer down the action I guess.\r\nLeaving plot armor abuse aside. Some character really had a messed up sense of logic. Take Yut-Lung for example, going as far as cursing one's blood and at the same breath expresses how blood has nothing to do with anything.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nDespite a lot of disqualifications, this was a hell of a trip.\r\nSitting back on your couch and enjoying a show isn't that hard, especially with an action-packed entry such as this one, but ranting over the little things is one part of the enjoyment, at least for me.\r\nThere was a minimal annoyance for me when it came to homosexual references, but that was easily cooped up with, as I said, it really isn't about the character as they are easily substitutable.\r\nConcerning the relationship between Ash and Eiji, I don't really think there was anything implying that they were meant as a couple. I know I wouldn't want that, but it's not about what I want, they really were just best friends that contrasted each other, call it best buddies or bromance. Whatever suits ya.\n\n\r\nOverall (7.2/10):\r\nI should really raise the point of homophobic-ism, this show doesn't hold back on being somewhat of an extreme gay-ism, if you're not in good terms with that, you're better off not watching this show, as I've seen a lot of people get severely disappointed by that on different parts of the series, and end up dropping the show. But if you don't mind any of that, this would really make for an amazing ride, one that also doesn't care about your tiny fragile heart, and thus shows you the hell that Ash went through that you'd better be thankful you didn't. God be with all the people suffering from the same thing in real life. Have fun.\n"

            "content": "\n                The return of \"Goblin Slayer II\" to our screens is akin to a reunion with an old friend for many fans. This sentiment rings especially true for those who, like myself, had their first taste of seasonal anime with the debut of Goblin Slayer. The second season, launched on Blu-ray and DVD in a three-volume set between January and March 2024, rekindles the familiar thrill and brutality that marked its initial foray into the anime world.\n\r\nDiving into the story, it's evident that \"Goblin Slayer II\" aims to maintain the momentum of its predecessor, albeit with some hits and misses. The narrative carries on the relentlesspace and dark undertones, which are both a hallmark of the series. However, there's a sense that the plot could have delved deeper, exploring more intricate layers of the Goblin Slayer universe. Despite this, the storyline does an admirable job of keeping viewers engaged, with enough twists to keep the narrative from feeling stale.\n\r\nVisually, the series steps up its game. The animation quality in this season shows a noticeable improvement, with more fluid and dynamic battle sequences that are a feast for the eyes. This enhancement in animation quality adds a new dimension to the viewing experience, making every encounter with the goblins more intense and immersive.\n\r\nThe sound design in \"Goblin Slayer II\" is another aspect where the series shines. The soundtrack and voice acting are meticulously crafted, amplifying the overall atmosphere of the series. The soundtracks set the tone perfectly, whether in the heat of battle or during more somber, reflective moments, adding layers of emotional depth to the narrative.\n\r\nCharacter development in this season is a mixed bag. While the main cast, especially Goblin Slayer, continues to evolve in intriguing ways, some of the supporting characters feel underutilized. Despite this, the chemistry among the characters is as strong as ever, making their interactions one of the highlights of the series. Their relationships provide a sense of continuity and comfort, particularly for those who have been on this journey since the first season.\n\r\nEnjoyment-wise, \"Goblin Slayer II\" delivers a robust package. It successfully recaptures the essence of what made the original series appealing while also introducing new elements to keep the audience's interest. The blend of brutal action, a dark fantasy setting, and character interactions creates a satisfying watch, especially for returning fans.\n\r\n\"Goblin Slayer II\" marks a welcome return to a series that has carved out its own niche in the anime world. While it may not break new ground in terms of storytelling, its improvements in animation and sound, combined with the familiar comfort of its characters, make it a sequel worth watching. For those who have been eagerly waiting for its return, this season does not disappoint, serving as a brutal yet captivating continuation of a beloved journey.\n\r\nOverall: 7.48/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                It has been so talked about in the fandom, how this Anime would uneven the planes once it airs, this and that, but let me tell you, as a Manga reader and one fascinated about Fujimoto's works. It was a nice change of pace. I was never a sucker for \"Chainsaw-man\" when I read the Manga, but the Anime ultimately was the better version of the story, and that rarely if ever happens.\n\r\nOne of the things that I really appreciated about \"Chainsaw-man\" was the way that it blended together a variety of different genres and themes. The show has elements of action, comedy, and horror,and it does a great job of balancing these different elements to create a cohesive and engaging story. The characters are all well-developed and likable, and their interactions with one another are a highlight of the show.\n\r\nThe animation and art style of \"Chainsaw-man\" are also top-notch. The character designs are all unique and memorable, and the action scenes are fast-paced and visually impressive. The show's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with a mix of energetic and atmospheric music that helps to set the mood and enhance the overall experience.\n\r\nOne of the few criticisms that I have of \"Chainsaw-man\" is that it can be a bit heavy-handed at times with its themes and message. The show tackles some heavy subject matter, including issues of power and corruption, and it doesn't always do so in the most subtle way. That being said, this is a minor issue that does not significantly detract from the overall enjoyment of the show.\n\r\nThe music and voice acting in \"Chainsaw-man\" are major strengths of the show. The music, in particular, is a standout feature of the show, with a mix of energetic and atmospheric tracks that help to set the mood and enhance the overall experience. The unique ending songs for each episode are a particularly nice touch, as they add an extra layer of personality and character to the show.\n\r\nThe voice acting is also top-notch, with each character being brought to life by talented voice actors who are able to convey a wide range of emotions and nuances in their performances. The characters feel like fully-realized individuals, and their voices help to bring them to life in a way that feels authentic and genuine.\n\r\nOne of the things that I particularly appreciated about the music and voice acting in \"Chainsaw-man\" is that it feels grounded and realistic, rather than feeling overly exaggerated or caricatured in the way that some anime can. This helps to make the show feel more immersive and easier to connect with, and it adds to the overall enjoyment of the show.\n\r\nThe use of CGI is particularly noteworthy, as it is used in a way that enhances the overall animation rather than feeling like a substitute for traditional animation techniques. The CGI is seamlessly integrated into the show and helps to bring the action scenes to life in a way that feels dynamic and visually impressive.\n\r\nThe character animation is also top-notch, with each character being brought to life in a way that feels natural and believable. Even small moments of idle talking or casual blinking feel fully realized and help to bring the characters to life in a way that feels authentic and genuine.\n\r\nAnother thing that I particularly appreciate about the animation in \"Chainsaw-man\" is its consistency. The show maintains a high level of quality throughout its run, and there are no noticeable dips in animation quality or shortcuts taken in the animation process. This attention to detail is a major plus and helps to make the show feel like a fully realized and well-crafted anime. I mean, what next? Sakuga talking with impact frames? I'm up for that.\n\r\nOne of the things that sets \"Chainsaw-man\" apart from other anime is the way that it deviates from the typical seasonal formula and borrows from real world cinema. Rather than following a traditional episodic structure, \"Chainsaw-man\" tells a more continuous and cohesive story that is more akin to a film than a typical TV show. This helps to give the show a sense of momentum and keeps the story feeling fresh and engaging.\n\r\nAdditionally, \"Chainsaw-man\" borrows heavily from real world cinema, with a number of scenes and sequences that feel inspired by classic films. This adds an extra layer of depth and personality to the show, and helps to make it feel like more than just a typical anime.\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Chainsaw-man\" is a thrilling and entertaining anime TV show that is sure to appeal to fans of action, comedy, and horror. I would especially recommend \"Chainsaw-man\" to adult viewers, as the show tackles some mature themes and subject matter that may not be suitable for younger audiences. However, anyone who enjoys a good action-packed and character-driven story is sure to find something to love about \"Chainsaw-man\". Overall, it is a highly recommendable show that is sure to leave a lasting impression.\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                One of the most controversial and objectively widely spread in the concerning conversation is the importance of \u201cgood\u201d animation, notice how I highlighted that adjective for how different fluent and good animation, responsive animation, animation that adapts, remains consistent and overall, doesn't mask out the importance of the plot.\n\r\nDoes a good animation make up for a flawed plot? Does it improve mediocre writing? Or does the plot and everything else make up for the lack of it? For one, animation is a core part of what makes Anime... AnImE. Not only is it in the name (Anim-e-ation) but it's what separates it from its sourcematerial, be it Manga, Light Novels, Games ...etc.\n\r\n\u201cKimetsu no Yaiba\u201d (Demon Slayer) was on the better-good side in all of this. I'm by every respect new to Ufotable, \u201cGyo\u201d was the only production of them that I had ever seen, and oh boy was it a disappointment. Probably at the time, I had labeled it together with Toei Animation and Studio Pierrot, but after watching this newborn Shounen marvel, the disappointment was in myself for not doing enough homework, of course, they are the folks behind the Fate series, so why would this be any more of a surprise? This installment has for sure secured their name next to the mainstream highly praised Mad House, Kyoto Animation, Studio Bones and the likes...\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nJust another tiring snowy day, Tanjirou comes back home to find his family slaughtered in his front door, it must have been the world of a wild animal, a hungry bear passing by, it has to, the house is isolated in the middle of what seems like an empty forest, and his family's corpses have all gotten cold in bruises already, except for his Sister Nezuko who he happens to carry and run to see a doctor for her immediately. To his surprise, what has always been a tale of old, with savage claws and wild look, Nezuko stands up as nothing happened to her, and straight went for the kill. Realizing that his sister has become what is known as a Demon, a flesh-eating mysterious race that lives off human blood, set off to look for a cure, hoping that one day he would lift this curse from his beloved sister.\n\r\nBit by bit, he finds himself rolling for an anti-demon organization called the Demon Slayers, climbing up the ranks to hopefully one day have a shot at lifting this eternal curse off of his young Nezuko.\n\r\nThe series spans 26 episodes, which tells serializing story through bursts of short and related arcs, significantly fast pace that doesn't sleep on any sneaked up filler if there was any.\n\r\nAt a cellular core, it is still a Shounen story and a mediocre one at that. I did not feel any complicated plot threads of any trace of a plot twist that keeps you thinking, but Ufotable's magnificent work almost made up for everything accountable.\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nWithout a doubt, the best \u201cconsistent\u201d animation of the year, no contest, and note how I'm highlighting the consistency of it, because of phenomenal shows like Mob Psycho 100 II, Kaguya-sama love is war, Attack on Titan to name a few have blessed 2019 with some of the best visuals in the industry. I'm not going to say that Kimetsu no Yaiba surpasses all of them in every department, however, the consistency part stays faithful to the same degree of perfection through its serialization.\n\r\nI don't have a huge experience with CGI heavy show, the thought of it has always scared me that I couldn't give a majority of shows a chance, however starting to watch this show, it took me a long time to even notice that all this time, CGI was always prominent, but how couldn't I notice it sooner? Because it was done well. It might be the best example I've seen of such implementation as it kept me begging for more for the first time in my life.\n\r\nThe special effects department was the selling point for me, and probably for most people, so unique and fresh that I started to associate with the show as a primary flench, if that wasn't enough, the use of high frame rate animation boost the visual capabilities and enhances the experience miles above your average 24 fps show, it's almost as not wanting to go back. It makes the slow-motion (Which looks incredible in this show) scenes look tons of times better and more intense, the sense of scale and impact is perfectly emulated through the use of impact frame and 3D cinematography trickery that puts the show in a visual level on its league.\r\nThe character designs were vivid, full of life, despite their dead-inside eyes. They reflect their personalities in a great manner and help them indicate their importance by blending each one of them differently with their surrounding backgrounds.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nIt is shocking to hear that a 26 episodes long show nowadays would only feature a single pair opening and ending theme songs, but Kimetsu no Yaiba did one each, and did them so well that you no longer start asked for another one, because once you hear those two, you get a special kind of vocal fulfillment that reflect perfectly on the mood of the series. I would even be fine if they end up reusing them for the upcoming sequels too. The soundtrack records were phenomenal, one of the best, they have a presence, they have emotion, they have intensity, they are almost a physical 3rd party that's present during every necessary moment of hype, sadness, or happiness.\r\nI don't think there were any complaints about the voice actors and actresses from the fandom at all, which only praises the skilled cast members selected to perform this spectacle.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nLet's get the skeletal character design out of the picture first, unique and fresh, it gave me some strong vibes of a mixture between Boku no Hero Academia and Yakusoku no Neverland. Characters appear short but bulky. The clothing varies from place to place, almost telling a separate story of time and struggle. Extremely colorful just like the world they inhabit, with distinct hairstyles, creative eye color palette, and radiating charisma that matches its skeleton.\n\r\nWhile nothing groundbreaking, it takes the norm and levels it up, cleans up the mesh and exposes the clich\u00e9 troop, almost ridiculing it. Tanjitou is your casual Shounen protagonist that's filled with energy, determination, and a dream to fulfill, yet, he remains to be a chill and calm (for a protagonist) dude that doesn't get on the nerve.\n\r\nPeople would nominate Nezuko to be the best female of the year, but I wouldn't stand behind that seeing how 90% of the time, she's sleeping inside of a wooden box, not much proper screen time to begin with. The duo Inosuke and Zenitsu are complementary to each other, the same way a savage beast and a cowardly cat would interact with each other, but don't let that clich\u00e9 facade scare you away, as they do have personal interests into making plot-level decisions.\n\r\nMuzen, that makes up for the villain is also an interesting figure that spreads sinister deeds throughout the series, raising a culprit question in the first episode and remaining there to stay till the very last with a common but interesting ideology that remains to be explored.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nI remember when the community was on heels for this show when it was first starting, I don't jump on the seasonal bandwagon very early on, so I gave the shows serializing ta the time some accumulation time for me to start binging whatever content I catch up on, and Kimetsu no Yaiba was there for me, but a bit earlier. The hype and the loud praise I hear had me start watching when it was still 5 episodes in, and for a show of +25 it's quite unusual for me to rush in whilst the first chunk of 12 episodes isn't there yet. The hype was real, it was honest and welcoming from the get-go. I had my fair share of waiting weekly for new episodes and even a greater blast presenting it to my siblings. The lack of shameless fan service makes it easy to recommend to the public too.\n\r\n2019 was packed for great shows already, and this gem made a name of itself even with all the clutter.\n\r\nOverall (8.7/10):\r\nIn short, Kimetsu no Yaiba is an experience that one shall not pass on, it is sure to become a classic among the new horde of this decade's Anime, and watching it while serializing was definitely something to tell the people of tomorrow, for it is only a sparkling growing series that shall one day be praised and paired together with the titans of this medium, the same way the big three were.\n\r\nIt is a show that can be rewatched several times, a show that can be binged without getting bored easily, a show that shall and will be remembered and brought up into conversations in the coming years, for how a masterful visual production value it had going for it, and almost lustful vocal complements as well, a piece hard to come up with criticism for but also very easy to hate.\n"

With this out of the way, let me expand on this more.\n\r\nI, unlike many people, fell off early on the first season, the content was just that generic at best to me, the characters did not interest me in theslightest and the power system, while pretty, did not tingly anything inside of me, and the biggest miss was the finale of the first season, we get introduced to so many new characters that even the ones we spent an entire season with didn't even warm up to me for me to care about any new faces, HOWEVER, Mugan Train changed everything.\n\r\nThis arc was sort of a re-introduction to the whole series, I got to appreciate Tanjiro and the trio more for what they arc, not only that, but Rengoku went from a nobody to one of if not the best characters in the show in the span of one arc.\n\r\nAs this was basically a chopped-off version of the movie, the animation and how breathtakingly glorious it was persisted its quality, with some new direction changes introduced as additional camera angles and slight touches here and there, it did not fall out of the place.

            "content": "\n                 I trust that you already know the drill so far. Seasonal show, superpowers, Shounen, Ecchi, attractively fluid animation... They sell every time.\n\r\n\u201cEnen no Shounboutai\u201d or \u201cFire Force\u201d is THE regular, mediocre, highly praised mainstream seasonal show, and has been ever since it first aired, getting a lot of traction with a fairly loyal fanbase, but what would you blame it for? The entertainment that one seeks in any type of Anime is there, however, there is a lot of nags about still.\n\r\n\u201cFire Force\u201d introduces itself with a fresh and very appealing concept, revolving about firefighters, but with a twist. Fighting fire with fire hadalways sounded very cool in words, but it's even cooler seeing it animated. But how far can raw action and tense interaction save a dull, uninteresting population of background characters that don't even up each other aside from their key designs?\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nIn a world where people randomly combust, transforming into demon-looking monsters, labeled as Infernals, a dude with a creepy smile called Shinra is set on a quest to finding his brother that was lost in an Infernal related incident, which led him to join an Infernal fighting organization that fights fire with fire. A fast-paced display of all types and forms of Pyrochenisis, resulting in some very creative ways of manipulating flames. From generically lighting up candles to straight-up turning fire into ice.\n\r\nI don't want to sound harsh, but it felt like if the plot was a living, breathing human, it would have had a grave case of ADHD where it tends to lose itself very often, turning its back on what's important and letting loose to the greedy Ecchi inserts, like some annoying Youtube ad that jumps you off when you least expect it. Some Ecchi is fine, but inappropriately have it presented on very crucial turnouts of the story is very belittling for the build-up that those moments have.\n\r\nThe story is very linear, it has a defining start and end, and moves at a decent pace that spans multiple short arcs. The plot revelations, however, seem quite lacking, extremely overshadowed by the fast pacing and the intense action, leaving all the important bullet points to stand as a boring and unappealing filter.\n\r\nArt (8.7/10):\r\nPersonally, this was both the selling factor, and the key attraction that got me into this show in the first place. The visuals are so powerful and very polished, to say the least. The atmosphere is delivered flawlessly through a variation of practical effects and varying color palettes that reflect perfectly on the lighting condition and the overarching shading. It was so delicious to the eye and leads the action so well.\r\nThe character design has its ups and downs, there are some really thought up designs, but there is also a lot of mediocre-looking characters, from the caliber of Hentai protagonists you're not supposed to be looking at.\r\nThe Infernals strike a powerful presence that reflects on the visual assertion alone. A feeling of a demon in presence is well inflected by how menacing and malice radiating they are. Props to the visual designers on that.\r\nAlso, if I need to bring it, the Tamaki crying scene. 10/10 facial expression.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nLet me start by praising the fantastic bundle of opening and ending theme songs. Well, they are not equally on part with quality and delivery. The first opening really takes the cake here, an absolute party banger that shamelessly enough, took me some time to get the hand of. The second one still turns me off to this day, but it has a great vibe to it and is by no mean a bad opening song. The endings were just amazing as well.\n\r\nAnother thing I really appreciate and is very underrated as it's often looked down on in other shows are the sound effects. Oh My God, the combustion sound effects are eargasming, quite literally. There is so much force and pressure behind those sounds it's imaginable how powerful of a scene they can produce when coupled with the right visual spectacle.\n\r\nThe voice acting was on point but still average for the most part. I would want to personally congratulate these specific 3 voice actors. The ones behind Obi (Nakai, Kazuya), Tamaki (Yuuki, Aoi), and Dr. Giovanni.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nIt feels like forever since I was this disappointed in the characters of a show. What was it? \u201cAkame ga Kill\u201d? Yeah, it must have been it, both names give me the same disappointment chills.\r\nI wanted to believe, I wanted to get immersed, but the characters looked like some uninviting crude figures, very unfriendly and hardly if at all relatable. Except of course for a minority, like Captain Obi, the rest of the cast looked like complete strangers from an unrelated series.\r\nCharacter development? None, well, if powerups were a development, then that's all you get, the only time I think I saw a decent character progression was Vulcan's.\r\nI recognize potential when I see it, and this show had plenty, but it seems it favored the cash-hungry marketing ploy of prioritizing Ecchi elements over anything else, I'm not familiar with the source material, so I can't speak of this unfortunate treat inheritance or where it was inspired from.\r\nNow, from what concerns the female characters, the real victims in my eyes. They were extremely brutalized by how much sexualization they received. And I'm not against that primarily for \u201ccensorship\u201d reasons, no, shows like High School DxD that live off sexualization did not screw it up this bad. Theoretically speaking, the female characters would have had incredible writing by nature, but the overly promoted Ecchi inserts came in the way and ruined the better part of their development. Pointing my fingers at Hibana and Tamaki here.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nIt seems I really love my Shounen Anime, and too much sometimes. I know what about to happen for how predictable and clich\u00e9 everything is, but it is still so damn exciting to see it delivered, like that one song you enjoy, you know you have heard it hundreds of times already, but still, the enjoyment you get each time you hear it is an experience that you keep wanting to come back to. \u201cEnen no Shounboutai\u201d fueled my mediocre Shounen flu for the season, it served for quite the guilty pleasure for a while, and to be honest, I wouldn't have been any sadder if the second season was never announced, but it seems I at least have a cure for when this pleasing flu comes back.\n\r\nOverall (7.34/10):\r\nSurprisingly enough, it was something I'd recommend for even the newcomers to the medium. It is a simple enough plot and setup that can be understood even by the mentally challenged. Don't expect a groundbreaking, thoughts provoking, moral changing masterpiece, however, it is a sit-through worthy of that popcorn fill price. Have fun.\n"

The Infinity Castle sequence was so gorgeous that it's flabbergasting how impossible to surpass what they make it look like every time. Theinclusion of the climax fight from last season was great to see on the bigger scene, but the real star was the Swordssmithing Village arc content.\n\r\nThe whole intro sequence really, was booming with talent, from animation to sound design, voice acting to pacing and cinematography. It was too good to be true at times.\n\r\nThis was the first time this show made me laugh. I found that the humor had better delivery and timing in this new ac, subtle, but way more effective. The new characters look interesting as also the newly introduced demons.\n\r\nThe opening theme at the end was very good, song and visual-wise. The whole thing was so good that it's getting boring writing anything bashful about it in this review.\n\r\nOverall: 8.46/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                Minor spoilers below!\n\r\nAfter witnessing the spectacular serialization of the 2011 recut of Hunter x Hunter, as much as I loved it, it was only logical to crave for any related content, and the movies were the easiest, fastest and more accessible options left for me to experience before investing on whatever is available from Manga content. Like any great show, even between itself, it tries to up itself for how ridiculously high expectations it sets, and the praise this series gets only re-affirms that. But that is the kind of bittersweet drug that more than often leads to disappointment, but I was too blinded, waytoo excited to dive into something that unfortunately did not live up to my fantasies.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nIt took me a second to realize how rushed and forced the setting of the movie was. Looking at the fast pacing of the parent show, you wouldn't even decide for a suitable moment to base an entire movie story and having it make sense without any skepticism from the viewers, but unfortunately, this movie was anything but that.\r\nThe movie suffered from having an overloaded cast of characters, so much so, it didn't manage to properly focus on them all, like you'd have your selling figures, Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika. Aside from Kurapipa being the trigger that started the whole story of the movie, Gon and Killua were the \u201ccameramen\u201d that guided us through this journey, having them butt in the business of a former Phantom Troup member which later has the members of the Spider involved in one way or another.\r\nThe story was as simple as having the kids explore the town around, make a friend along the way, struggle against the villain, and then come back with a win on their second confrontation, pretty basic storytelling.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nHunter x Hunter's selling point was never in its visual. To say the least, Hunter x Hunter had a very consistent and eye resting animation that never strains the eye. However, for a movie, this wasn't all that captivating, I would argue the parent show looked better some times, I probably can point up to two scenes at most in this movie, where my jaw was leaning to drop in aww. Movies have been stereotyped to feature world-class animations, especially coming from both a big series, and a recognized animation studio, but this was just not it.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nHunter x Hunter will always go down as one of the best vocal auditions I've ever heard in Anime, I love hearing the main characters, Gon and Killua to be exact while arguing all the time, they are just that good, and that's only speaking of the goofs, as when more serious characters partake in a conversation, it's audibly tingling on many neural levels.\r\nI thought the classic OST remixes from the parent shows were a great come back too.\n\r\nCharacter (7/10);\r\nHunter x Hunter for me, in terms of its characters, main or side they were, that's always a guaranteed 10/10. But it would be a bit too biased to stamp the 10/10 mark on this one just because it has the hunter name on it (very hard to not stamp it though), for now, we'll only focus on the movie original characters, specifically, the villain dude, and the friend that Gon and Killua made. And to be frank, I thought the weird hole-filled dude from the phantom troupes had me more interested in him than these two combined. They just didn't feel like characters from the same plane of existence as the rest of the cast.\r\nPoorly written characters that live off a chlich\u00e9 troupe that east from the plate of revenge, that's almost for the sake of just that.\r\nIt was nice to see the Phantom Troupes make camera appearances, Hisoka and Chrollo too, glimpses of other characters like Kite and Ging at the end as well.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nNot going to lie, as soon as I noticed myself constantly checking the time towards the end of the movie, I knew it let my hopes down.\r\nIt was cool and exciting at the start, but it grew dull nearing the end. Lesson learned for the next and last Hunter x Hunter movie.\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10):\r\nWelp, at least I learned to tame my expectations, but seriously though. I could have made it just fine without seeing the movie, it didn't add anything new to the Hunter x Hunter experience, it felt like a totally different series, no related vibes whatsoever were felt.\n"

I really was expecting some fan service but we were clean after all, I'm actually glad they didn't include such emphasis, and hey, let's move to the bigger picture now.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nWhile not exceptional, it really holds up to this kind of shows, the animation is not bad by any means. the character designs were on point, no excessive use of still imagery, so that'sa plus.\n\r\n- Characters (7.5/10):\r\nThere aren't so many characters, to be honest, but for this short show, it does have some excuses, but, the characters that we have do differ a great deal, their personalities and even design is enough to distinguish them apart, but weirdly enough, there was a lack of character development for the main cast, in the other hand, side characters did change throughout the story, the likes of Ebina and Kirie.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nAbsolutely nothing remarkable, vague even for a slice of life anime, the story doesn't progress, but then again it shouldn't, the score would have been much lower if it weren't for some serious moments every now and then, like the past between Taihei and that girl from his work...etc.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nYes, if there is something I absolutely adore in this show, is the adorable itself soundtracks, those little symphonies that play in the background ahhhh, man, it really adds in a big difference.\r\nThe opening is very, very good, I can also say that it was one of the reasons I even stuck to this show in the first place, The ending while not very bad, does get familiar.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nI've had this on my to-watch-list for a very long tile now, and as any of the shows that are still collecting dust there to this very day, I was afraid that it would turn into a complete disappointment, but NO!!\r\nLiterally, a very cheerful comedy slice of life, I mainly enjoyed the huge among of references, especially the \u201cOne Piece\u201d ones.\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\r\nWould I recommend this? Not for everyone, It's for those people who had watched enough anime, read enough manga to be able to get that cheer among of references because honestly, the good part of the comedy in this show comes from the crazy references to other works.\n"

            "content": "\n                The \"FLCL\" franchise has had its share of ups and downs, and unfortunately, \"FLCL: Shoegaze\" falls into the latter category. Serving as a sequel to \"FLCL Alternative,\" this series takes place a decade after its predecessor. While expectations were high, it's clear that \"Shoegaze\" doesn't live up to the quirky brilliance of the original \"FLCL.\"\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it's disheartening to see that this series inherits the same problems that plagued \"FLCL Alternative.\" The spin-offs have failed to capture the essence and uniqueness that made the original \"FLCL\" such a cult classic. \"Shoegaze\" continues the tradition of trying to replicate the magic of the original and,sadly, failing to do so.\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most baffling aspects of \"Shoegaze\" is how it manages to take a step back in terms of storytelling and character development. Despite taking place a decade later, the high school setting and the introduction of new characters feel like a missed opportunity. While the original \"FLCL\" thrived on its eccentricity and subversion of typical anime tropes, \"Shoegaze\" plays it safe with a predictable and unremarkable plotline.\n\r\nIt's disheartening to say that \"FLCL: Grunge,\" another installment in the series, surpasses \"Shoegaze\" in many aspects. \"Grunge\" embraced unconventional 3D animation, created a unique artistic experience, and introduced fresh takes on beloved characters. In comparison, \"Shoegaze\" feels like a regression rather than a progression.\n\r\nUltimately, \"FLCL: Shoegaze\" leaves fans longing for the bizarre and unforgettable experience of the original series. It's a reminder that sometimes, attempting to revive a classic can lead to a disappointing imitation. While it's a nod to the franchise's legacy, it's also a stark reminder that capturing lightning in a bottle twice is no easy feat.\n\r\nOverall: 5.08/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                What made me watch this garbage of a show anyways? (spoken like my true teen-self), back in the day, I used to binge watch all sorts of classic anime shows, and this particular one used to air daily for a while, and I hated the heck out of it, that I would curse the day, and the author that came up with, but, little did I know (pun intended), the story was much more mature for my age, and so, I missed up on a lot of plot points, but man, has this redescouvery ride fixed a couple of brain wrecks I had since thatday, come along, and let me tell you how probably one of the worst shows in my childhood, is competing with the rare gems I love and dear today...\n\r\n- Story (9.8/10):\r\nGankutsuou is a story about revenge, I know it sounds very clich\u00e9 repetitive, and I can confirm that myself, but, never have I seen a more perfect story execution in the medium as this one, the action is very weak, but the strong aspect here is the drama, ever heard of the saying \u201cNostalgia is a drug\u201d? the drama in this show is an overdose of drugs used at once, I had these moments while watching where I could almost choke emotionally while witnessing the follow up of earlier events, that result in an impact equivalent of that of a mighty nuclear warhead.\n\r\nI've watched a lot of shows, most of them are what the typical anime viewers would call masterpieces, works of art, and it's a shame that they disregard a beautiful story of this caliber, because, and I repeat, the quality you'll get watch thins is incomparable. Now I'm a sucker for good plot points, story pacing, I do not encourage linear storytelling too, this show, on the other hand, keeps jumping between several periods in the timeline, trying to make you, the viewer, link everything together, it really makes you feel as present as any other character in the story, something that's very underrated in storytelling nowadays.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nI'm gonna come up and say it, I love this artstyle, at first glance, It was distracting, and at times, hard to even tell some characters apart, and that was a harsh reminder of how much I hated this show, to begin with, but then again, I've experiencd the same with One Piece, and then grew to adore it, it's the exact same senario here, this one the most unique artstyle I've ever laied eyes on, I know dead well, that anybody know to this type of shows would judge me for the fool artist I am, those artists that draw absolute nonesense and call it art, that's what I'm talking about, but do not fall in that trap, do not lett the artstyle keep you away from experiencing the story behind this work, because trust me, you will grow to love it, probably more than you think you would.\n\r\nEverything is drawn like your typical anime style, but having fixed textures applied to them make them feel like moving literature out of some ancient novel and that's what the source material is really, the CG doesn't look half bad to me, unlike most of the modern hows, at least it doesn't feel out of place that much.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nHow can I grow old on the opening song, the ending one was okay, but it's at the opening that it shines, ah, I can already feel the lighthearted expression I'm making while singing the lyrics in my head, it's almost distracting, love it.\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another vital aspect of the show, alongside Attack on titan's youseebiggirl and Code Geass's stories, this one is just, aaah, perfection upon perfection, I can't get tired from replying it, as it gives you some strong nostalgic feeling about the characters in the series, as if they were part of your life, and I don't tend to seem and bit of a Weeabo here, just saying.\n\r\nThe voice acting was also a sweet, sweet orange juice in a Monday morning, I just love the french dialogs are the beginning of every episode, as the story is set at Paris for the most part, this really sets you in the mood of a French noble, getting some Marie Antoinette vibes yet? oh god, you will during this ride, and I bet my [insert something you want here] you'll love it.\r\nThe voice acting cast is also pretty intense and great at playing tragedy, considering 95% of the show is one,\n\r\n- Character (9.5/10):\r\nThe characters, yes, my favourite aspect of Gankutsuou, what I really like here, is that you hate the characters that you supposed to hate, and like the ones that the author wants you to like, you have no excuses not to really, for once, you might adore characters that are absolutely evil, and with you being fully informed of that nonetheless.\r\nThe main character isn't perfect, although, that's debatable, he's still young, and he can make mistakes, the thing that makes him relatable to most viewers, other supporting characters vary, in both characteristics and treats, that you are guaranteed to be injured emotionally whenever something bad affects them, and it happens A LOT.\n\r\nIf I was set to choose, I'd pick the count of mount Cristo, to be the best character in diosplay, for instance, someone might tell you, who's the best, most iconic anime character with a mask, some would say, It's Lelouch (from Code Geass), with his helmet like mask, someother may swear their swords on Kanaki's (from Tokyo Ghoul), but that's debadable, however, I dare you not to nominate the count as the greatest, most classy character, with a cloack, probably in all of the fiction, that elegant bastard is just starting over starts of luxury and complexity.\r\nThere is also Franz, the typical best friend of the main character, although he's a semi-main too, he is some real friend, have some friends like him? better cherish them, and this is a lesson though very well in this show.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nIf some might review my library of anime shows, you'd notice the pattern of the shows I'm interested in, most the gory and dark ones, with a little of comedy into it, while this is the first drama-dosed one I experience, It was more than enough to get me interested in the whole genre, I never thought I'd see a more complex love hexagon(if not a more complex shape) and enjoy it.\r\nThe episodes always end up at killer cliffhangers, I had a terrible time trying to not binge-watch the whole series, and instead take my time with it, and it did pay off at the end, but the void that's left is a hard one to get rid of.\r\nThe story kept me on my toes for the whole ride, I loved every single character for what it is, and I seriously have no complaints whatsoever, and that's rare.\n\r\n- Overall (9.3/10):\r\nGankutsuou, I guess it's time to say goodbye, I will most definitely be back for a rematch after a while, but forgetting those tragedies would take its time.\r\nfor this pint on, this would be my killer show, that I'd try and bring the numerous anime discussions and recommendations I get to participate in, all of you drama lovers out there, this is something that you'll really fall in love with, as for the viewers with affinities other than drama, this could be the show, that changes your preferences in a long time.\n"

            "content": "\n                If there is a specific level that a certain Anime have to achieve in order to be titled as a true mainstream show is getting a movie adaptation, from which a lot of newcomers can get a glance of what the show is really about and converting them into fans of the show until it comes all full circle. This is a crucial move to do as it can be the defining factor of a lot of potential fans to get in the show and many franchises fail at delivering the awaited experience. And it was about time \u201cBoku no Hero Academia\u201d made that move,and it scored like a Detroit Smash.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nA lot of Movie adaptations of already established shows, be them great or not fall short on keeping on the same track and reserving the identity of the parent show as they carry on Movie's original story, and it ends up with either creaking plot holes or being anything but the original show it stands in the shoes of.\r\nThe story of this movie feels like something you'd get on a canon arc in one of the seasons, it discusses familiar problems to the show and tackles everything carefully so as not to contradict the main story.\r\nWhat started as a fun trip to a VIP party that had all of class A present turned out to be a planned heist on a large scale that put several hostages on the vacation island in danger, until, of course, the day is saved by our boys and girls, a pretty linear and self-contained plot to sit through in an hour and a half long seat that doesn't bore you due to the great pacing that shifts the focus around so as to limit repetition and grind and take carry in the important part of the story.\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nAnd we thought some of the fights that lasted at best 10 minutes in the parent series looked this good, a movie really does bring the best quality in term of visual production.\r\nSharing the same studio as its parent series, Studio Bones, the art style didn't differ at all from what we're quite acquainted with, but we do get quite a boost in fluidity in animation, it was like upgrading from an old gen console to the latest beastly gaming computers in the market.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nThe voice acting cast behind the characters in \u201cBoku no Hero Academia\u201d have always done an exceptional job at performing the emotional and crucial moments of the story, the cries of a desperate teenager or the screams of a doomed victim, only your ear can truly appreciate.\r\nI'm very glad that the original soundtrack was still present and with an extra emphasis on how much action the movie had packed up.\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\r\nThe movie had some pretty interesting characters involved that related to All Might's backstory way back before his debut as a pro-hero which alone helped explain a lot of questions that the main story asked. Dr. David and his daughter that aspires to be a great doctor just like her father are both the first characters aside from Deku that we come to know are quirkless which puts a lot in common with our already protagonist, Deku, and these new faces that ARE a protagonist in this movie.\r\nI kind of wanted a lot of involvement from the rest of class A, but as always, Deku took all the spotlights as a jerky main character and the rest ended up being kind of neglected in comparison, going to an extent of only featuring some of them in a mere 3 seconds or less screen time, not a cool move at all.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nWatching the first movie of a great series was a blast, experiencing a new take on the show that feels like starting off fresh from zero but not at the same time, the fights were amazing and the action kept consistent all the time.\r\nThe flashbacks involving All Might are something the main story lacks the most and being able to see some of them in here was just so worth it.\n\r\nOverall (8.2/10):\r\nJust watch it, and dare I say, even if you're not caught up, it does spoil some minor details, but unless you were super attentive to the dialogue, you won't even notice, it was truly meant to be that one movie that gets people into the series without showing too much.\n"

Also, the atmosphere is a lot less serious than what we have lately if you're up to some giggles, there you go.\n"

            "content": "\n                One of the most misconception 91 Days confuses newcomers about is its false comparison with Baccano!, I'm not saying those who enjoyed Baccano! wouldn't like this one or vice versa, it's completely irrelevant to that. What I'm trying to get at is those series have less in common than they appear to be. Aside from the setting, there is nothing else of much notice to link the two.\r\nAnother common question that goes through the head of newcomers is the length of the series while heading \u201c91 Days\u201d one would easily assume the series would have 91 episodes, but no.\r\n91 Days is a 12 episodes longshort story that covers roughly 3 months, thus the 91 days, is it enough might you say? 91 days sounds more like a recap if told in 12 episodes but isn't that the same with all stories? This is a story about revenge, decisions made on bullet time speed, one flicker and years of planning might fall off. This is a story about redemption...\n\r\n- Story (8.3/10):\r\nLiving a fun happy life until the night of the massacre, Angelo witnessed the murder of his parents and younger brother at the hands of a mafia group called the Vanetti family. Making a run for it at last moment and remained silent in hiding.\r\n7 years later he was sent a message giving him the signal to start the long-planned revenge that started by him infiltrating the Vanetti family as a fresh member, climbing the ladders and taking down his family's murdered until he makes it for the top dog, the Don of the family. Along with his path to revenge, he becomes the best buddy with one of the murderers with only makes it far more emotional and hard to finish what he started. Would he disregard his feelings? would he leave everything behind and start anew? These kinds of questions happen to pass through your mind every so often while watching this show for how characters interact with one another.\r\nThe story follows a linear path, no excessive flashbacks, and no rushing through the events. The protagonist plays his moves carefully and plans further steps ahead of the viewer every moment.\r\nI really think that 91 Days stands out from other similar shows/movies with its fresh ideas that make up for the minimalistic clich\u00e9, as it draws heavily from the likes of The Godfather franchise.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nI'm very open-minded about different art styles, and one that I don't get to see very often is this generic simplistic art style that represents people from western countries the best, it goes really well with the Victorian and prohibition eras, it adds a lot of realistic feel and depth to the characters as there are no overkill eyes that seem to cover half of the face or a super Sayan hairstyle that's out of this world. Everything adds depth to the era and help convey the message.\r\nThe animation was good, above average most of the time but at its best on highlight moments, gun shootouts, knife fights, and hand to hand combat seem fluid and realistic, no over the top speed and nothing non-worldy.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI have to come straight and say this, this is one of those shows where the DUB is ways better than the SUB. Going through the prohibition era again, they absolutely nailed the accent, I had little problems with the female voice acting where it sounded very forced sometimes, but the main cast that had 90% of the show focused on them was just amazing. The soundtracks and sound effects were stunning as well, puts you in a strong mood to wearing a tuxedo and buying a luxurious classic vehicle and go for a hike on the countrysides.\r\nI'm a begger for great opening and ending theme songs, and this one didn't disappoint at all. from the same artist(s) that made Tokyo Ghoul's and Psycho-Pass' theme songs. One would argue it doesn't fit the tone of the era, but it really suited the theme of revenge with its dark tone.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThose weren't the best characters out there, but damn they weren't the least annoying, everybody was likable on their own way, aside from a few that were supposed to be disliked. They really pushed the boundaries and made you see the enemies, the people that killed the protagonist's family as humans, they feel for each other, they love, they care about their loved ones as well making you question morality in Angelo's revenge.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThere were those moments that really made me invested so much in the show I could have sworn I wanted to give this one a greater score if it weren't for some downfalls. Almost all episodes ended with a twist worthy of making you start the next episodes until you run out of them, a solid crime Anime right there.\n\r\n- Overall (8.5/10):\r\nThis one would be a hidden gem especially for The Godfather fans, it really is a solid crime show, covers a lot of historical themes and focuses on the might of mafia families and their powers, I would absolutely recommend this if you're in the mood for some old school crime thriller show.\n"

            "content": "\n                Calling Kimi no Na wa a masterpiece or something else is not even a valid argument nowadays, more than ever it's been stamped, solidified, and rendered into a fact that many people like to forget and disregard, it's a movie that got countless people into Anime and served as the neutral introduction to many, many fans of the medium. It broke records, hearts, and top-10 lists more than anyone can count and even today it remains as high ground as day one.\n\r\n- Story (9/10):\r\nProbably among all of Shinkai's works, this one has the most fleshed out and interesting plot by far. There is something verymagical and tragic about how everything was laid out from the first minute, not until the first third of the movie passed, we are still wondering about the mystery that seems to possess the consequential events, bit by bit, as you realize that things start to fall off the timeline, things happen out of the order, there is this eery vibe that drives the early part of the movie until it all hits and the supernatural element of the story unravels, by which, the intensity builds up and it's non-stop from there.\r\nWithout diving into any spoilers, the movie really takes its time building up to the climax but never does it feel slow or dragged out, even the famous clich\u00e9 Shinkai montages that highlight the passage of time are placed well and time perfectly that it gives off the perfect amount of anticipation.\n\r\n- Art (10/10):\r\nKimi no Na wa usually comes off as a benchmark when looking at something animation and art wise and it definitely did not earn this status from naught.\r\nBack in 2016, it was a phenomenon of animation achievement, no, it was magical, out of this world, and is still today nothing less than what it was on day 1, mesmerizing and inspiring through and through.\r\n Shinkai has proven himself as a master of his craft several times but it was with this movie that he broke records some of which he has set up himself and still to this day, several years later, nothing came as close as hyping up its animation to the same degree.\r\nPeople would get offended and involved in the never-ending controversies of mixing CGI with 2D animations but it was everywhere in this movie but never was it out of place or badly integrated, so much so that no one even realizes, like those meteor and stary sky scenes, just marvelous and on a league of its own. The character designs were alright, but it was the environment that took the cake.\n\r\n- Sound (10/10):\r\nAdding up to the incredible visuals, the music fidelity in this movie is just as astonishing. A lot of talent has worked in this movie but this department inspired a big part of this movie, from the top tier OSTs to the heart-felt voice acting that felt more genuine than real daily life conversations, it's a craft hard to pull off but Kimi no Na wa had all the rule of thumbs checked up from the first minute to the credits roll-up.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nA similarity that has always connected Shinkai movies was that the characters in question never carried the story but rather were carried by the flow of events too big for anyone to control. This shared universe between Makoto's stories is the true main character, sprouting several circumstances that connect nameless characters together and forms a comprehensive plot that manages to circle back on itself.\r\nThe fact that the movie is titled Your Name and the fact that the protagonists go on not knowing and/or forgetting each other's name just goes to show that they are in fact placeholder character that can be switched up easily and the story would still retain its intensity and mystery unscathed.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10):\r\nI loved sitting through this movie. I loved watching it years ago and I loved rewatching it now, just as impactful as I remember and with no signs of being dated by any measures, stilling the same old show ahead of its time in every other way, it is and will be Shinkai's masterpiece that even himself will have to surpass and it's not gonna be easy.\n\r\n- Overall (9.4/10):\r\nHonestly, for this movie to be recommended and viewed even by people who have no idea about what Anime is is reason enough to inflict curiosity and make you wanna check it out, heck, even if you've already seen it in quite some time now, it's a great idea to revisit it and look back on how your outlook on it has changed over time.\r\nI know a huge majority of people who dislike the mainstream or hate on something just for the same of hating do exist, but come on, until when are you gonna keep rejecting media that has the potential to become your favorite?\n"

Along the way, she meets various other AI who have their own dreams and missions, and she learns what it means to sing from the heart.\n\r\nThe series is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning animation, gorgeous visuals, and amazing music. The attention to detail is incredible,like how the AI skin wrinkles when they move or express emotions. The songs are catchy and beautiful, and they fit the mood and theme of each arc perfectly. The OST is also superb, with a mix of orchestral, electronic, and vocal tracks that enhance the atmosphere and tension of the scenes.\n\r\nThe action is the best part of the series, with fluid and dynamic fight sequences that showcase Vivy\u2019s skills and abilities. Vivy is not only a singer but also a fighter who can kick ass and take names. She can punch, shoot, hack, fly, and even use her voice as a weapon. She is the star of the show, and everyone else pales in comparison to her.\n\r\nThe only flaws of the series are the weak antagonists and the abrupt ending. The antagonists are mostly generic and forgettable, with vague motives and plans. They are not very threatening or interesting, and they are easily defeated by Vivy and Matsumoto. The ending is also rushed and unsatisfying, with a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions. The AIs were way too human at times, making it hard to relate to them or their struggles.\n\r\nBut these are minor issues that do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the series. Vivy: Fluorite Eye\u2019s Song is a must-watch for anyone who loves sci-fi, action, music, or cute AI girls. It is a fun and thrilling ride that will make you smile, cry, and sing along with Vivy.\n\r\nOverall:8.3/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                NOTE: Please read with caution for this review consists of several spoilers from the movie that might affect your experience with it.\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges that writers deal with when coming up with a continuation of an already concluded story is the seamless transition between old to new content. If your characters have already had their resolution, what else to write about? But in Kurko no Basket's stead, the cannon TV series' finale already felt like an interrupted sports program, and if that did not help, Sports, in general, are about the challenge rather than the destination, so inherently, the genre of this storygives free passes for limitless spin-offs or even plot expansion on demand.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nRight after the end game of the third season, a new challenge has the Generation of Miracles bond together in order to face, a foe so formidable that the all of them were required to form a one-off team of dreams to save face and pressure a group of the world-renowned street basketball team to eat their words after humiliating and talking badly about basketball in Japan. There is really no story to recognize other than a standalone intense game of Basketball, the motive behind this felt kind of forced as though the writers were looking for the slightest excuse to force this game to make happen, but the pay-off is making for all of that.\r\nThe game did not feel dragged or longer than it should, very intense and never boring with minimal dialogue and actual play. Every player on cour got to shine and show off their skills.\r\nFast forward to the end of the movie, it becomes straight up apparent that this is less of a spin-off screening and more of a real conclusion to the story as it devolves into what happens to Kagami and Kuroko and how they are planning their separate futures.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nAs if the original TV show wasn't much of eye candy already, the art style in this one is so true and more faithful to that of the Manga.\r\nThe animation doesn't fall short on delivering also, you know the key Zone moment has to have the most fluid and organic flow from frame to frame so that it looks seamless and sells the movement and speed in a more believable manner.\r\nThe use of CGI is even better and less noticeable in this movie, as they say, good 3D is the one that blends well with 2D that it's almost as if it's nonexistent.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nI think the play of the basketball is way too powerful of a visual immerse that everything else pales in compassion. My memory is kinda hazy but a beat was present there, perhaps remixes of the OSTs from the parent show as well. The voice acting was as generic as any other episode from the TV show.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI mean, the TV show has already expanded so much on the main cast, that it leaves nothing else to discuss regarding them, but somehow, Akashi's resolution find its way into this movie, and thus his split-personality finally got a good wrap up arc that was very consistent with the mini-story that plays in-parallel to the game.\r\nThe opposing team was nothing very special, the character design was cool, to say the least, however, personality-wise, they brought nothing new to the table and felt more like a placeholder for any strong team that could shake the Generation of Miracles.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.2/10):\r\nWhat a great watch it was. Non stop blood thrilling moments one after the other, literally, a fan-service movie that fulfills all the fantasies you had about the main character and all the team-ups you've ever wanted. What's even better is the rewatchability, it's insane, I was ready to jump straight back in after finishing the movie.\n\r\nOverall (8.34):\r\nThis is the types of movies that you can safely watch or show to a friend that hasn't seen any of the parent show and still get an immense sense of enjoyment out of. It's very easy to follow, doesn't really have that spoilers either, nothing too important, and really makes you in the spirit of re-watching the series again and again.\n"

The first season was a bit slow, but this time around, the show really hits the accelerator. The action is non-stop and the tension is palpable. It's like they took everything that worked in the first season and cranked it upto 11.\n\r\nOne of the standout improvements in this season is the CGI. The first season had some questionable CGI moments, but this time, it's as if they hired a whole new team of special effects wizards. It's a noticeable improvement, or maybe I just got new glasses, who knows.\n\r\nThe characters are also more fleshed out in this season. Kei is still the brooding protagonist, but his character arc takes some interesting turns. Kou Nakano, who was a bit of a bland character in the first season, finally comes into his own and becomes the comic relief of the show. He's a \"fun\" character and his scenes provide a much-needed break from the high stakes of the story.\n\r\nAnother major improvement in this season is the added focus on high-ranking government official Yuu Tosaki and his Ajin assistant Izumi Shimomura. These two add a fresh dynamic to the show and bring with them their own unique perspectives and motivations. Tosaki, in particular, provides some much-needed exposition and adds a new layer to the already complex world of Ajin.\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"Ajin Part 2, Ajin: Demi-Human 2nd Season\" is a vast improvement over the first season. It's got better pacing, improved CGI, more realized characters, and a stronger storyline. It's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the series and want to see where Kei and his crew's journey takes them. Just remember to buckle up, because this ride is about to get intense.\n\r\nOverall:8 /10.\n"

            "content": "\n                As big and strong the Attack on Titan fandom has come and always been, there has been a major celestial character favoritism battle going on for as long as the main rookie cadet squad was first introduced. Specifically, there are two major sides that you have to side with no matter what. Welcome to the Annie vs. Mikasa debate.\r\nAnd with no stretching up, both characters have their ups and downs. Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls made a huge contribution to this debate while it focuses on Mikasa and Annie on a deeper scale, presenting more information on their past and rendering them as human beingswith their own dreams, motivations, and fears.\n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nSpanning 3 episodes, Shingeki no Kyojin: Lost Girls dedicates the first two for Annie, a character that we haven't seen much of, especially on the last seasons (2 and 3 as of now), which was a total let down. The one shot takes place the day before her exposal for the titan she is, peaking on her daily routine, and it just happens to be an interesting case where she has to look for some rich man's missing daughter. They did a great job not only showing the soft and actual human part of Annie but also gave us a glimpse of the thug life on the lawless streets of Wall Maria. It seems the world inside is even more corrupt and rotten than the other side of the walls, and having a fragile girl (as she referred to herself while fighting Eren on some training flashback) take over a case that would normally exceed the qualities of a rookie such as herself puts her at a real-world challenge, both morally and faithfully. The two first episodes flow nicely and fast until you realize you already made it to the third and last episode, which is centered about Mikasa as she pictures what it would have been like if her mother and father weren't assassinated, would she still have met Eren? would they still be that close of friends? It was a bit messy and complicated if you don't pay enough attention as they timeline conflicts can really confuse you, I didn't sign up for Steins;Gate class complicated shows, but I was shocked nevertheless.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nThe animation in Attack on Titan was always a core key, and a great one might I add. Everybody would go praising how fluid and fantastic the visuals are, but honestly, not so much with this one. And I can excuse that for there were minimal action scenes to focus on. The art style was normal, but well maintained and consistent throughout the OVA, never lazy or blunt. I would argue that the \u201cNo Regrets\u201d OVA had better flexing on the animation, but that's another talk for another day. But don't give up, the two or three satisfying punches do take a thing or two from that glorious cake of an animation.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nI really appreciate their choice of ending theme songs, the first two, there was an original ending song with both visuals and sound, focusing of course on Annie and her outsider friends. But what really added nostalgia to the mix was the return of the fantastic ending theme song of Mikasa from the first season of the parent series. The voice acting was great, again, Attack On Titan's cast was always great on this one. Unfortunately, there wasn't any opening theme song to start off the hype, but it isn't always necessary.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThis is what kept the OVA going, Annie had some great focus, the spotlight brought out the best out of her and gave us some deep insight into her life, and some sneaky peaks on her backstory. Before this, I really didn't give Annie many credits and wasn't even one of my top favorite characters in the series, but this was a rank-changer for her to me. Unfortunately, Mikasa's episode wasn't as deep as Annies, it didn't add anything special, to be honest, we already knew plenty about her, she only seemed to display even more affection to Eren.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nMost definitely, my second favorite OVA of the series after \u201cNo Regrets\u201d, I enjoyed the heck out of what Annie had to offer, but not much with Mikasa's. There are in fact few intriguing moments with Mikasa, making her as sort of having some mysterious supernatural powers, they did it before and here they are back with it strong.\n\r\n- Overall (7.4/10):\r\nIf you're either of both characters fan (which you should be), you should give this a try, especially for you Annie lovers, it's for her, more than a just irrelevant episode because they manage to tell more about her than the entire series did so far.\n"

It sorts of reminds me of WIT's art style more than it does MAPPA's. Maybe it's that spark or nostalgic familiarity that made this so endearing to me.\n\r\nVisuals aside, the jokes delivered on every episode were a batch of hilarious parody commentaryon what was otherwise a pretty brutal and harsh portion of the story, it made a well-put comedy picture of the whole thing and I couldn't help but grin the entirely of time watching this.\n"

It's like they were trying to see how much punishment their audience could take before completely giving up on the show altogether.\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the fact that theseepisodes were a minute each.

If I had to sit through any more of this mind-numbing drivel, I think I would have ended up causing myself some serious harm. So, thank you, creators, of this show, for sparing us a little bit of agony with these one-minute episodes.\n"

            "content": "\n                Both an anime and an accurate depiction of the real world, Inuyashiki, a 11 episodes long show (there was a dark pun on episode 9 behind this odd number of episodes) full of real-world references and irony from the same creator of the massively successful series, GANTZ, that doesn't fall short on delivering the same amount of twisted and dark turnouts every episode. Filled with superheroism treats, but unlike One Punch Man and Boku no Hero Academia, this one helps itself to be as twisted and straight to the point than the last two mentions for what it holds of emotion and threats as itmanaged to dive into the more prominent psychological problems, what makes one a hero and the other a villain.\r\nAgain, something I mention in most of my reviews, but more with this one. I think the R (+17) rating labeling this series could never be well placed, there are extreme gore and more importantly sexual content in here. To what degree? well, naked women and men are very common, having conversations and that state. If that wasn't enough, they even go hardcore with a dude forcing another one to give him a blowjob, ugh. That aside, let's hit the keyboard and discuss some of the show's most prominent aspects.\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\r\nIchirou Inuyashiki, an old guy in his 50s (with a grandpa look like he's in his 80s or something) is living through the worst phase of his life, suffering from liver cancer, surrounded with angry family members that don't seem to give the guy a breather at all happens to get exposed to some mysterious extraterrestrial figures that turn his into a super advanced robot capable of destroying the earth. At the same moment, another guy happened to be passing by that got the same powers, Hiro Shishigami, a role model highschooler that seems to spend his days with his otaku friend Ando reading Manga all day long.\r\nThe story focuses on this two main protagonists who are antagonists of each other go through using their newly acquired powers in opposing manners, one saves people, the other murders them. All the events of the story move at a considerably fast pace that never lets you complain how boring the show is (which definitely is not). Propos to the direction team for handling the transitions between the two protagonists smoothly and this well.\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\r\nGenerally speaking, the art style this series has chosen to stick to is amazingly stunning and fits very well serious stories like this one. I loved how realistic character faces and expressions were like, no over-exaggerated eye sizes, no crazy Anime hairstyles, nothing of that. Most of the characters are actually ugly or average looking, sad truth, but most people in the real world are.\r\nSeeing how this show is labeled as an action thriller, it doesn't fall short of shinning at fast fluid movements on all of the fights, lasers shooting and superspeed flying has never looked so fluid. The art style is depicted in a way that makes it blend with 3D animations very easily looking at how it relies on 3D animations most of the time because how often complex mechanic transformation happens. I'm fine with the CGI usage in this show's case, it doesn't bother me 80% of the time, but God, at one scene it looked so awful I couldn't even keep looking without having painful flashbacks of those shitty 3D games of the 2000 that barely even run on the highly capable PS1 of the era.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nNow, this is a series full of massacres, so it's natural to get to hear screams, people freaking out... I think that the voice acting cast did that job perfectly (talking about the SUB here), some performances even left me trembling from shivers, the fear of the voices was only complimented by the crazy realistic ugly faces that come with it. And don't even get me started on the opening and ending themes songs. Those were so marvelous pieces of music, you get the hyped up opening to get you reading to start savage episodes, and then a calm ending theme song to help let the feels flow looking at how often you'll get to tear up at the end of each episode.\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\r\nMost of the shows can screw up this part really easily with annoying or unrealistic characters, but Inuyashiki not only takes places on a real-time setting but also brings up relatable human beings that makes you go, Oh, I could be on that guy's shoes. Also, the two main characters are one of the finest there are. First, we have Ichirou, an old dude who's lived most of his life as a casual citizen, acting good, working, a family type of guy, then he gets exposed to a greater fate than he could have ever dreamed off seeing how he never was the type of popular dude in his entire life. Never be the guy to hit on girls or be the center of the spotlights. Makes you think he would take advantage of his new powers to relive the things he missed, but his old age, wiseness, and experience of the world made him think of the powers as a means to save people, a blessing from the Gods that he has to act good with. And then you get the edgy hot high school boy, still in his rebellious days with nobody to guide him that easily began murdering people just because he was bored, and simply because he could. Very people with the same fate but lacking what their counterpart has.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\r\nI always slack off finishing my shows, but Inuyashiki was a different story. I know there are being that can finish off 11 episodes on one setting, and I used to be one, but not anymore, my desire to follow up with the story lead me to finish the whole thing in 2 days sessions even though my time is super limited, if they didn't screw up the CGI parts sometimes, it would have been one of the greatest shows of its kind. Other than that, it was super exciting to know what happens next at the end of every episode, something that rarely ever happens to me. One other thing was the excessive references to One Piece and its Mangaka Eiichiro Oda, God bless him.\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\r\nWell, I tend to rewatch my favorite shows with my family 90% of the time, but unfortunately, not with this one. I'm mostly fine with minimal partial sexual references, have it be as gory as you want, but just don't over sexual the thing, and I'll be fine sharing it with family. Inuyashiki, unfortunately, crossed some lines there and went extremely at one point. But still, if you're on your own and don't mind sexual content, this series will have its effects on you. Buckle up and get some tissues ready though, this is one action centered show that will hit you emotionally as hard as those invisible bullets they shoot.\n"

I might even put some of the episodes from the original 90's series above most of the feature shots, but still good enough not to distract and immerse you out of the experience.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nI don't know how they messed it up, but everything audio-related feels like it's playing out of a 30 yo junky radio with more dust than passion.\r\nIt's not bad, maybe it helps up with the aesthetic, but it's far from amazing, maybe a tad below decent. The voice acting itself is fine, especially Vash's and Wolfwood's Seiyuus, I can't speak for the rest.\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\r\nThe movie was never focused on the main characters, but rather follows the revenge ordeal of two different parties that were anything but impressive. Amelia felt like a placeholder for any other avenger while Gasback had most the most depth to him that he felt like the real protagonist, but faith had it that he got featured in the wrong show.\r\nVash and gang are always a fun group, but they felt like a third party being involved in someone else's story.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nSurprisingly, I enjoyed this way more than I anticipated.\r\nMaybe the characters and the story were not that captivating to me, however, the setting felt like the most alive element of the whole movie, I love how crowded and dusty the environment was, how busy and loud the streets were, different conversations from left to right, it was truly a character of its own. I don't know what it is princely, but something felt very nosta&lgic and close to more than anything else in this movie, and that much I appreciate dearly. This is going to be a definitive rewatch.\n\r\nOverall(7.7/10):\r\nI would shove off this movie in the face of everyone, even if they never heard of Trigun, perhaps, it would be the right call to introduce them to the show, it captures what Trigun really is about, well, the cheerful non-dark side but that's good enough. A very easy movie to gloss through and still understand every bit of dialogue, the comedy is on point, the character interactions are amazing and the setting alone is deserving of giving this movie a watch.\n"

Not only one of if not the most consumed genre in this medium, but also ar the easiest to relate to, with a large target audience that cherishes the fictional high school experience (We all went to the wrong high school apparently).\r\nThat was the most generic intro I could start this up with, but it has less to do with \u201cBokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai\u201d (quite a mouthful) or the busy, \u201cWe never learn\u201d. Mainly because of how hard it tried to distinguish itself from what we get every season. Long story short, It did payoff.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nAt its very core, \u201cWe never learn\u201d has one of the most basic stories that goes about a guy unconsciously raising a harem of girls from his high school, only this time around, there were no superpowers involved, no faith of humanity at risk, just a select of concerned passionate students that want to excel at what they do, with a great emphasis of comedy and goof-offs.\r\nNariyuki, a hard-working student tasked by the principle to tutor a duo of geniuses in his high school on materials that they're respectively bad at. The science genius red-head Ogata that wants to grasp a grip on literature, and the bookworm blue-head Fumino that wants to pursue a career in the scientific field. A short and a tall one, a flat and a garden-of-melons one (you get the idea), and trust me, the contrasts between them are much deeper.\r\nOf course, with time, other girls join in, Takemoto the athletic idol of the high school (Team Takemoto for the win by the way) and a couple of others, of which was the blessing of the season, enter, the almighty TILF, teacher Mafuyu.\r\nIt all starts genius and study-centered until the romance and pairings kick-off, and oh boy were day never-wreaking (in a good way)\r\nI find it genius how the show aired at the exact universal period of exams probably to relate to as much audience as possible. Aside from the main story that goes about the harem, the nostalgic atmospheric school vibes were too strong, the last time an Anime made me miss being a student was \u201cAnsatsu Kyoushitsu\u201d or \u201cAssassination Classroom\u201d. You get to feel their youth on both naive moments and not.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\n2019 feels like a weird year for animation. A lot of studios given us the unexpected, there was a lot of disappointment for some as well. But \u201cWe never learn\u201d didn't partake in none of those.\r\nPresented with the most generic slice-of-life-y art style that's good enough to keep you watching without complaint. Probably the best thing it had going for it visually was the consistency of the production. No episodes felt visually inferior, what you're used to is what you get, fair and simple.\r\nThe character design is just as average as the overall artboard, but the artistic choices are taken to influence said characters are striking, for example, a unique color that identifies every character based on their personality and mood. The proportion of the body is also a clever play on portraying everyone's treats.\r\nI don't like the direction they went with Nariyiki specifically, giving him the dull appearance with the very uninspiring brown aesthetic (talking mainly about the hair and eye color), but maybe that was the catch? He seemed like the center of the story to me, at least give him more of a better highlight.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nI really got invested so much into the cast of voice actors and actresses, so much in fact that I can't imagine any other sound when I see the characters' faces.\r\nTakemoto's voice actress Suzushiro Sayumi is a fairly unpopular voice actress compared to most others, with very few roles in her experience, but God, her performance was a blast.\r\nThe opening song strikes a vibe of its own, making you feel like pulling off a high school material book and pretend you are preparing for an important exam in a group study at a summery day, it's just so surreal.\r\nThe ending theme song was not looking at the same direction as the opening, quite the change with a distinguishable tone and a more energetic pace, really well done too.\n\r\n- Character (7/10):\r\nI'm not as happy with this one as I would have loved to.\r\nDon't get me wrong, the characters are all unique individuals with their own stories to tell, but at what catch?\r\nIf anything, there was a huge lackluster in fleshing out the characters. They all received proper self-defining arcs, next episode, it feels like nothing was achieved.\r\nMost of the characters go through such length and bring out a new side and new thesis to tackle, but then it's like, \u201cnext\u201d, good o'l switch a roo...\r\nWhat I'm trying to get to is, it's fine if you had a slow progressive story if you're going to sacrifice that to a more in-depth character arc that leaves its mark in the later episode. Now that I'm thinking about it, the only thing that changes is their level of affection to the main character, which is excusable for this show's case, but what about their dreams they keep bringing out?  Their past? Anything, please.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10):\r\nI really had a blast, as short as I can phrase it.\r\nProbably one of the best Rom-Coms I watched, it did better than \u201cKaguya-sama love is war\u201d in some aspects, and worst at others, both are great shows.\r\nIt's exactly the kind of show that makes me go \u201cI want an OVA asap, or maybe a sequel if you're generous enough\u201d.\r\nI don't think I'll be able to remember every name or every character in this show, but the hilarious moments and quotes shall forever be remembered.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nThis is a really easy show to get into, definitely, a binge-watch material, even though I only experienced it in a weekly fashion.\r\nIf you're looking for a Rom-Com, you can start right off the bat and with no regrets, a lot of hilarious moments in the waiting, glorious misunderstood setups, and likable characters.\r\nThe main character doesn't make you spit slurs up every second, it feels like a chill series you'd want to watch after a long day of work in order to relax. Nothing beats the good old days of high school.\n"

            "content": "\n                Probably the most disappointing modern adaptation to date, both Anime only watchers and Manga hardcore fans that claim the source material to be a masterpiece, all have turned their back on the abomination that one body could take for granted, \u201cTokyo Ghoul:re\u201d, with the prequel being just as controversially bad, this sequel of the same name told us to hold its beer, and that wasn't even half of the story.\r\nI'm an Anime-only watcher, I never read a single chapter of the Manga, and never was exposed to any of the \u201cspoilers\u201d you see being spammed on the internet.\r\nNevertheless, and given both recent adaptations, they remainone of the worse comebacks ever, at least in my experience.\n\r\nStory (3/10):\r\nJust like the prequel, and even more, the pacing was ridiculously fast, even my Manga reader sibling commented on how fast and confusing it was, let alone for Anime-only watcher normie me that had no idea on the chronological order of anything that happened in the season, literally, they go from one period of time worth of content to another with no alert, and it isn't a bad thing to do per se (Baccano! is a great example on how to accomplish that the right way), they themselves made it not work somehow.\r\nThe progression as well as poor and bad-received from my part, I was basically starting at the screen trying to figure out what was the meaning of what's happening, it felt more like a chore than actual entertainment.\r\nAside from the bad direction, the story, in general, fell by a great margin in terms of quality, and I can see the potential there, a lot of turn around moments and twists didn't have such impact, and most were forced and out of nowhere, like you'sd have episodes houses up to five or six big reveals, and none of them gives the other a moment of breather to tone down the intensity, no, it was more like a global traffic accident. Like, what is a Kagune anymore?\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nProbably the only decent aspect that \u201cTokyo Ghoul:re 2\u201d has going on other than the vocals.\r\nAnd even that wasn't for the most part, there are the big moments of shine that have a noticeable rise in quality, but almost the majority of animation was just a lazy bad move from their part, most talking about the distorted anatomy and the slow movements on scenes that were supposed to feel faster.\r\nI do give them one thing though, and that is the backgrounds, so realistic and do standout on their own and yet make a great job blending in the other not-too-realistic characters, and it works flawlessly.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nSee that eight? That's talking mostly about the opening theme song alone, Katharsis gave me a new aura to associate Tokyo Ghoul with. As much of an iconic Unravel was, I just can't help but give Katharsis the crown that Unravel held for so long, it just works perfectly, especially for a story with the same atmosphere as Tokyo Ghoul.\r\nThe voice acting, on the other hand, wasn't my proudest experience here, a lot of screaming was involved, and you know how bad that can get.\r\nToo bad they did not bring back some of the old soundtracks along, like the fantastic \u201cGlassy Sky\u201d. Just why did they think changing to something new would work better?\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\r\nA true shame, I do believe that Tokyo Ghoul had some of the greatest characters, that is until the \u201c:re\u201d adaptation joined the chat. There is particularly no sense in dealing with something called \u201ccharacter development\u201d in this shitfest of colliding misfits.\r\nIf anything, that was an intentional downgrade, the interesting Kaneki for instance, goes from his raging emo depression to a normie nerdy looking guy, to then out of the blue breaking the emo records once again, and all of that in the same episode, bruh, catch a breather, will ya?\r\nAgain, they went with the biggest weakness of the prequel and introduced a ton of other characters that we never got any background about, more specifically, think about it like crowd characters with names that they keep shaving up in your face the entire episode.\r\nThere were a lot of interesting backstories with huge potential, but they just didn't live up to my expectations, with the return of some characters we long thought were dead, and the death of many others, sense loses its meaning and you end up not giving any L's.\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):\r\nBasically, when you're too into some Anime that you don't enjoy anymore, but still dedicate some time to watching it for the sake of completing it, and I'm a completionist as I like to call myself, if it sucks, I'll rant in the review.\r\nI did, however, experience one of my new favorite songs, Katharsis, that's probably the only good thing I'll remember about this adaptation, it really does feel bad, how such a big renowned series like this, gets such a low-level conclusion, even after a long time of wait from us fans.\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\r\nSo glad I went through this, and so sad at the same time for how bad it was. If you're already planning to watch this, chances are you made it through the first three seasons, and only this abomination is still standing between you and saying \u201cI watched Tokyo Ghoul\u201d.\r\nIt's adaptations like this that make you appreciate how great shows like \u201cAttack on Titan\u201d and \u201cMy Hero Academia\u201d have it, I'm not trying to steer any controversy here, if you like your Tokyo Ghoul, then nobody is stopping you from seeing this season, again, I'm just stating my opinion, and it's far from being a fact.\n"

Cover your ears and let them bark and go on with your life.\n\r\nPeople get salty too quickly, and over nothing, worst-case scenario, they paid a lifestreaming service to watch this season alone, but we know it's already much more peaceful than that.\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is gonna My Hero Academia, what did you expect? When has the show done anything else in 4 seasons prior? Thefirst half of the season is a decent display of Class 1-A vs. Class 1-B, decent, at times even great, such a good time competing over something wholesome, what more do you need?\r\nRight after, we get more exposition about the Todoroki family, from where I thought the show really picked up. It was delivered beautifully, showing both Endeavor and his family's perspectives.\r\nAnd then, there was the fabled My Villain Academia, it was on par with the best parts of the whole franchise.\n\r\nThe animation stepped up when it needed to do so, it was great, dynamic, lively, and full of energy. The Voice acting too did not shy from delivering on the full emotional impact that was delivered.\n\r\nI genuinely say, as a far from being a fan of the franchise, and as a casual My Hero Academia watcher, this was a lot of fun. We get a mini-tournament, a character exposition, and then twist after twist. Oh, did I even mention, the whole thing starts off by dropping one of the biggest twists in the series? There you go.\n\r\nOverall, that's an easy 8.4/10 season, watch it for yourself and judge, and don't stress over other people's bashful opinions, although,; you could say I'm also being bashful of other people's opinions about the show. I hope this does not come up as a rant, if it did, Apologies.\n"

I don'tspeak Japanese, so obviously I can't make out what the song is about just by listening to it, but I can clearly make out the mood it delivers, however, seeing the animation peered with it opens up new doors, visuals, the most ancient universal language. I grew loving \u201cVeil\u201d much more and it enabled me to check out more stuff from the same artist. Well, that was for the first feature episode, the second and last one (primarily labeled as the third episode until much later) fell under the trailer-esque bait luring you into yet another franchise that I'll refrain from talking about, but the song deliberately calls out for investing it the shoutout entry.\n"

It even went as far as surpassing the very ceiling it set up with its previous season and movie in a single seasonal screening like no other Anime before.\n\r\nHate it as much as you want, but Demon Slayer has risen to be THE quality unit of measurement that will likelybe used objectively for years to come, and it's far from being done.\n\r\nFor me personally, my leanest grip on the franchise is how weak and uninteresting the overarching plot of Demon Slayer is. It's the simplest form of quest storylines that have a clear starting and ending point, no strings attached, not even any detours are made in the pursuit of the final goal of healing Nezuko, however, it can be a good thing also, as it doesn't distract away from what they story really is about. It's a linear story at its very core and a decent one at that.\n\r\nI must really step up here and admit, that for the longest time, I've dreaded 99% of the entire characters of this series. Every one of them feels like a case of \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d, only, a massively downgraded version of that. However, this season was the trigger than set my view on these characters afresh. Even characters that I hated to love before, e.g Zenitsu, have massively stepped up in ranking after this arc. Not to mention, Tengen, one of the characters I cared the least about (The Hashirah) quickly became of the coolest characters introduced in this show.\n\r\nNow, for the cream of the crop. The animation was just. Cathartic, I seriously can't come up with a good enough word that really puts it into perspective, but then again, an image is a thousand words, but every frame of this masterclass was a world-renounced painting, light years ahead from being just an image. It was one of the shows that really innovated on top of what it already innovated just 2 years ago. Even the faintest action-related moments had so much soul and character put into them, and don't get me started on how dynamic the camera felt. The entertainment arc not only did it live up to its name thematically, but also literally, it was folds and layers of hype and raw Shounen entertainment, every episode built on top of the last's cliffhanger and there was never a slow, dull, or breather moment. A show that was a blast watching weekly, and would even rise up to a higher status on a binge-watch.\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                In most classic Anime conversations, there is always that one show that gets mentioned as a secondary fallback for the big names such as Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and peers, a show that felt so daring and popular and yet very often forgotten.\n\r\nTrigun might be the shy skinny kid called Timmy, but when you're at Timmy's, he is not afraid to show you why he is part of the big classic hits from the 90s.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nI wasn't ready.\r\nI wasn't ready in the sense of knowing very little about what I was getting myself into. A glimpse of the poster of the show sells itout as a retro cowboy action drama, and then for the good amount of 12 or 15 episodes, the show was heavy on light-hearted comedy with subtle hints to a deeper story that never crossed my mind.\n\r\nThe setting of the story is very eery, to be honest, you would be invested, laughing with both hands on your stomach at the Swifty jokes and setups that Vash finds himself involved in, but the clues on what is actually happening are always in front of your eyes, and until it is verbally revealed, you just don't notice that you are in the presence of a very dark and tragic tale of self-discovery and pursuing idealistic beliefs.\n\r\nThe show makes a very good attempt at separating the comedy and tragedy and Vash is a perfect vassal for that. However, the shift in atmosphere and tension can be almost instantaneous, more than not, you'd be confused about how you should react to a mass genocide amid of a hysterical laugh, like when, how and who is that pulling up all the stops?\n\r\nArt (7.5/10):\r\nI feel, even compared to similar shows, the animation has known a degree of age. Maybe it's a matter of resolution, but talking about the aesthetics is an entirely different matter. It's got that martian survival cowboy epic feel, I know it's a strange and incohesive mashup, but until you sit through it, it's a genre opening opportunity that unfortunately has not been taken full advantage of. The characters have a strong 90s mark to them, with pale colors and typical Sh\u014djo eyes.\n\r\nSound (7.8/10):\r\nThe vocals were amazing, from opening to ending songs, and the OST collection that span throughout the run, it is the typical score that would stick with you for years to come, something that you will definitely feel nostalgic about even when hearing it for the first time for some reason.\r\nThe voice acting really grows on you, at first, I had a questionable stance on how some key characters did not match up well with their voices, but a couple of episodes in, they feel so natural that you're glad they sound the way they do because their voices reflect more on their personality than their appearance.\r\nOne very small thing that I really love and like to point out is the note that plays mid-episode, something like a guitar stroke, I don't know why but that alone represents the whole epic perfectly.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nIf there was anything this show does right, it's the characters. I love Vash, but not only him, Meryl, Milly, and Nicholas, but all four main characters are also just as good. Of course, some do not show those qualities early on, for example, Meryl, she starts up as the typical annoying lousy girl that trashes Vash every chance she has, and eventually changes completely after undergoing her personal character development, the same with Vash, Milly and even Nicholas who joins the ride later on.\n\r\nKnives is an interesting villain too, him and his group \u201cThe Gung-Ho-Guns\u201d, although they played minimal roles on the individual level, they were more present as a group rather than individuals. Despite note being present for most of the run, Knives, or at least his influence was always present, his ideology shines from the very first episode to the last, rival Vash's and what he stands for.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.2/10):\r\nExpecting an epic battle action story, I found myself gauging in laughter more often than not for the better half of the series, I had a good time doing just that and I was fine with it until the story started shifting to something darker and more contrasting to the real world, I knew I was undergoing something much more meaningful, and it was phenomenal. Some episodes made up my top 10 list of all-time when I could least expect it even. I really got attached to the character, I got invested in the lore, it felt by the end of the series, I wished if there was more material to consume, lucky for me, there is a movie still in the waiting.\n\r\nOverall (7.7/10):\r\nNo wonder it is a classic show. A show that has to be recommended more I think. It is the typical show that requires a slow following, I don't think it's the type of shows you would binge in one sitting, because it has a strong semi-episodic progression, every episode takes its time and builds upon the past ones. Take it easy, at your own pace, it is best enjoyed at a slower pace in my opinion. It has the perfect amount of comedy, drama, and action, and I would say, both great to watch alone and with company.\n"

            "content": "\n                Just imagine over several thousand of years had passed, the human race would have gone extinct ages ago, and the wildlife had taken control over once again, some form of life descended to earth, and discovered the Disney park, now wouldn't they think we human, the previous residents of earth were worshiping Micky mouse, regarding him as a mighty god? well, what would happen if they were to get a copy of the Pingu in the city series? now that would be something to be looking for, wouldn't it? but seriously guys, the series that emerged from our dark nature of memes, and gained mostof its popularity from that is our focus for this review, I won't lie when I say, I picked up interest in this show just to take part of the meme community, and was greeted with a whole different experience when watching it.\r\nThis is going to be, an honest and an unbiased review of the series, \u201cPingu in the city\u201d.\n\r\n- Story (6/10):\r\nThe score in here varies from a person to another, I'm sure if someone else, younger than I am, would have given it a slightly higher score, but as for me, -the viewer, it felt like an easy 6 on the scale of ten, the story, while not completely dull, it follows our protagonist, a young male Penguin called, well, you guessed it, \u201cPingu\u201d, that goes through his daily life, having fun sometimes, probably working hard in others, struggling like the average kids would. The story focuses more on his relationships with his family and friends, It's very wholesome and family friendly, and honestly, geared more towards a younger audience.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nNothing very remarkable or outstanding, it's done all in CG, and surprisingly enough, taking in consideration the context, it's not that bad, you would typically see big-time shows screwing up the CG moments, but not this one. nothing is too overkill or anything, which really helps keep up the peaceful kind of atmosphere to the environment of the story.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nLong have people complained about the lack of subtitles in this one, but honestly, why would you need any? the whole time, the characters are screaming nonsense, literally, some form of complex jibberish, and on fewer occasions, they would yield \u201cNoot Noooot\u201d very awkwardly, and yet, there is zero misunderstanding when it comes to following the characters' dialogs and interactions, the opening and ending are very, very simple, but do they stick to your memory that easy.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nWhat I really loved about this show, is how consistent the main cast is, who said only shows with lots of characters are successful? we don't see many familiar faces, because first, they are all penguins, and look similar to one another, and second, even though the city is so big, everyone seemed to know each other, outside of Pingu's family (which is one of 4 members), you have few of Pingu's friends and close relatives, and that's it. the show is typical, self-centered around Pingu, because, duh, he's the protagonist, but it's his everyday life that makes the cast wider by margins compared to the first episode.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7/10):\r\nTrying to sum this one up, I'd say, I liked the show, I didn't love it nor did I hate it, simply had watched a decent show, where I didn't have a lot of things to complain about (which by the way would find me doing on even the most credible and popular well-written stories), if you overlooked the fact that it looks very childish, it's a really decent show to watch on your spare time.\n\r\n- Overall (7/10):\r\nWow, even I am surprised that this lived up to be worth 7 out of 10 at this point, I'm not going to introduce a lot of people to this show, but for the ones who want something wholesome, here's your pick.\n"

            "content": "\n                The world of anime can often be an eclectic mix of artistic innovation and boundary-pushing storytelling, and \"FLCL: Grunge\" embodies this spirit to the fullest. Yet another reboot to the iconic \"FLCL\" series, but wait, this isn\u2019t our first rodeo, and boy were they so bad in the past, however, \"Grunge\" takes the franchise's trademark weirdness and stylishness to a whole new level.\n\r\nRight from the get-go, \"FLCL: Grunge\" throws you into the deep end with its unconventional use of 3D animation. While 3D animation in anime can be a polarizing element, it works surprisingly well here. The controversial choice is controversial for a reason, butin this case, it adds a unique layer of stylistic innovation that complements the series' themes.\n\r\nThe story unfolds in a city marred by decline and poverty, where adults have given up hope for a brighter future. A perfect for the series\u2019s iconic coming-of-age setups. In this bleak setting, the youth have come to accept this as their ordinary reality. That is until Haruko, the iconic character from the original series, comes crashing in, throwing the city into chaos.\n\r\nOne of the most captivating aspects of \"Grunge\" is its striking and unique art style. The 3D animation is paired with a cacophony of cartoony and cool sound effects, creating a visual and auditory experience that's unlike anything else in the anime world. This creative decision is both controversial and brilliant, pushing the boundaries of traditional anime aesthetics.\n\r\nWhat's particularly intriguing is the narrative structure. The events of the three episodes offer different perspectives on the same storyline, a clever device that keeps the viewer engaged and provides a deeper understanding of the characters. This approach adds layers of complexity to the plot, keeping you on your toes.\n\r\n\"FLCL: Grunge\" introduces a different version of Haruko, and it's a refreshing take on a beloved character. This fresh interpretation adds a new layer of intrigue to the series, particularly for fans of the original \"FLCL.\"\n\r\nThe nostalgia factor plays a significant role here, with The Pillows returning to provide the show's soundtrack. Their music serves as a throwback to the original series, striking chords of fond memories for long-time fans.\n\r\n\"FLCL: Grunge\" defies expectations and stereotypes. It's a bold and innovative take on a beloved classic, and it doesn't shy away from pushing the boundaries of animation and storytelling. If you're a fan of the \"FLCL\" universe or just appreciate anime that dares to be different, this installment is sure to leave you pleasantly surprised and longing for more.\n\r\nOverall: 8.48/10.\n"

I don't know why it's not stated anywhere on this page, but this highlights movie features half of season two, heavy with plot spoilers that should be avoided until you watch the second season. Which that out of the way, let's start.\n\r\nSay in short, this is a highlights compilation that follows the two games against Aomine from season one and season two, and as we know, the games span multiple episodes and a movie format is just the perfect take on how to screen one of them. No commercialbreaks in between, no constant interruption of the opening and ending theme songs, you just get the raw content ported directly from the TV show, bundled together in a seamless way that recaps you on one of the best games from the show.\n\r\nI appreciate the original opening that came with this, the song was alright however the visuals were just stunning. You could tell from that alone that more effort went into this than simply piecing together recycled scenes.\n"

The world felt bigger and more fleshed out, the characters were even more intriguing and their interactions were top-notch. So, when Overlord III rolled around, I had high expectations. While it was still a good experience, it was slightly under what I was expecting. The previous season set the bar high, and while this one didn't quite reach that level, it still offered plenty of great moments and exciting plot developments.\n\r\nOne of thebiggest strengths of the Overlord franchise has always been its world-building and this season continued that trend. We learned even more about the various factions and characters in the world, and their motivations and desires were made even clearer. The battles and conflicts were also intense, and the animation was top-notch as always.\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't say that Overlord III was a disappointment, it did fall slightly short of my expectations. That being said, it's still a must-watch for fans of the franchise and those who love anime in the fantasy genre. If you're already invested in the world of Overlord, you'll find plenty to love in this season. But if you're just starting out, you might want to start with the earlier seasons first.\n\r\nOverall: 7.56/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                You'd think some of the best arcs in any show tend to be redemption arcs, but the fact of the matter, Black Clover's entire run was a redemption arc on display. What started as ear torture that everyone would make fun of and label as Shounen trash came overboard and forced everyone to eat their words, becoming their very own favorite Anime of all time and it is still far from finished.\r\nWhat was announced first as a 13 episodes series quickly became 51 and kept on increasing its deadline until it inevitably concluded on a magnificent run of 170 episodes in more than a 3years production with minimal breaks and filler, for a long-running show, it achieved what every other show fails at.\n\r\nStory (8.5/10):\r\nI'm a Manga reader, so I know and can confirm that as a fact, the Black Clover story is nowhere near its conclusion, and from the content that's present in the Manga but is still not adapted YET in the Anime, as a whole, the story is first class, full of satisfying deliveries and revelations that tie everything full-circle, but for the sake of this review, I'm only going to discuss the story up to the point the Anime was concluded.\r\nTwo boys one dream, a classic Shounen tale that has been done so many times than I can count with every series throwing its special ingredient to the mix, however, not every series successes in resulting with its own original thing, and most fall under the trap of overly saturated blueprint that's easy to predict and hard to be impressed by. Perhaps Black Clover was just that in the beginning, but the more you watch, and the more you learn about the world of the story, the more you realize that even at the earlier episodes it was completely its own thing, separated from your typical Shounen as everything lines up perfectly until it all clicks and makes sense. Not every arc is equal, but at the end of the day, in most of the adapted episodes, the majority of the arcs fall under the same Saga which ties things together and makes up for the slower arcs that are not as impressive when looking at them from a standalone perspective.\r\nThe Anime in particular suffers from painfully slow pacing at some parts, I can't come up with any excuses for that but it only proves the greatness of this show, overcoming even that back draw and keeping you hooked week after week. \n\r\nArt (7.8/10):\r\nThis is a hard one for me, if anything the show sucks at is keeping up a consistent animation and art direction. While some of the most important episodes look world-class in terms of visuals, many scenes can look hot garbage even compared to dated shows from decades ago, again, giving the staff the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure there was no slacking but tight deadlines and a lower budget.\r\nCharacter designs, it's very distinct and memorable. Tabata sensei's art has such a unique vibe with pointy chins and well-defined eyes, it looks like a mix of Bleach and a 90's Shoujo, a match that I never thought about, let alone like.\n\r\nSound (8.5/10):\r\nIf anything, Black Clover is known most for its very amazing selection of opening and ending theme songs. Even non-fans can openly agree on that. For a show with 13 openings and none of them to be below great is a feat in and of itself. A controversial opinion that has been cursing the franchise for so long is Asta's voice. For it to make even Bakugo haters diminish their criticism, Asta must have surely been one loud fella.\r\nThe truth of the matter, I never noticed, but many people swear by it, however, 10 or so episodes in, many confirm that it's never there. The Seiyuu behind Asta was new to the medium, still in learning but he got himself figure out, and what was just Asta shouting loudly became a source of hype and emotion that gives you shivers when you hear it later.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nBlack Clover is very rich character-wise. It introduces so many characters and keeps them relevant enough for everyone to enjoy, to the point that you find yourself memorizing countless names and having no problem recollecting and distinguishing between them, making you sub-consciously connect with them.\r\nBlack Clover's take on the protagonist's rival has always been one of my favorite things of the show, Yuno, someone who appears to be your typical Sasuke clone, very edgy, popular with the ladies, and talented beyond believe turns out to be a very supportive and faithful friend since day one. When it's time to battle, it's not only Asta and Yuno, no, everyone partakes, male and female, friend and foe, all contribute within the boundaries of the arc.\r\nOf course, how could we forget Yami, one of the most popular characters from recent Shounen, the dude is a straight-up retire Anime protagonist at this point.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10):\r\nTo me, Black Clover was more than just a weekly Anime I had to look forward to every Tuesday, it has accompanied me through the last 3 years through a very important transition in my life, the show thus became closer to me and impactful on my real-life decision, it could not achieve that on a whim, it had something special to it, something like a family bond between the cast, perhaps that's the magic that drew me in and kept me involved this entire run. It might have been clich\u00e9 and predictable, but that quickly changes with each turn of events, especially nearing the climax of the first Saga which spanned from episode 1 to episode +120. Also, the idea of grimoires always sounded cool to me.\n\r\nOverall (8.46/10):\r\nHey you, reading this and hesitating not to watch Black Clover, here's a word from me. No, it's not Fairy Tail, and it's not Naruto either, it might look like it is, but trust me the story pulls you in, if not, the characters will do. Watching through and following feels very easy and natural, almost like reading a personal diary, it does not try to be the next Attack on Titan, it knows its boundaries but it doesn't shy from experimenting with the genre either. At the end of the day, I was here, I watch Black Clover, and it's your turn to do so too. Have fun.\n\r\nThank you Tabata, and thank you BC Staff. I'm forever grateful.\r\nUntil the next time we meet.\n"

            "content": "\n                Ever been, or at least heard of those fancy butler and maid caf\u00e9s? with the aristocrat ceiling decoration, full high quality skirting board of the era. Those caf\u00e9s are more appreciated for their atmosphere and special customer service which make you feel like a legitimate duke being served his afternoon cup of tea.\r\nBut, of course, everything can be parodied, or at least copied to an extent. With the rise of Anime, Otakus were flooding from nowhere replacing the stereotypical millennials demanding a freedom of speech for their fresh odd tastes, and so there was an explosion in the medium of Otaku caf\u00e9s where waitresses andwaiters (mostly waitresses for reasons) cosplay as a specific Anime character and server their customers on a more Anime-like way. That intro took long enough. \u201cBlend S\u201d is a wholesome slice of life light-hearted comedy show with 12 episodes that expands on this idea. But instead of experiencing the life-changing experience (according to Weaboos) that is being in on of those caf\u00e9s, and keep in mind, it's past 2010, so as most people enjoy looking at other people play games, you could possibly get an enjoyment out of seeing imaginary customers being served the traditional Anime way. Or maybe, you know, enough of imaginary things, and actually go outside and make some actual friends. If you'd rather not, then stick along the review.\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nSakuranomiya Maika, a high school student with charming black hear lacks confidence in her casual smile as referred by pretty much everyone to be vicious, and that of a sadist, having spent a long time looking for a part-time job but with no luck whatsoever to be accepted in one. One day while she's running to catch a job interview in time, she dumps into a foreigner from Italy, that's where she met her new job's manager, Dino. Well, lucky her, she gets recruited into an Otaku caf\u00e9 called \u201cStile\u201d where all the waitress are supposed to play a stereotypical treat from the wide weird world of Anime, and she just happens to put her sadist smile into work, and be the sadistic Anime character that disses and humiliates customers out of service, I know, I also have an exclamation point of view on these type of fetishes myself. The story plays out nice and at a considerable story progression that gives you something out of everything. Fanservice is, of course, present, but thank God they weren't suggestive with it, so rare and knows its time that it lets you beg if there was more. Along the way, the manager struggles to spend time with Maika who he develops a crush on, but thanks to their strong friendship bonds they make it out of every other bitter-sweet day of work.\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\r\nThis is one type of animation that I really enjoy. On wholesome and quite slice of life shows like this one, you don't really need the near perfect fluid animation to keep you focused as it lacks punch exchanges and epic bullet time stunts. All you will ever need is a clean, well maintained and consistent art style, and that's what Blend S delivers on. The color palette, for instance, is very vibrant and open, you see a variation of tints all at once, for each character theirs, no gloomy lighting or dark lazy colors, everything from the hair or the shiny eyes feels full of life, and compliments one's characteristics and treats. The alteration between the main art style and its respective minimalistic chibi version is only fermented by the smooth translations between serious and comedic conversations.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nIn general, the voice acting cast did a great job. So as lovely as the character designs are, they get cute feminine voices to add the topping on an already tasty looking cake (No sexual meaning after this). There were some near perfect English lines here and there that weren't worth the cringe shivers at all and were actually above average from what you'd expect from Japanese voice actors.\r\nThe opening and theme songs were just as good, speaking about the opening in more specification. After all, it's thanks to it we got the legendary \u201cBlend W\u201d parody that makes me shed tears every time I listen to it, if you still haven't seen it, then you're missing a lot, but just don't fall under the mistake of seeing it before you get familiar with the show's opening, that would sure give you some nasty nightmares.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nThis is, for me at least, a rare moment, to find a slice of life with no annoying characters is just glorious on its own. I enjoyed every single character and what it had to offer. With Stile being an Otaku like caf\u00e9, it presented a fitting roaster of employees, first you have the sadist Maika, and then the Tsundere Kaho, then enters the young sister Mafuyu (an actual adult in a loli body, so you're safe their boys), there is also the big sister figure Miu, and lately, the surprise character ;) (I know some people aren't going to like this one, at least I didn't), Hideri. And with that we conclude the female employees, leaving the manager Dino, and the chef Akizuki.\r\nWhat's great about these characters is everyone is unique, every character has at least two episodes centered on them, giving them the leading spotlight to express on themselves, leaving at least compatibility with a possible pair from the other side, which starts a cult of shipping very early on.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nSlice of life anime should all be enjoyed the same, that's a type of shows that isn't meant to hype you up or anything, but rather to enjoy while you're chilling after a hard day of work or school. The show addresses a lot of problems with its character, resulting in a variety of topics to discuss each episode, which doesn't render the events predictable and repetitive. I had my couple of laughs along the way, I shipped the two I wanted, and I wasn't disappointed in anything the show fails to deliver upon. Not what I would call a yearly-rewatch material, but it wouldn't hurt to see it with another friend.\n\r\n- Overall (7.3/10):\r\nYes, aside from the memes, which in this Anime's case are dead (sorry for that, but facts are facts), you should probably clear some time and give \u201cBlend S\u201d a try. It's not by any means some life-changing experience Anime that you must see, but it doesn't fall short from entertaining you, which is a rule of thumb of every show. And rest assured, the content is (considering there are few sexual sighting and references) semi-family friendly that you could recommend out loud without having fingers pointed at you.\n"

While they were moving in into a new town, Chihiro and her family decide to take a wrong turn out of curiosity, and that turn just happened to lead to the realm of spirits in which our story calls home.\r\nChihiro is exposed to a harsh reality she never knew, and her parents' freedom is at her mercy. As the time goes by, she makes friends and foes while trying to earn her quest for salvation.\r\nThat was all about the main focus of the plot, pretty basic and child-friendly. But under this thick skin of basic story lays layers of related highlights on all sorts of different relatable feelings we humans are cursed by, greed, jealousy, and bad intentions, as the protagonist forms new relationships, it becomes apparent which are the souls that are after fortune, and those of loyal love and kindness.\n\r\n- Art (10.0/10):\r\nAbsolutely stunning, I really hesitate most of the time on rating this part of the shows I get to review because of how much tricky it can be. Good animation doesn't resolve on high resolution, or high frames per seconds, even a still image can make a difference, and this is what Spirited Away does best. I've watched other Ghibli films which I still think are superior in terms of story and characters but talking about the art style and the animation, this blows away pretty much every single one of them. I still find it odd how can an animation from almost two decades ago be this good, I mean, really good, the painted backgrounds, and sharp edges on the fast-paced animations are just so satisfying to look at, I could get some high cinemagraphs on almost every frame I pause the video at. The 3D and anatomy proportions never feel unnatural and some of the scenes are just breathtaking that they end up distracting you from following the story at times, which is a good thing here, because it's used right, like when every field of flowers is on display, you can almost feel the wind blowing through your skin.\r\nAnother aspect of the animation was the bright use of alive colors, everything is colorful and attractive, the food, the clothes, skies, even mud feels nice to stare at. This is, by the very definition if great animation, a perfect work of art.\n\r\n- Sound (7.5/10):\r\nNot exactly the most memorable aspect of this movie, I don't think I even noticed there being any soundtracks playing mostly because I was so invested and paying full attention to what's going on the screen due to the gorgeous animation, for the most part, there were some really nostalgic Disney like sound effects kicking every now and then, and the voice acting was decent to kind of good on many occasions. Something about the protagonist just didn't catch the confusion of a 10 years old girl, some other voice acting moments felt also too forced and out of nature.\n\r\n- Character (7.2/10):\r\nDespite the very, very huge cast spanning this two hours long animation, none of them made me want more screen time of them, not that they were annoying or anything, in fact, I don't believe I got annoyed by anybody, and still, not a single one managed to have me on their side, I, of course, would still be rooting for the protagonist, but not care way too much in case something bad happened. Those all fall under the personalities and treats of the characters, another aspect concerning them, which I really am into is the character design, I have a mix between the classic Disney and anime treats, I like the way they depicted the old vicious lady and all other spirits.\r\nLastly, there was the character development, through the movie, Chihiro managed to fix her flaws, learned to stop being a brat that complains about everything, to a more mature and understanding behaving little girl.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\r\nThis was a decent experience, the movie managed to pick my interest on many occasions, but then getting uninterested minutes later, the pace was a bit too slow,  but the story progressed fine as I think, definitely the most family friendly Ghibli film I've seen so far, will I see it again, absolutely, next time with some friends.\n\r\n- Overall (8.0/10):\r\nSpirited Away is a wholesome experience suited for all people from toddlers to elders, it sets a nice tone for family and friendship and overcoming hardship, it isn't the highest grossing film in Japan for nothing, whether you have a taste in Ghibli films or not, heck even if you don't watch Anime movies at all, this could be your gateway through for all we know, fun watch for all, have fun.\n"

And with sometwists and with the help of Suzuha's far fetched imagination, they do make for amazing comedic opportunities that unfortunately are not well driven from there.\r\nThis OVA also gives us a snip of Mayuri that I personally never asked for, that is, erotic Mayuri, how could they taint such a pure soul?\r\nThe entire episode is one average wholesome and fun slice of life that only gives a nip of interesting twist at the end with Karagi and her disappearance.\n"

This special (although I'm not sure why isn't it considered a movie), serves as a prequel to the One Piece movie; Film: Gold, but surprisingly, it stands out as an independent contained story in itself, It got all of these adventure elements, very exciting and thrilling.\r\nWhat really shines in this special is that all the straw hats got to do what they are good at, everybody played a role in their adventure, and that's what made it really stand out amongother movies and specials, it really gives you the vibe of adventure and discovering exotic islands, the hunt for treasure is the strongest feel however.\n\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nThere was a legend about a rare metal called \u201cPure Gold\u201d, but a legend is no more when it's proven real, right? (Just like the lyrics on the first One Piece opening), along the way, the straw hats meet a mysterious girl that she has had lost trust in people, and somewhat lost and alone, but as she spends time with them, she learns from them how important it is to believe in your friends, and that it's easier and more fun to reach your goals with the help of your loved ones, there is a messed-up backstory of course, at the conclusion of the movie, you will notice some great opportunity to expand the One Piece lore and world building, and there are some really interesting clues about the history of the world as well.\n\r\n- Art (9/10):\r\nDifferently better than Toei's weekly animation, you would certainly wish One Piece was a release of the same quality, even if we had to sacrifice the weekly episodes for fully seasonal releases, the color palette used is a bit yellowish, more lively than it usually is, gives a warm tone of summer, and the animation is no fodder too, the movements feel very crisp and fluid, however, there were some unnecessary additions I noticed while watching, whenever there was a moment of Observation Haki usage, they seem to add an awkward red color to their eyes, probably to indicate that they are using Kenbonshoku? It really wasn't that necessary, but the pluses are extensively greater that the downvotes.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nYes, your typical One Piece soundtrack is strongly present, but there are indeed some additional tracks in the backgrounds, especially a very emotional lullaby, that's very heartwarming, yet with a noticeable sad tone to it, like that Naruto filler (Natsohuboshi why are you so red...), aside from the tracks, there was a slightly different use of sound effects, like punches and kicks impacts, I usually prefer the normal ones used in, the , as I found these ones very unfitting, where you can see Sanji hiting a target as hard as he can while the empact sound is a bit low and doesn't reflect the might of his kicks.\n\r\n- Characters (7/10):\r\nWell, even in immersive adventures, there can be some quite annoying characters involved, let's start with the girl called \u201cOlga\u201d, I personally didn't think someone can match up with the annoyance of Boruto's personality, but hey, not only does she share the same hair color, she could possibly be his soul mate, both brats are very noisy, and can make you really on their opposite side.\r\nAnother character would be the villain, as uninteresting as I found him, I couldn't even keep his name in my memory, he doesn't bring specifically anything new to the table, just the same ideals as your typical east-blue villains, very empty but barks the loudest.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10):\r\nYes, the special did leave me on my toes the whole time, mainly because of the sense of adventures, most of the times, the straw hats would be fighting one of the warlords, probably high ranking navy officers, or even some unknown name pirate crew, but this time around, there was a much brighter goal, it felt like a true adventure, totally what you would expect from aime like One Piece, the thrill and of discouvery is strongly present all the way, it was also amazing to see some familiar faces behid the scenes, and it even made watching the sequel movie Film: Gold more exciting.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI was very skeptical about whether to watch this special before diving into Film: Gold, but now that I've seen it, I would totally recommend it, and I certainly don't know what I was afraid of all this time from starting this.\n"

Or else I would have already called all of you gay for reading the review and call it a day, baby.\r\nSee above \ud83d\udc46? That's how easy it is to stray out of actually reviewing something and stalling for the extra paragraph to pad your already empty piece of uncohesive sentences that don't say anything despite taking up all of your screens. See? I've done it again, baby.\r\nWith a plot-free show much like the first season basically was (although it's debatable, but that's what the general public opinion is), Space Dandy isn't tied up to the traditional methods of sculpting up a proper storyline that holds itself against other broad titles, it speaks through the humor and irony of mocking up both real life and other high and mighty nouveau-rich names that try to scale up against the odds, it doesn't need a deep character behind it or even a super relatable one that makes all of the 14-year-olds go nuts memeing on social media and giving r/im14andthisisdeep something to feed upon. But season 2 embraced that change along with its loved and praised own made up way of developing a plot and throws you into a mix between both world's finest that you're left to appreciate the \u201cupgrade\u201d that you know a lot of people hate because change is something bad apparently. But this is how Space Dandy gives the middle finger to that, baby.\n\n\r\nStory (9.5/10):\r\nI can't say this for the majority of the first season, it was freaking amazing on its own way, but let's be honest, episodes that threw hints on what actually was going on were always there, and before you question in agony \u201cwait, this show has a plot?\u201d; yes it does, and always had since episode 1 season 1. Remember the two empires that were always warring? All fo those dimension-crossing jokes that get thrown around every single episode? All of those become relevant, so relevant in fact it makes Tube Simulator not relevant a single bit. And no, I don't want Pyramides (Only a 9-year-old would get the past references), baby.\r\nThere is a sense of immense satisfaction when finally when you've made it to the last episode and starting to link everything together, \u201choly shrimp, that makes a lot of sense\u201d is your catchphrase for the rest of the day after you finish watching the end-game. It's always been there, genuinely hidden it makes you chuckle all the time when you're on a re-watch. which you should totally do, baby.\n\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nTalk about astonishing and consistency as a duo that never fall short to keep up the same pace, there hasn't been a single episode that lacked the same quality content, visually speaking. Probably because of how varying it was. Remember how the previous season had all of those \u201cdifferent\u201d episodes that tackle different themes, arching from sad to goofy, yes takes it to a whole other level that it also packs up its own unique art style and animation, I could have sworn some of the episodes was so freaking visually wondering that I would mistake them for a world-class piece of painting, baby.\n\n\r\nSound (10/10):\r\nDisney, you should welcome a new competitor to your game, and yes, I'm talking about that legendary musical episode, how can an episode get even more divine each moment it continues until it gives you the south eargasm you've been leaning forward to but never expected to get in such a show? Leave it to Dandy I guess, baby.\r\nSo glad they kept the opening and ending sequences from the past season, and even introduced episode specials when they had to, and they were just as good (exclusive to the ending by the way), baby.\r\nI'm just going say, that, yeah, I'm making small paused, because, it's an important acknowledgment for me to make. Space Dandy has the best English dub I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. No, it's just, there is no contest, Space Cowboy held that title for so long it's time to let a new face sit on that thrown, baby.\n\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\r\nWho said a character had to have a complicated backstory to be up there with the big names? Just name it Dandy and there you go, you've just created an icon. But seriously, how can you hate on this refined legend?\r\nDandy, the man that needs no introduction, with as much dandiness a man could ever ask for is finally getting some booty, or should I say almost, either way, it's for you to interpret, finally given some closure on why it's only him, what makes him so special, and it seems with that many episodes around him, you kind of get why, but not really, turned out there was a deeper sense behind him all along. Let's just say, he's that thing you never want to mess with or you'll end up messing up the whole universe, baby.\r\nIt looked like QT and Meow got enough recognition from the first season as they had entire episodes centered around them, I wish there was more to uncover on them, but it was all dedicated for Dandy and his \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but you can always enjoy the goodness it gave us concerning Scarlet and Honey, even Dr. Gel had some great screening along with a specific character called Johhny who praise will require me to write a separate review on how cool a character he is, he didn't drop the line \u201chere comes Johnny\u201d for nothing, baby.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nIt takes a lot for me to let down from this perfect score, but considering the satisfaction, I got out of this show? If it can be converted to raw energy I'll be an oil mine to start world war 3, baby.\r\nI loved the gags, the fourth wall breaking jokes slammed the walls harder than ever, and the characters and theme discussed were some of my favorites, it has everything from death, love, relationships... baby.\r\nThis season had some of my all-time favorite episodes, along with the first season, of course, those were some of the most intense and genuin laughs I've ever got, baby.\r\nBut that's not all of it, it really walks you through a lot of different scenarios, it shows you the man Dandy really is, how much mystery he held inside of him all along, it's so was beautiful it can inspire you to do things, baby.\n\n\r\nOverall (9.6/10):\r\nHonestly, even if I was trying not to recommend this series, this season, in particular, makes it a confirmed yes from me, I would probably go rewatch the first season just so I can rewatch this one alone, and when they say they don't come up with shows like these lately, they are not joking at the very least. But each one has their cup of tea I guess, I still get that people don't actually like this series at all for how blunt and goofy it is, but it's the premise all along, it's about the comedy primarily, and the hidden depth secondarily. and I learned that slowly as I've always wondered why was this season way more praised than the first one even those the latter was beautiful, but I guess it's up for the mood too to decide. At least for now, all I can see is, see you Space Dandy...\n"

Very generic, almost feel like a placeholder to some other more realized characters, not only the roles they played but even the visual design they inherit. The animation did not help either. Think of the most barebone not exciting art style, it's like a bootleg imitation of KyoAni.\n\r\nI would say that the first arc was very solid and a great start to the series, but in contrast, it set up too high of a ceiling for the rest of the series to keep up with.

            "content": "\n                Disclaimer: minor movie spoilers; major Hunter x Hunter spoilers for the Chimera Ant arc.\n\r\nAfter the mild let down that was the first movie; a let down in a sense of expecting way too much after experiencing the marvelous Anime series, tackling the second movie was approached with a careful gaze, no expectations built up for this one, a harsh lesson I learned in after watching the previous movie indeed.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nLet me start by stating the turn-off. For the better or the worst. I'm a very picky individual when it comes to judging a story. And I try doing that as much as I can, sometimeseven after several rewatches to try to grasp the topics discussed better in order to formulate a conclusive, open-minded idea on it. This movie straight up said no to that, I don't deserve it, carry on with your review-disguised rant.\r\nGoing into side stories for a bigger series you're following always calls for their canon relevance, the exact timeline in the story and the bordering events that make sense of telling the story in the first place. I had no words for this one, completely a random shameless way to milk bloody fan money. And please, don't take me for the aggressive bigot that this vocabulary advocate, but rather, open u to what I'm saying.\r\n\u201cWHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHIMERA ANT ARC?\u201c I can't stress this one enough, about to start pulling off my hair while typing this, for a big of a plot changer that arc was, it was the big wall from letting whatever this attempt was into relating properly to the TV show. And I'm not even mad at it for it for the reasons you might think I am.\n\r\nAccording to what THE MOVIE suggests, it takes place after the Chimera Ant arc, in a weird timeline where the Chimera Ant outbreak never happened. Kite never died and Gon never went through his infamous breakdown. And of course, Netero lived to fight a movie villain instead.\r\nBatting an eye for the weak approach of properly lining up with the canon story, it lives on top of an interesting tale of revenge between Netero and an old rival, Jed, while also being a call back for the Heaven's Arena days where the events of the movie take place at.\n\r\nArt (8.4/10):\r\nI would say this movie featured some of the best Sakuga in Hunter x Hunter. Definitely levels above that of the first movie, up there with the best choreographically intense eye candy from the TV series.\r\nThe animation is superfluid when its called for. The use of bland colors helped preserve the signature Hunter x Hunter feel on the visual level, and the character design for the movie-original cast was a critical hit on the nail. Borderland style.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend it was just another day in Lazytown, but if your ear could speak, it would want to honor the voice actors. The main cast has and is always performing amazingly. What hit defiantly was the OST's, again, with the popular songs from the TV series, remixed into piano abstracts that filled the backgrounds helped greatly to sell the desperate presentation of Jed and his underlings as villains to the main characters, but heroes to their cause.\n\r\nCharacters (7.6/10):\r\nI mean, going by the same rule as the first movie's review. Talking about the key characters, that's a guaranteed 10/10 if not more, however, for the sake of focusing on the movie specifically, let's shed some light on the movie's original characters, whom are represented by the cast of villains.\r\nJet, the main head to take down was not that much for an eye-catcher for me personally, felt like a shallow character, created to simply act his role and carry on the revenge plot, however, his trio underlings whom the names of I can't remember had more personality than Jed's entire screen time, which is still minimal. I'd hate to go on the tangent I said I won't, but come on, seeing characters like Biscuit, Hisoka, and Zushi is always welcomed.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nAside from the weird timeline which I don't know why I can't drop that already; seeing the loveable familiar faces lightened up the heart quite a bit. Despite not conveying what Hunter  Hunter really is about, the movie doesn't fall short of implementing some of Hunter x Hunter's best properties like the character interactions and wholesome yet life-challenging rivalry between your well-known characters, and of course, the weird Nen trickery that introduced the concept of On.\n\r\nOverall (7.9/10):\r\nThe movie was definitely a step in the right decision. Although still not emitting enough Hunter x Hunter vibes, it covers an interesting original self-contained story, one that is better off recited as a one-shot, rather than trying to make sense of in the canon timeline of the story, because it went completely the other way around\n"

It's really satisfying how they dug up their past, only to make them seem connected somehow.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nI haven't noticed any differences between this animation, and that of the first season, both are great and colorful, very lively and wholesome, ever wondered how could a drawing be wholesome? Here it is, how the characters are drawn, how the backgrounds blend so well with the atmosphere and everything, something that this anime does so well, is the representation of food, yes you heard me right, food looks so much more appealing in anime and manga, but in this particular show, it's done so well that it makes you believe it was done by purpose, and that's just one example.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI can't think of a better fitting score for this, just like the first season, the same wholesome tracks play all the time, nothing new, or at least that's what I think, I really like the opening, it was one of those openings that are really odd and unlikable at the beginning,but I really grew to love it, and the same can be said about the ending song.\n\r\n- Character (7.8/10):\r\nYour same old characters, but less annoying (yes, looking at you Sylphinford freaking Tachibana), and more likable, like Kirie-chan, what really helped raise the quality of the characters is the way they developed into the best, Bomber and Alex got some more screentime, and so did Kanau, I thought that was great, there were few other characters introduced, like family members, some of them were really interesting, but some of them were just not welcomed, of at least that's how I felt when I first saw Hikari.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nOne might argue that this anime is just a waste of your precious time, a waste of resources and energy, it has no story for it, nothing at all, BUT, this second season, looked much more dynamic, it felt like the studio learned from their mistakes, and improved upon them, I really enjoyed every bit of this anime.\n\r\n- Overall (8.02/10):\r\nYes, the decimal precision matters in the score.\r\nWould I recommend this anime? It certainly is not for everyone, most the people who watched enough anime, read enough manga would grasp those little hints and references about other works, it true comedy in the show for me, lays there.\n"

Your inner self.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI, for the most part, enjoy stories that have hidden meanings, stories that have under the blanket more than a typical user can get a grasp on, it's not for everyone, but if you do have the intellectual capacity to understand it, that is a great boost of ego on itself.\n\r\n- Overall (8.3/10):\r\nThis 5 min of animation would get an 8 from me, I totally didn't waste my time watching it, or did I?\r\nno really, I liked it for the masterpiece it is,\r\nWait? what am I doing with my life? oh, an even better question, why are you reading this review? long story, short, I would recommend this to the more mature type of watcher, one that isn't just about the action, fan service, or animation, but one who wants something deep and exciting.\r\nhave we stuck in an infinite loop ourselves? you never know, ....... or do you?!\n"

The fandom always seemed to me like a cultish and uncharted sea that your grandmother would persist you ignore, but hey, let me voice what I think about theAnime itself and not the fandom.\n\r\nI'm a big Attack on Titan fan, I still remember back in the day, when the first season was still the talk of the town, I would speculate, chart, and debate myself even about future outcomes of the story, way back when it was still posing as an edgy Shounen bait, back when t was still compared to Naruto and Tokyo Ghoul, weird times, I know, but what we have today is the amalgamation of converging paths of decisions and detours that one would never have predicted. I'm been missing out on the \u201chype\u201d behind many of the big moments of the show, merely for the simple fact that I was watching with a group of friends that would gasp and scream at every line of dialog, completely ruining it for me, and thus moments like \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d and the entire \u201cgood\u201d part of season 3 part 2 feel like average midpoints in the series, I never look fondly back on them, they don't stand out in my memory at all, and what a shame it is, but this season, I took the initiative to watch the show on my own, at my own pace and alone, and what an ice breaker it was. It was like looking at the show from a different window.\n\r\nThis season houses some of the most balsy and risky storytelling decisions of any show, completely flipping the script on its head and then foot by the end of every episode. It left me questioning everything about every character, it changed my views of some characters I had given up trying to justify or understand, it redeemed a lot and resolved many knots that were boggling my mind to this day, especially a specific couple of episodes where everything's been laid down and for other first time, and the end was visible from where we are.\n\r\nI think this season ended the debate of \u201cwhich studio did it best\u201d, after all, the direction especially on certain episodes was all the fuss and for good reasons, it really shows how a good adaptation can brining out the shine more than you can anticipate from an already great story\n\r\nThis season was the breaking point between sanity and madness, it was the strip between law and chaos, it was definitely the season of confusion, all knots are tangled, all axis flipped the other way around and everything became so unpredictable, it reflects well on how high the stakes are, there is so much at hand than the big and complex conflicts that drove the series for 4 seasons is but a simple insignificant problems against a much bigger and tangled debacle.\n\r\nAttack on Titan really continues to rule its territory, there is nothing to be afraid of besides a good, satisfying ending, but that we won't know for a while, as said till now, it is definitely a pioneer in the field, an untouched king and a critic in and of itself.\n"

It steers the current on the fandom ships quite hard, leaving none disappointed.\n\r\nIt is the type of OVA that leaves you wanting though.

The song itself is a soulful, melodic track with a catchy hook and a driving beat that keeps the listener engaged from start to finish.\n\r\nOne of the standout features of the music video is the way it uses an innocent, whimsical art style to contrast with the often dark and complex themes of the anime. The video follows a group of characters as they navigate a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world filled with demonic creatures and supernatural powers, with thevisuals featuring bright, colorful characters and backgrounds that look like they were plucked straight out of a children's storybook.\n\r\nThis contrast between the innocent, whimsical art style and the dark, complex themes of the anime creates a sense of tension and intrigue that keeps the viewer engaged. The characters' struggles to survive in this dangerous world are juxtaposed with their cute, cartoonish appearances, adding an extra layer of depth and emotion to the story.\n\r\nThe use of this art style also serves to highlight the themes of hope and perseverance that run throughout the Chainsaw Man anime. Despite the characters' struggles and the dangers they face, they remain optimistic and determined to overcome their challenges, and this is reflected in the bright, cheerful visuals of the music video.\n\r\nAdditionally, the music video also contains hints of sexual content, with the characters depicted in provocative poses and engaging in suggestive activities. This contrast between the cute, cartoonish art style and the more explicit themes of the song adds an extra layer of discomfort and unease to the viewing experience.\n"

            "content": "\n                \u201cViolet Evergarden: Kitto \"Koi\" wo Shiru Hi ga Kuru no Darou\u201d is an OVA that doesn't differ from the traditional content the normal episodes of the parent series deliver, it makes it pretty odd to see it released as a standalone piece of animation.\n\r\nFor people wondering about the watch order of this, like myself, most people would decide to watch it after they have finished the parent series, which is fine, however, the most appropriate time to watch this is after the fourth episode and before the fifth episode as it kind of makes sense looking at the dialogue they speak during the OVA.\n\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nMuchlike the traditional way the parent series was directed, this is one of those other self-contained stories that have Violet attend some challenging ghostwriting jobs where she manages to help up an individual put together a piece of literature while she herself is gaining life experience and leveling up her emotional capacities as she always ends up relating to the client one way or another. You can say it's pretty repetitive looking at how the whole story is directed, but you can't blame anybody for this as it only serves the plot progression the way it was set up to be.\n\r\nThe pacing was very good, better than most of the episode from the parent series, but again, the backstory was all the same. One woman lost a loved one and wants to express her feelings on a paper, witch on the greater picture, it works as a really well-written mini-arc, but something \u201cnew\u201d would have been appreciated.\n\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nWe can clearly see they kept up the same consistency when it came to the visual side of the final product. I gave the parent series a solid 10/10 considering the visuals, but this one doesn't really apt to the same level, mainly due to the lack for beautiful still shots of those sunset backgrounds that we've come to love about the original, and not to say that there were none, but you'd figure that they would at least give us an overdose of that imagery.\n\r\nThe OVA is still clearer than most other OVAs where they tend to lower down the production value, and that's definitely a plus.\n\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nI guess that the same thing can be said about the vocals, opening and ending theme songs, soundtracks, voice acting, you name it, anything that's hear-able doesn't leave any excuses for any complaint.\r\nMore than anything, there was an opera audition at the end, where they really went with full force on our fragile ears, the song was really good, the lyrics were solid and the attached emotions only made it stronger.\n\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\r\nSo sad to be let down on this one. The episode mainly focuses on this suffering famous performer that again, falls under the same repetitive platera of having lost her boyfriend to war, as we were supposed to connect with her, it felt like she never felt approachable in any way, I know I didn't relate and thus I feel as though she fell short on delivering the same development as the characters of the parent series, although, those as well have had some pretty underdevelopment in their respective contexts. It was those little things, like seeing Erica blush while staring at Benedict, man it was a shame we never got more of that.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nNot what I'd call a re-watch material, but I could probably get some people into Violet Evergardenby simply recommending this standalone OVA. It doesn't spoil much and it serves as a pretty decent preview on what the series is about. I really like the song at the end of the OVA more than anything else in this mini-story, I like the main characters interactions, it seems what the parent series lacked the most concerning them was present here.\n\n\r\nOverall (7.7/10):\r\nYou could definitely skip this without sacrificing anything that can affect your \u201cexperience\u201d with the parent series, it was good on the greater picture unless you start nitpicking every single slip up there is.\n"

            "content": "\n                The surprisingly highly regarded guilty pleasure show, (the fans can confirm) makes another return after a long time break, this time with a new studio.\r\nThe past seasons were mostly fine with the second season being of great status, this season had a huge potential from what we've seen from the clatter of events in the third season, but hey, if this sounds familiar, think about what season three was to season two. It didn't greatly deliver on its predecessor's promises but it was okay. And then comes High School DxD Hero promising with something even greater than the last one, will it deliver? I questionmyself at the beginning, I knew I had to watch it sooner or later, but the pay off was as oblivious as one's vision on a moonless night.\n\r\n- Story (7.2/10):\r\nMuch like the other seasons, fanservice is a massive chunk of nonsense, pills amoung pills stacking up on top of each other, but on some rare occasions, a faint aroma of a spicy plot can be felt.\r\nUnlike the other seasons, High School DxD New was a magnificent one story wise that set up a pretty high standards for its successors to surpass, but that has got to yet happen, but with the work of the miracle worker, the Boob Dragon (I know it's weird for newcomers), anything is possible, they just don't have to underestimate what good character development can produce.\r\nFollowing the events shortly after the previous season, but unfortunately not covering a really good arc that has appeared on the source material, a rating game between the Gremory and Stiri households, there we get to see Saji going all out revealing on his new abilities, and oh boy those were some exciting ones. That aside, they really should have included it on this season, but all we got were some references that left most of the anime-only-fans confused.\r\nThis season consists of two main story arcs, the first half of the season covers the main cast (mostly, excluding a few) going to a trip to Kyoto where they get involved in some crazy mess that has them fight against a monstrous organization that claims to have enough power to destroy the gods. They have to rescue a kidnapped fox with nine tails (sounds familiar enough? trust me, there is more of this). It wasn't really all that exciting, but we get to at least see Issei figuring out how his powers work, and improving on them.\r\nFor me at least, it all was around the second half of the shown. that was the closest it can get to reach the second season's hype for it was probably the most entertaining rating game on display. Where the Gremory team gets to fight one of the Bael family, Sairaorg, a yet interesting character with a lot to him than we thought at first. I can at least say that this season had a storytelling compared to that of the third season, which I think was good.\n\r\n- Art (7.8/10):\r\nAs I've mentioned before, a new studio is handling High School DxD for now, that's Passione if you're interested. And with new teams and workflow comes new animation techniques and quality.\r\nFor me, I was so used to the old studio's way of doing thing that I genuinely had trouble recognizing some of the characters, most of them look a lot different, be it the color contrasts change or generally the design, but it's not something that concerning, a couple of episodes should be enough to get you used to it. Aside from the art style being like a damn stranger, the animation was a huge step up. It works very well with the new art style, everything looks more fluid and impactful.\r\nSomething I really disliked here was that apparently, every single girl in the cast had an increase in her cup size, and it was disturbing, I wasn't prepared for a busty Asia. Somethings just have to stay the way they are.\r\nBody proportions aside, some faces really looked very unnatural and unattractive, like my dude, Kiba, like, where did it go wrong fam? he was a freaking handsome pill of paths and now he can barely hold a natural facial expression.\n\r\n- Sound (7.8/10):\r\nFor the most part, both the opening and the end theme songs are likable, even from the first exposure. Differently better than the second season's second opening, that shit can never be recovered.\r\nThe voice acting is just at its best, I can't imagine what process they go through to have Issei say some ridiculous stuff while maintaining a serious tone of voice. the shouting and everything was epic and emotional, I'm just glad they didn't have a different team do the voice acting, that would have been a demonic disaster.\r\nSomething that really puts me in the most for some Juggly effects are the excellent soundtracks, no matter what you change, please don't replace those. They have stuck in with the show from the beginning till this late on, they even left a landmark on my memory, the show wouldn't be the same without them.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nFinally, some actually good characters to look at too. Along with some other characters that we previewed in the last season, Sairaorg proved to have a lot of depth to him, his motive and backstories, everything makes you root for the guy. And for you Rock Lee lovers, this is a character that you will treasure.\r\nFor once, Issei and Rias had some focus on their relationship and treats. Seriously, Issei is completely a different person, one that can control his emotions and realize his mistakes very quickly. And Rias isn't just another character that's just there for either comic relief, of extreme fanservice. She even managed to be the necessary switch for Issei's power at this point. and the two finally made up a solid relationship by the end of the show. Issei and some others have never been so close to being high ranking devils, it's all for the fifth season to answer.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.3/10):\r\nWe all know what sort of guilty pleasure enjoyment we get from this. And as a Sage once said, \u201cthere are two kinds of actions in this show\u201d, if you don't get what that quote says, then you're only inches from going to heaven.\r\nI love fanservice as much as the next guy, but it can get annoying, out of place, and just look bad and cringy. And there is a lot of cringy in this season, some might say, it's the first time High School DxD has been this cringy. But that doesn't obscure the good parts.\r\nStorywise, the hype was real, especially on the second half, you could barely contain yourself from watching those oddly satisfying punches and finishers.\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\r\nAgain, if you already caught up with the first three seasons, don't pass on this one. You might not like the new animation, but the story and fanservice are at least still true to itself. And seriously, if you don't care enough about the characters, there are new ones that are just as good if not better. But if you're just fed up with the franchise, I trust that the trilogy can hold up as a great guilty pleasure show on its own.\n"

It would be a lie to disregard that, but not entirely. This show has a way with the audience, and that's saying it lightly.\n\r\nWhat's a better start than the man himself, Onizuka,a man larger than life, and manlier than grunts, it may have been weird to watch the main character younger in age than me for instance, but that is easily overshadowed by how dramatic and impactful his character is to everything else in the show. He is a character that makes it hard to let go when it's time to move on, \u201cbut you can always rewatch\u201d one might say, true, but the experience of getting to know this man from ground zero is something of a privilege and prestige, it's like being a phantom member of the main classroom and getting to warm up to this delinquent of a loser with time, and what a time it was.\n\r\nSpeaking about the class, it's easily one of the best large gatherings of characters in Anime, everyone has time to shine, they have involvement with progressing their arcs rather than just standing there and delivering baseless lines of dialogue. And the setting to has a big charm on everything else, I don't know about you, but late 90s Japan is just a whole vibe.\n\r\nThe overarching plot feels like a hybrid of an American sitcom and a pre-outlined story yet it flows very transparently and with no hagglings.\r\nLet's not forget how magical and nostalgic the soundtrack is, it almost creeps in when you least expect it and completely transforms the mood of the episodes, from a comedy set up to a whole sobbing section with relatable backstories that are closer to real-world problems than anything else.\n\r\nMy only grip if I had any would have been the quality of the animation, it is without a doubt dated, but by no metric bad, just a bit noisy and fogged.\r\nOnizuka sensei might have been an over-the-top character, but he sure left a mark, and so did this show, it was rightfully named. Great Teacher Onizuka.\n\r\nOverall: 8.8/10\n"

However, ever since summer 2018, a certain show has managed to stay relevant throughout the couple of years that have passed, havingpeople still admire what it brought, and nag what it didn't properly hit all the while I was trying to avoid the heated debates and laying to my self that I will never have to watch it anyways, that is until I randomly wanted to see some Mecha action, enter, Darling in the franXX. \n\r\n- Story (7.5/10):\r\nUnder the cover, the plot is just the common barebone kids piloting mechs to save the world, sucking on its sex references that drive 90% of the episodes, making you question the horny 13 years old who put together this mess of whining clueless tweens, however, the show slowly, but surely pushed me off my high horse and showed a massive potential for how great it can be, the world started to feel much more massive, with lore and history to it, making you ask questions and think about all sorts of things that might happen to the characters in the future and what predated them, until it decided to ignore all it built up and end off on the most anti-climactic resolution that left me and the majority of the audience facepalming. And for a story that might have mattered more, it hurts the overall perspective of the narrative. For the first 20 episodes, this show would have been no less than a solid 8, but the ending makes most of the show and it's what sticks out the most, it's unfortunate to see potential crumble just when you are starting to stan it.\n\r\nThe show follows a steady pace that varies from an incredibly fast-paced action frame to a slow and nourished info-dump with glimpses of episodic episodes that build up on top of each other. I appreciated how even the most irrelevant episode dropped hints and clues on what was going on the background all along, the show might have distracted us with a coming of age drama between immature tweens, but it was building up for a reveal that did not live up to the hype, unfortunately, but it doesn't hurt the attempt though, in fact, you could emit the last 4 or 5 episodes and still end up with a fun, good experience.\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, the story follows this group of kids, trained from as long as they can remember to fight against these destruction abominations called Klaxosaur in a battle to dominate the earth, or what's left of it, humans are driven to the edge of extinction, only managing to survive inside mobile fortresses, referred to as \u201cPlantations\u201d that each has an assigned force of \u201cParasytes\u201d that compose of a group of tweens/teens to protect it.\n\r\nI have to give credits though, I liked how the show goes a mile and justifies why the faith of humanity lies on Kids. It's definitely a common trope where your 15 years old character is tasked with saving the world or whatever where mighty military forces would fail, but in the perspective of the narrative and what we find later, it really makes sense to have none other than these kids do the job.\n\r\n- Art (8/10):\r\nThe easiest I can put it into words, everything looks like soaked cany. The first thing that comes to mind is Zombieland Saga. The art style definitely strikes as a cute wholesome middle school slice of life, surprising you with how fluid and kind of sharp it changes when the call of battle is upon the characters. The character design was as generic as it can get, even for the protagonist, however, I would say, Zero Two and a certain character that appears later outclass everyone else in the show, at least, visually speaking.\n\r\n- Sound (8/10):\r\nI did not notice anything to pick on, vocally-wise, the voice acting lived up to the moments, the OSTs matched the action and the opening theme song was a party banger, it doesn't note please the ear on the first hear (at least for me), but it's definitely a grower.\r\nThe show also featured several ending theme songs they were brief and changed very fast, but there were at least a couple that really rolled the vibes.\n\r\n- Character (8/10):\r\nWhen I first started watching, and after being introduced to the main cast, I would say nobody caught my eyes or struck me as much as Zero Two did, the sight of her was enough to give extra attention every time she was on screen, and I would mainly blame that on character design, I swear Hiro, the protagonist even did not appear any different from a generic background crow character, especially when he stands besides lesser characters. His buddies were much more of a looker to the eyes, they had weight, their presence could be felt, unlike Hiro's cold and gloomy presence. In fact, while you would see in other shows how the surroundings change and sculpt the main character, it was totally the inverse here, Hiro changes everyone around him, but fails to do the same for himself, or at least, to a comparable degree. First-episode Hiro is not that much different of a person from episode-24 Hiro, but everyone else are \u201cwho are these new people\u201d. Heck, I would start hating or disliking a certain character, two episodes later after they get a min-redemption arc, they are already at the top of my favorites.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9/10)\r\nI honestly dived in just for the sake of moving this across to my \u201cwatched\u201d list and relate to the memes, I expected a generic watch though that I would have to force myself to finish in the next 3 months, I ended up binging it for under 6 days, and that's seeing a lot looking at my busy schedule. I laughed, I tore, I cheered, I speculated, this show kept me on the edge of my seat. My only dissatisfaction came from the resolution of the whole thing, however, I can't deny how well the suspense played through the whole run.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI do not consider myself big on Mecha, in fact, the only Mecha shows I've seen are this one and Code Geass, and both of theme I enjoyed for completely Mecha-unrelated things. I would really recommend watching this, granted, do not step in with huge expectations, do not expect a groundbreaking revelation or anything of that sort. Let the show lead you, and not the other way around. Maybe you will be one of the people that really stan with everything the show did, but even if you disliked the ending, everything that precedes it is still there.\n"

Asta and Yuno, two orphan childhood friends make their way to the event, while Yuno gets his legendary Grimoire that resembles the first emperor's, Asta was let down and never got his own Grimoire, making him ridiculed in front of everybody, but not until he accidentally somehow awaken his true powers, and gets an even more high-class legendary Grimoire of his own in the most clich\u00e9 way possible. I bet you've got to at least have heard of a similar synopsis. A lot of people accuse the writer to have plagiarised the Naruto and Fairy Tail, but it is faintly noticed that it tries to remain as original as it can. The humor wasn't the best aside from some unexpected weird expressions. The pacing was good at most, showing you a glimpse of different things, and the backstory was simple and harmless at work.\n\r\n- Art (7.8/10):\r\nNot what I'd call a superb one. The CGI parts were just horrible, and the art style was being conflicted sometimes like a hybrid of many other art styles. The character's eyes looked uneven and weird, especially Asta's, and generic background crown couldn't look more generic. The color palette reminds me a little bit of Skyrim for how gloomy and medieval it sounds, it makes perfect for the probable era the setting is set up at.\n\r\n- Sound (5/10):\r\nI had a light headache before watching this one, and Asta's voice only made it worse. The guy doesn't know how to catch a break. Some other voice actors sound very forced, boring or over-dramatic. The soundtracks weren't as noticeable or anything, I just can't think of something good to praise here.\n\r\n- Character (6.5/10):\r\nI was eager to reach this stage, Asta, how do I put it. The emperor of magic? more like the emperor of quibbling, constant screaming and nagging, dude, take it easy. And then there is Yuno, the classic hot, claim semi-emo boy that give you the expectations of him turning a villain at some point. I couldn't give more attention to other characters are the special went deep with the relationship of Yuno and Asta backing their feelings up.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.0/10):\r\nAs much flaws as it had, it really picked interest for me to check out the main series, it's been a long time since I last saw Naruto, so even if it was a straight up copy-pasta I would still like to keep up with this longer and see where it's headed. I like the lore that can be milked from mage stories, and the medieval setting overall just feels nice to see other than the Isekai stuff.\n\r\n- Overall (6.8/10):\r\nI believe that for newcomers that are interested in watching Black Clover, this can serve as a better replacement for the 3 episodes rule most of the people tend to rely on in determining whether to finish a show or not. It introduces a lot of aspects of the series very briefly and effectively and was overall a mediocre sneak peak on the world of Black Clover.\n"

With each season, it gets harder and harder to classify under a specific genre. Shounen? Drama? Slice of Life? Why not all?\n\r\nThis show has been an entertainment monster for the years it spanned, and to no one's surprise, season 2 was a peak in the medium, and season 3 surely followed. Although not as consistent, still in the limbo verse between seasons 1 and 2. To say the least, it was a phenomenal trip all the way through the end.\n\r\nIf you read my previous seasons' reviewsyou'd see me often boast about the character development rights this series tackles, but this season was even more of a step up in that regard, all in all, everyone, and Mob especially went through huge changes and beat a lot of challenges and surpassed themselves in unexpected ways. It truly is an example other shows need to take in that regard.\n\r\nThis show is more than a seasonal fade-out, it's an era marked by One sensei who struck the world with his One Punch Man works, but evolved it to completion in perfect amends with Mob Psycho 100.\n\r\nMob will be more than missed. But he will always be there whenever I want a nostalgic rewatch. Don't miss out on this one.\n\r\nOverall: 9.44/10.\n"

Such lofty claims and heightened expectations could often lead to disappointment, but the curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to dive into thisphenomenon.\n\r\nWith trepidation and a touch of skepticism, I embarked on my Oshi no Ko journey, fully aware of the potential dangers of falling victim to overhype. I braced myself for the possibility of being let down, as previous instances of hype often resulted in shattered expectations. However, much to my surprise and delight, Oshi no Ko turned out to be a one-in-a-billion exception.\n\r\nFrom the very first episode, it became evident that this anime was something special. It possessed a unique and captivating charm that immediately drew me in. The intricate storytelling, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes were masterfully woven together, creating a narrative tapestry that held me spellbound. Oshi no Ko effortlessly managed to exceed the colossal expectations placed upon it, surpassing the hype and delivering an experience that far surpassed anything I could have imagined.\n\r\nThe series had an uncanny ability to immerse the viewer in its world, evoking a wide range of emotions with each passing episode. The intense emotional rollercoaster ride left me breathless, as I became deeply invested in the characters' struggles, triumphs, and heartbreaks. The writing was impeccable, presenting a thought-provoking exploration of fandom culture, obsession, and the blurred boundaries between reality and fiction. It deftly tackled complex themes while still maintaining an entertaining and engaging storyline.\n\r\nFurthermore, the animation and artistry of Oshi no Ko were nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame was a visual feast for the eyes, with meticulous attention to detail and stunning visual aesthetics. The character designs were unique and memorable, adding depth and authenticity to the story. The soundtrack further enhanced the viewing experience, perfectly complementing the emotional beats and adding an extra layer of depth to the storytelling.\n\r\nIn the end, Oshi no Ko lived up to the monumental hype surrounding it, proving to be a standout series that not only met but surpassed the expectations placed upon it.

This exceptional series broke the mold, exceeded all expectations, and left an indelible mark on both the anime fandom and the industry as a whole. Oshi no Ko stands as a testament to the power of storytelling and serves as a reminder that amidst the hype and anticipation, there can still be genuine and exceptional creations that defy expectations and leave an enduring impact.\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10.\n"

These episodes endeavor to stitch together untold stories from the manga, aiming to enrich the tapestry of this beloved series. Yet, despite its noble intentions, it treads a path that feels more like a meandering stroll than a triumphant march.\n\r\nAt the heart of \"Horimiya: Piece\" is a retrospective journey, a bittersweet saunter down memory lane. The narrative weaves through the moments of joy, laughter, and tender awkwardness that define the high school experiences of Hori, Miyamura,and their friends. However, this narrative patchwork, though sprinkled with heartfelt moments, struggles to capture the magic that made the main series so engaging. The stories, while endearing, seem to lack the depth and emotional resonance that might have elevated this epilogue. It's akin to flipping through a photo album, where the pictures are charming but the stories behind them are told in hushed tones.\n\r\nWhere \"Horimiya: Piece\" shines, however, is in its production quality. The animation is a visual treat, maintaining the high standard set by the series. Every frame is crafted with care, ensuring the characters and their world are as vibrant and detailed as ever. This visual finesse extends to the sound design, which complements the animation beautifully, enveloping the viewer in the familiar, comforting ambiance of Horimiya's world.\n\r\nThe portrayal of characters in this special is a mixed bag. While it is always a pleasure to revisit these familiar faces, their development feels somewhat static. The charm and quirks that made them endearing are present, but there's a sense of them merely going through the motions, lacking the growth or introspective depth that a graduation setting might have offered. It's like meeting old friends only to find that the conversation doesn't quite flow as it once did.\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, \"Horimiya: Piece\" might not hit the high notes expected by fans of the original series. For some, it may come off as an underwhelming excursion, lacking the compelling narrative drive of its predecessor. It feels like a love letter to the fans, yet one that doesn't quite capture the essence of the first love that drew them in.\n\r\n\"Horimiya: Piece\" is a gentle echo of a series that resonated with many. It\u2019s a reminder of the fleeting nature of high school days, of friendships and romances that burn bright and then fade. For those deeply invested in the world of Horimiya, this special offers a chance to bid a final farewell. But for others, it might serve as a reminder that sometimes, memories are best left as they are \u2013 imperfect, yet cherished.\n\r\nOverall: 6.32/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                One Piece: Episode of East Blue - Luffy to 4-nin no Nakama no Daibouken is yet another One Piece title, and honestly, as big a fan of One Piece I am, I absolutely can't get enough of it, I watched the series twice including all of the fillers, all of the movies, OVAs, and I finally had time the time to see these highly praised specials, I know how intense and epic One Piece can get, so I obviously got in with high expectations, but, did it deliver?\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nThis special was mainly focused on telling the five original Strawhat's backstories, how they met, andwhat they dream of. It was definitely without a doubt a solid refresher, but it always was extremely short and scattered all over the place, you can't possibly fit all Luffy, Sanji, Nami, Zoro, and Usopp's stories in an hour and a half long animation.\r\nStill, as good a reminder of early events it was, I wouldn't recommend it for people who want to start their One Piece experience over watching the original East Blue Saga, while the original telling of the story has its own downfalls, it still holds up better than this special.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nIf only the weekly production looked this good, I mean, everything, from the facial expression and character anatomy from up close, to the extreme details in the backgrounds, probably the best aspect of the special that's better than the original, considering the budget that went into this, I just loved seeing some crispy updated animation to the Zoro and Mihawk fight, and the Sanji and Ghin fight too, it really adds to the rather jiggly original animation that we have in the anime.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nFor the most part, the voice acting was as good as the parent series, the soundtracks still rocking, the sound effects don't feel dizzy and rushed, more is there to praise than to rant over.\n\r\n- Character (9.5/10):\r\nI mean, why would I get any less than a perfect score? the crew still feels like the OG crew, Arlong is just as mean and so are Kuro and Krieg, you get to hate the characters you're supposed to, and like the ones the writer wants you to, but still, the animation is not any soft on the fanservice part, and don't get me wrong on this part, I really enjoyed not having any extreme fanservice scenes, it all felt normal, but still, Nami and Nojiko, heck all of the females are armed with just as big of a pair of melons as the post time-skip chaos. But I guess, it wouldn't sell as much without that.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nThis was a really enjoyable watch, currently, as the Manga is really kicking off the hype of the Reverie arc, it really is good to go back and see how things were before, much quieter, and no big deals lurking around the Strawhats, how it all began, and the feel of those initiative villains that always downgraded Luffy as a no-name pirate, who barks with more than he can handle.\n\r\n- Overall (8.6/10):\r\nHaving not seeing any of the One Piece special, this one is sort of encouraging to see the others too, One Piece: Episode of East Blue - Luffy to 4-nin no Nakama no Daibouken was a great experience, It really filled my nostalgia tank for the week on one sit, whereas it would take several binge watching for old One Piece episodes clip, now, I would highly recommend this for the One P\u00efece fans that made it past the time skip and wanted to get a refresher to how it all started.\n"

Such a huge plot device will surely connect to a tangled web of deep and touching backstories that explain it all, and that's what this movie was about.\n\r\nThe movie is a direct prequel to the show, long before Subaru arrive in this world, long before Emilia settled in with Roswald and folks when she was lonely in a snow forest whose only friend was Puck.\r\nBetween you and me, I was ready for something mindblowing to be revealed, I'm the only one to blame for extra hyping this, it was all a rushed mediocre, normal-looking setup that the authors probably needed to resolve.

But then again, I can never predict what I'll watch in the next 5 minutes, but for now, I'm having this as the downfall of it all.\r\nIt felt rather like those old ambitious but crappy AMV from the old youtube poop background, with no matching music or purpose but to transition from random shots of the series, be them relevant or not, they looked badass, so why not?\n\r\n- Art (4/10):\r\nTheoriginal series (which is what this short is based upon) didn't have the greatest art style and/or animation out there, however, the quality never suffered despite that. It was beautiful in its own way. \u201cHellsing: Psalm of Darkness\u201d includes various shots from the series, however, the bad context and flashy swift transition don't leave room for the old not-so-fluid animation to breath, if anything, that sudden switch only makes the image kind of blur and drops from its quality.\n\r\n- Sound (2/10):\r\nYep, not a single thing to praise. Voice acting wasn't it here, very few snippets from various contexts all over the parent series with no particular juxtaposition, not one that's painfully obvious that is.\r\nThe music wasn't that good either, should I even call it music? A bunch of random noises trying to make some sense.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (5/10):\r\nI'm very picky when it comes to short duration guilty pleasure. And \u201cHellsing: Psalm of Darkness\u201d reminded me of the reason why. I loved Hellsing, both the original and the remake, watched all the other OVAs and what not and had no complaint, biot not until I fall upon watching this, and there I was, staring at this pile of disappointment and bashing an ignorant eye on it as if it never happened. Perhaps that was the right thing to do from the start. One thing, however, there was a distinguishable sequencial event from what appear to be respecting the same order as the parent show, where it really helped serve a great refresher on the big plot points of the earlier adaptation for that I'm thankful.\n\r\n- Overall (3.6/10):\r\nEven for 3 minutes, it was a huge waste of time and energy, a pathetic insult to the great franchise of Hellsing. The mere idea of having this kind of low-quality trash as a standalone release is just so infuriating and disappointing at the same time.\n"

When binge-watching episodes backto back, recaps seem to be a turn-off, so you'd really want to skip on them and win time. That is unless the recap has some fun twist around it, but in SAO II Debriefing, it was not.\n\r\nThe recap episode is a barebones retelling of the entire Phantom Bullet arc from Sinon's perspective, with some minimal narration at the beginning, ending up at when she finally overcame her hardships.\n"

            "content": "\n                \"Once upon a time, one of the worst Anime adaptations existed\", fixed that for you, MyAnimeList.\r\nBut seriously though, it's laughable how I remember my anticipation of the show from ready its synopsis before it was released, it's like that one movie you keep anticipating for a month until you're satisfied after having watched it. But Fairy Gone overwrote that kind of feeling for me by giving me a life-long implication for what to come. It was partly my fault, but Anime itself was no innocent angel either.\r\nOriginally planned to span 24 episodes, it was later announced that it was going to be a split courof 2 parts, I don't know if that was the right thing to do to save a doomed adaptation like this, but it could go either way. Giving you a breather between the two parts to only torture you back again might be some of the evilest things ever, but it could also turn out to be a change for the better, exactly the kind of change I'm hopeful for.\n\r\n- Story (3.5/10):\r\nCalling it a story would be a stupid kind of a stretch. I could not for the love of God grasp anything. Too many locations, too many dates, lots of names dropping on us all the time, remember when watching an Anime was about having fun? It felt like a painful chore in this show's case.\r\nThe show really had great potential, and it's easily apparent by just ready the initial synopsis, if anything, it was a matter of bad direction. Way to underestimate what bad pacing can do to the flow of the story. Every event starts off by kicking fast pace action composed of random shots of many characters, each doing their thing, but then, and with no prior notice, you find yourself listening to the narrator telling you how it ended in an annoying third person pov, almost spoonfeeding you the story the way they want you to, the worst type of gatekeeping.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nUndoubtedly, the only good thing going for this God forsaken adaptation. But at what price? I guess that what happens when you have way too much budget dedicated to a single department.\r\nTo say the least, Fairy Gone still retained a status of what a modern Anime should be like, visually at least, but lacked every other rule of thumb that makes an actual Anime worthy of one's time.\r\nThe character designs and the background and how both blend so well were definitely the stars of the show. The cast of characters looks like a group of first-class models, very pleasing to the eye at least. The background feels lively and very well blended into the scenes. It could have been easily the best-animated show of the season with a great deal of consistency between the episodes, however, the horror of horrifying CG struck like there was no tomorrow. The Fairies, the thing that made ready the synopsis hype the show for me looked like true nightmares. CG can be bad, but this? They better re-think their choices for the second cour of the series.\r\nThe high paced fight scenes that made most of the latter part of the series were on a standpoint of production, very good. But something that reeks of negativity rendered every effort put on them useless. They pretty much felt like though shitty AMV compilations you see so often on Youtube. Cool characters exchanging blows while a party banger of a song is playing on top with an out of sync volume. It just didn't feel right.\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nGood enough to keep up with the great visuals, average voice acting, and good opening and ending theme songs. Those both definitely found a decent following in between the fans.\r\nThe soundtracks were lively, nothing revolutionary thought.\n\r\n-  Character (2/10):\r\nJust how bad could this have been?\r\nYou would think that at least one character out of the mass would strike the cool-dude/cool-girl vibes, and in terms of character designs, they definitely did. But God were they some of the most one-dimensional characters ever. No character development whatsoever throughout the serialization, at least, none that matter. The protagonist set off for a goal at first, 3 episodes later, they abandoned what they set off for altogether and never tackle it again.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (6/10):\r\nIt felt more or less like a grid to me. Just like when you boot up a game in your steam library just so it doesn't remain unplayed, I really had high hopes for this show, it turned out I should be more careful doing research before I dedicate valuable time to a series.\n\r\n- Overall (5.4/10):\r\nLong story short, just stay away from this. At least for now, until a better cour is released, you don't want to grind through both cours with a down expression on your face, unless you really hate yourself that much.\n"

            "content": "\n                Let's get one thing straight, Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari Season 2 is as average and mediocre as it gets. The animation was so run-of-the-mill that I had to check multiple times if I was watching the right show. The sound department didn't do any better either, with nothing but a generic background score that didn't even try to elevate the scenes. As for the characters, I didn't even care about their existence, let alone their development. I'm sure the writers thought they were adding depth and complexity, but in reality, they were just adding layers of boredom.\n\r\nThe story was nothing but a rehash ofthe same old tired trope of a hero trying to save the world, but without any charm or originality. The pacing was all over the place, making the first half a complete snooze-fest that put me to sleep multiple times. However, the second half was a different story altogether. It was interesting, engaging, and probably on par with the best arcs from the first season. If only they had cut the first half short and focused on the second, the show could have been so much better.\n\r\nDespite all its flaws, I still managed to enjoy Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari Season 2. Maybe it's because I'm a glutton for punishment, or maybe it's because the second half was just that good. Whatever the reason, I can't deny that I had some fun watching it. So, I'm giving it a 6.97/10, and you may be wondering, why such a weird rating? Well, I did some quick math, and it turns out that's the average of all the scores I gave for animation, sound, characters, story, pacing, and enjoyment.\n\r\nI gotta say, though, the opening song was definitely a highlight for me. It had me jamming out every time it came on. But, overall, I can't help but wonder if this show has fallen under the mediocre bar. I mean, season one was pretty good, but this one just didn't quite hit the mark for me. That being said, I still enjoyed it and think it's worth a watch for fans of the series.\n\r\nOverall: 6.97/10.\n"

Beats me.\n\r\nThe only thing worth checking out about the recap is the after credits compilation of some of the shots from the show coupled with the \u201ccorrect\u201d sound effects, I wish they had that on the entire episode, it would have been worth it at last.\n\r\nReally, the recap is just M and Pito narrating over what went on the first Squad Jam, sort of like a couch-conversation style.Still, not worth your time. However, watching it through, it really shows how little happened in the first 5 episodes, truly the trashiest kind of entertainment, I love it.

Demon Slayer taught us all a lesson, a mediocre story can lead the top of charts with a single consistent and high budget adaptation, however, not only did Jujutsu Kaisen follow on its steps, but it had a better grasp of itsplots and characters.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nAs far as the season got, the story still foggs off the premise it tries to present, it has a sense of great progression but at the same time, it feels like everything is frozen in a time-capsule.\r\nThe events tend to move at an astronomical speed almost feels like skipping on important stuff but that also leads to short, concise arcs that never drag or get bland at all. I can vouch that Jujutsu Kaisen is by no means a storytelling masterpiece, it remains as simple as one can grasp while half-asleep and redirects all extra buildups to the characters instead. It's crazy how the show can make you feel mixe vibes between early Naruto and Bleach while also maintaining its very own identity with a unique power system that feeds off from HunterxHunter's excellent take on power scaling and battle composition.\n\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nOnly a mad man would give this one below a perfect-10. Very clear to the blind, a lot has gone into the visual fidelity of this show, lesson learned, Demon Slayer. The show can feel very wholesome and calm with the incredible use of lightning and bright colors making you believe you're watching a relaxing slice of life only for it in a moment notice turning off all the sweet lights and effect, casting everything under a rusty dark shadow that feels out of a Saw acting set. The atmosphere delivered is just incredible, very believable, and almost a breathing character of its own, whether it's in the heart of a non-where forest or miles underground too deep into an abandoned sewer system, the vibe of danger always wraps the characters involved, always upping up the stakes.\r\nThe animation that goes through every fight scene was in a league of its own in this season, with amazing choreography and dynamic camera movement to the point of a simple eye reveal being better animated than 80% of the airing shows.\n\r\nSound (10/10):\r\nAs mesmerizing, the animation was, no one can simply gloss over how equally astonishing the audible capabilities of this show were, a work of art.\r\nLet's talk openings and endings, not a single one, no, not a single second one any of them was below amazing. The first opening won the fandom by the first screening. Then the first ending song followed with no breaks in between, breaking the meme economy and inspiring countless covers and spin-offs and it did not stop at that, the second opening and ending were impossibly just as good, that is a feat in an of its own.\r\nThe voice acting was also that good, it really felt like a high production show just from the main AND side cast alone, starring several big names in the industry. I love how the show broke some conventions that we rarely see happen, including English rap into its wide OST collection, not shying from building up to its hype.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nIt feels so suffocating not to give this one a third 10/10 in a single row, the only reason being, bad and boring villains.\r\nWhen we talk about Shounen, it's an iconic thing to have the first batch of villains memorable and fear-inducing enough to motivate the characters in the early stages of the story, unfortunately, Jujutsu Kaisen misses badly on this one, especially with Mahito who gets an insane hype built around him only to turn up as an unappealing try-hard that does not check any of the boxes of what an incredible early-game villain should.\r\nOn the bright side, the main and side cast are just starting on their own, not a single character was introduced turned up to be forgotten an episode later, they feel like real people, they have motives, backstories, and charisma fun enough to make you wanting more.\r\nOne of the best things about this show is how amazingly the female characters are written, some of the best that sprouted from a Shounen series, I have yet to see a female character sexualize and low-balled enough to be utilized as generic comic relief. Strength and badassery favor no gender in this show and that alone is very refreshing and worthy of praise on its own.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nAs much of a great show this was, not a moment of dull content was experienced, however, there were too many things left unclear that impacted my enjoyment of the series. Maybe a sequel will help clear things up, but for the moment, a lot of plot holes if you will have been bothering my enjoyment, but the show already checked on some of the most important elements that make a show a great and iconic one, this is a show that will keep being talked about for years to come.\n\r\nOverall (8.8/10):\r\nI don't know how the amount of hype that followed the series from day one did not make you curious enough to check out the show for yourself, but here's another reassurance. I don't recommend anything on a whim, not even a 2 minutes long Youtube video, but this is definitely a show made to be recommended.\n"

            "content": "\n                It's no surprise to anyone, no matter how or when the name Psycho-Pass is brought up, the fandom is perfectly in agreement, season one gets all the praise, season two, let's just pretend it doesn't exist, and the movie, it's there. The fandom is mostly quote, and has been ever since the movie was out, but then, the trilogy SS Case movies were announced, and season 3 announcement followed shortly.\n\r\nSeason 2 left quite the bad taste in our tongue, and as much as we all wanted more of Psycho-Pass, we saw the trilogy as a filter fan service that we're not that much afraid ofto further taint the reputation of the franchise, but then, the third season just confirmed a canonical follow up to the story. The fans were afraid that it would suck, worst-case scenario, more than season two even did, but hopefully, it did not.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nTo a barebone level, Psycho-Pass 3 tackles the same action detective thriller that makes up the identity of the franchise. It tries to apt-up the stakes to new grounds, it expands on everything presented on the earlier entries, however, it felt like it overwhelmed itself in its own lore and complex world that it's visible on the confused pacing it runs on. At times, it feels like the slowest slice of life out there with convoluted dialogue and boring background, but in other times it's head-on a sonic incarnation, lots of stuff happening and constant cut-outs to different places and times, it definitely requires more attention and effort to follow than it makes for an enjoyable watch. It feels like a chore.\r\nAlso, the whole supernatural telekinesis wizardry was a big cheat no-no for me.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nPsycho-Pass has always had a consistent delivery when it came to the visuals, I mean, the studio behind it is a pretty capable one.\n\r\nI feel like with this third season, it only reaffirmed how consistent it is visually, while it added nothing new to the formula, I would say it's just as good as it's ever looked. I guess the art style they go with doesn't allow for much, the realistic depiction of anatomy and environment is probably it's biggest quirk and restriction at the same time.\n\r\nCGI has been utilized so much in the series that sometimes, the drawings would make up no more than 30% of the scene's composition, however, while not the best, it never looks too horrible, aside from the city-opened environment.\n\r\nSound (8.8/10):\r\nAgain, hitting us with an absolute party banger for an opening, the song is classy, and the visuals couldn't be more faithful to what we're used to.\r\nThe ending theme song is also just as good, very emotional, and nostalgic in a way.\r\nThe voice acting is, good. I wouldn't say spectacular just because talents like Seki Tomokazu, Sakurai Takahiro, Arimoto Kinryuu, and Hanazawa Kana were barely present if at all.\r\nThe OG OST makes frequent returns which us always a plus in my book.\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\r\nLet's just agree that the first season, in both protagonists and antagonists, set up a skyscraping standard no just for its franchise but in the industry. Unfortunately, season two could not live up to that hype, and probably that was its biggest weakness, however, season three, along with the prequel trilogy did hammer it down to a decent degree.\n\r\nArata and Kei are a good addition to the rooster, however, they lack something. Arata is a fun character, very easy-going, and looks very approachable, with Kei being more of a \u201cmeh\u201d mannequin, at least for the first half of the show until he receives proper focus and development.\n\r\nThe appearance of Kougami and Akane felt more like fanservice cameos than functioning members of the plot that can alter the events at display.\r\nI would say Mika has found some redemption, not as close to being dislikable as she was in the second season, but maybe because she had minimal screentime herself.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.2/10):\r\nIf it weren't for the cherry experience, man, this would have been closed the first season. Not until the last 3 or so episodes, it did not have that defining Psycho-Pass mark, so the overwhelming majority of it felt very far from home. Another drawback, or at least for me, is the length of the episodes, I would have had an easier time if it followed the generic 24 minutes episode, because man does it become crazy and hard to follow given its 45 minutes length.  And then there is the ending.\n\r\nOverall (7.6/10):\r\nWell, I guess, we did ask for more, I would say if you have the same mindset, go for it. However, I would also say, it is more difficult to follow and complex compared to what we're used to from the franchise, maybe because it's one giant case all through, unlike the \u201cmini-cases that turn out to be related\u201d kind of progression.\r\nI mean, Kougami, there you go. Although, don't expect a full-on fashion screening from him.\n"

Vampire stories are, in fact, a dying genre when it comes to the modern Anime game, and most of them can't help but stick to the predictable clich\u00e9 fest known as the Twighlight bind curse.\r\n\u201cShiki\u201d is probably one of the most popular shows that embrace the Vampire trope in this soon-to-end decade (as of writingthis review), perhaps it was attempting to revive a fading genre that has been lost between the blood thrilling overly hyped battle Shounen that it went unnoticed under the mainstream scene, and we love to hate everything that's mainstream, or at least, a large portion of the fandom does, and for obvious reasons. Maybe Shiki was meant to be one of the last landmarks to be remembered from the 2010's Vampires scene, that or it was a clever marketing ploy that jumped on the Vampires hype with the popularity of the Twilight movies at the time; luckily, the two franchises share less in between than the mention of Vampires.\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nMainly, one would see the shaky progression of the story as a trigonometrical graph, hitting the bedrock floor at times and piercing past Everest at other times. But that's not necessarily a flaw in the blueprint of the story per se, but the borderless writing and bad character direction had a big hand in the matter to blame.\r\nNot too long after the Kirishiki family moved into a castle at Sobota village, people started mysteriously dying due to some sort of epidemic as labeled by the village's doctor, Ozaki.\r\nOf course, being an irrational man, and a person of science, he approaches the matter within logical boundaries and slowly as logic thinking was of no help, the involvement of Vampires like creatures called Shiki was called off as a plausible cause; the occult upbringing slapped him like nothing else.\r\nSoon after, the calm and cozy village was no more, and an angry, partly immoral crusade flamed between the two sides, both killed by the name of survival and hanging to dear life.\r\nBut that was only one perspective into the greater narrative pipeline, as Dr. Ozaki's journal isn't the only one to swear by.\r\nFifteen years old boy named Natsuno and his family also happened to move in around the same time as the Kirishiki. His first reaction wasn't too fond of this boring rural hell he was dragged into by his parents (as he interpreted it), but later, he befriends a guy around his same age who shortly later falls victim to the mysterious epidemic, which fueled his curiosity to expose the real truth behind their silent sudden death.\n\r\nThe psychological horror side of things benefits heavily on the nicely paced flow of events. Never too slow or too fast given the situation. The frequent cuts and time jumps that forward or sometimes backward time in hours; sometimes days intervals, exposing the dates and the matching mood according to the character in the spotlights, labeled as lucky or unlucky which helps the urgency and adds in a fair touch of anticipation and risk.\n\r\nA huge selling point of the show is the fluent transition between happy scenes and tense ones, the addition of classic film trickery such as film grain, shaky camera, and color distortion, bundled with a creepy collection of humming and childish singing spike the scene on display to new heights, crafting some of the best moments in my experience of Anime.\n\r\nShiki is a story about struggling for survival, it paints the Shiki side as black, while the struggling human appeared pure white, only to shift the stakes between them back and forth, empathizing with both sides, without enclosing who's right and who's wrong. Perhaps the dead should have never returned or perhaps the living should have had more of an open-minded understanding, and both strived for co-existent in harmony. But this is no utopia. This is a brutal conflict that crossed the moral boundaries, built upon the idea of moral challenging thoughts that prices killing a demon as becoming one yourself.\n\r\nArt (8.5/10):\r\nStorytelling comes in all types and forms, visual, audible, well, that's all about what I know, you get the idea, but even in those specific types lies a huge variety of improvisation and going about inclining a sense of individuality for conveying a story. On a visual note, Shiki does not roll the eyes very well on the first glances. Characters are clunky, with pointy edges and fragile-looking bodies that resemble dolls more than they do proper humans. Hairstyles are all over the place, very messy and random with no attachment to movements or physics whatsoever. It did throw me off a couple of times at first, but the other aspects of the show make up greatly for it to the point it's not that noticeably straining on the eye.\n\r\nI gotta give credits to the use of colors. A lucky day might benefit heavily from the bright, saturated color palettes, while the unlucky counterparts get so washed up sometimes it's almost a withered black and white film; matted with grain and deliberate roll corruption that help sell the disturbing shots. Speaking of disturbing, have I stressed enough on how disgustingly horrifying some of those shots looked? Manacing, the sight of rotten flesh, scrubby skin, and poppy eyes make for an incredible addition to the horror side of the story, coupled with close-ups and corner shots camera trickery, Oh my God, some of the most intense moments were captured like that.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nAnother big aspect to praise for the show, it's the vocal capability to steer the mood of the scene upside down just by letting loose to a creepy girly humming, the master-class build-up of tense tracks that accompany each big scene and of course, a great voice acting staff that knew what they were doing.\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs are also one to keep and add to a playlist, although, speaking of the first opening theme song, it was an odd one, one that made you question it inclusion in the first place until you start humming along with it once you get used to it. Good stuff.\r\nA setting that involves Vampires is sure to have a lot of scream and panic moments, moments that require the characters to show stutter in their speech pattern and cry-worthy mental breakdowns, and to that, the staff made a spectacular performance when it came to conveying those kinds of emotions.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nThis one is controversial. A lot of people shit on the key characters of this show, and for obvious reasons, I can actually get behind that, but what would a 15 years old teenager or a science-bound doctor do against an occult attack anyways? Those were in some way realistic approaches that frankly could have had a better turnout, but instead, all of the build-up they were leading to went into vain at the end.\r\nDon't put a lot of bet on characters, especially the teenage ones that happen to make a decent amount of characters. They are young, immature, inexperience. Of course, they would make dumb mistakes, it only reflects on their age. As of Dr. Ozaki, he is dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that defies the very core of his science-related profession, it was a battle of acceptance at first until he put on the serious hat and dealt with it his own unexpectedly twisted way.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nLike any other freshly started Anime series. I had my skepticism in place, I did not expect anything grand or too ambitious, I just picked up a random series on my plan-to-watch list after it collected dust for nearly 3 years, and ended up sweating on the edge of my seat on more than rare occasions. What have I been sleeping on all of this time!\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nShiki tells a story about conflicting morals, a battle to decide what's wrong and what's right, who's evil and who's not, I did not expect that to rhyme. Not minding the odd visual choices and the often questionable character direction, Shiki, more than not improvised against its very own script, and delivers some unpredictable turnouts that keep you hanging to the tip of the portrayed moments.\n"

The plot's as juicy as a goblin's giblets and the animation will knock your socks off! I mean, the CG (raises eyebrow) goblins may not have the finest animation, but their presence adds a touch of the absurd that'll have you in stitches.\n\r\nAnd let's not forget about the music, with both an opening and a closing theme, it's like a double scoop of ice cream on a hot summer day! But the real star of the show is Clementine, she's like a one-woman army, constantly getting destroyed and yet still managing to be oneof the most popular characters in the Overlord universe.\n\r\nAnd just when you think you've seen it all, BAM! A second ending theme hits you out of nowhere, it's like a gut-punch from Albedo herself. Overall, if you're a fan of Overlord, you're in for a treat, and if you're not, well, you're missing out on the fun!\n"

            "content": "\n                If Shounen had a rival when talk comes to popularity numbers, it would probably be the Isekai genre, specifically relating to the recent years. As far as we can remember, Mecha was huge back in the day too, but an occurring familiar face to everyone is Harem, a genre that makes a boom every once in a while before it dips down and loses notice against the endless seasonal charts which says a lot about the genre itself. It is hard to sell, hard to come by, but when a good, solid Harem show drops in, it occupies a big spotlight in the seasonal scene.Although every show has to have a defining selling point to have an audience (Taking apart your usual guilty pleasure trash), a Harem show can't really screw with the formula or it might end up being way too hung up on what genre it identifies as and eventually get caught up in the unfortunate loophole of \u201cwhat the heck is this show even is\u201d.\r\nThanks to the daunting constant five-set rules of thumb that a Harem show is most likely composed of; (1) Plain and relatable (In most cases poor) main character, (2) drawn-out drama that feeds off of misunderstood out-of-context happenings, (3) competitive love interests, (4) a beach/hot spring episode (Although a lot of unrelated shows also love to borrow this one out), (5) and finally a highschool setting. Pretty much, most of the related shows out there are just a reskin of the same plot, only with different names, and sometimes (putting in the work in the \u201ccopy my homework but change some things so they don't look similar\u201d deal) quirky backstories. 5-toubun no Hanayome goes beyond that in not only abiding by the \u201cfive\u201d rules of thumb of what makes its genre but also (being overly proud to its identity) having it in its name. But as they say. Don't judge a book by its cover, or an Anime by its title, genre, description... you get the idea, judging way too early can pass you off some pleasurable entertainment in the Anime scene, and that goes also for the 3 episodes rule, it's not justifiable in this Anime given its special setting, but hear me out...\n\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nGiven its genre, it's pretty apparent what type of predictable plot this show has, it's in its DNA, an unescaped curse that was bound to it the moment its author came up with the idea that is the \u201c5-toubun no Hanayome\u201d, or at least, that's the impression it gives off. We're at a point where even the industry-defining phenominal known as \u201cShounen\u201d is evolving into something new and refreshing, and thankful, a lot of aspiring works took that wise note and made slight changes to relate to the present days.\r\nFirst, we start off very basic. A hardworking smart student that has his own daily run due to his family's terrible financial condition is assigned to tutor a group of classmates that happen to be quintuplets, already mixing a welcomed surprise to the formula. Of course, all of them take an average first impression on the guy, until they all start to realize the feelings they have grown for him, but what really pulls everything together is the lack of fighting between them, sort of what happens between every other love competitors in other shows, as their sisterly side makes sure they are all perfectly tied and holding hands at all times. But what shall they do, when all of them are identical quintuplets, where every sister puts the others before herself? That was the biggest theme that the plot makes hints at occasionally. As they picked awareness that not only themselves but also their loved siblings are developing the same feelings towards the same guy, should they be longing for the charming prince, or should they consider one another, and raise a supportive flag instead?\r\nThe story progress at a considerable pace, making sure that the development is apparent, even on the episodic level, which makes comparing the same characters with what they were an episode ago very rewarding and satisfying at times, that is of course, speaking more about their love quest, and less about their academic progression.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI would say, artwise, it is definitely not the strongest point this Anime has going for it, but it does the work done. For a 2019 animation, it left a lot to be desired, but the average looking art doesn't hurt the eye so bad like some of the shows did this year *cough* Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyou *cough*. For the most part, it makes it easier on the visual side to follow the plot, the shacky consistency with the quality does sometimes throw the viewer off, but it's at least very rare that it doesn't matter anyway. However, and that's a big pause to my squared rant. Sometimes, the visuals strike a steep raise in quality, that you're almost looking at a high-quality premium wallpaper that entice you to stop the episode and have an extensive stare at how good the visuals look like. It's a day-and-night comparition that knocks you off your senses, back to the average-looking animation that honestly wouldn't look so poorly inconsistent if it wasn't for those sudden visual drugs the show strikes you with occasionally.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nMy first reaction wasn't a proud one, especially after I loke the show the way I do after finishing it. I was very unimpressed with how clunky the main character's voice sounded to me, the enthusiasm wasn't there, the face of the protagonist and his voice did not match up for me, it was as listening to a performance of an overworked amature that's half-asleep after a lengthy day of work. The girls' performances were very catchy and daring, even though they had the same appearance from a third perspective point, their voice speak a lot about their varying characteristics and treats.\r\nI'm always welcoming a good score in my daily playlist, and this show was made it there from the first episode. Both the opening and ending theme songs were amazing. Remaining on the same atmosphere that the show drives.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI wasn't very charmed when I first started watching this show, but as I considered the quintuplet gimmick that it embarrasses, it got me very interested in knowing more. They are quintuplets, after all, that is, their bodies are similar, but nothing gets in the way of them not leaving a different and memorable vibe. There is Ichika the big sister, that speaks with a more mature tone, and emits a strange, almost motherly aura whenever she's in the spotlight. There is Itsuki, the stubborn, honest and caring one. Yotsuba, the over-active hyper-energetic, hardworking athletic type that adds in fun and laughter whenever she's there. Miku (My favorite one), being the shy and socially awkward one, and finally (My least favorite), the violent Tsundere that hates to admit defeat and her overly protective side would go as far as drugging you to sleep if it meant to save her sisters. All of them leave off a distinguishable, lovable (in the same ways) treats that leave the fans in constant wars on which one IS the Mary Sue that should finally marry the protagonist some day.\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\r\nFor once, I never expected to get this much of an attachment with the show, as I only started it after picking it up on a whim to binge watch in the weekend (Ended up watching it my pace the entire week which I do no regret). It has sincerely been a long time since a show has filled me with uncontrollable chills that kept me swinging my body left and right at some points of the story, the likes of which I never imagined a Harem show would give me. Definitely one of the best Harem shows I watched. I can't wait for the second season to air.\n\r\nOverall (8.1/10):\r\nYes. That would be my answer if you were to ask me \u201dShould I watch this show?\u201d. It is genuinely that good. Refreshing and faithful to what it set out itself to be, I really can't stress how much of a great Harem is in simple words. Here I am writing this review only minutes from finishing watching session, and already thinking about what would be the right time for a re-watch before the second season airs, which happens to be around a month from now.\n"

Something you don't always get from sequels, in most cases your nostalgia would lead you to believe that the first season will always be superior no matter what, but no with this. there is an undeniable quality raise in this season, and that's apparent from the get-go.\r\nNoragami Aragoto was an improvement on top of the first season, Noragami, while the art style maintained its memorable quality, and the soundtracks too, the plot has seen some really exciting rollercoaster action, talking the IT languages, let's encrypt...\n\r\n- Story (9.2/10):\r\nThe first season was where it all started, but despite the massive information we gotout of it, we were still left with so many unanswered questions to fill up a library.\r\nNoragami Aragoto focuses on the origin of our protagonist Yato, where he originated from, and what made him the person he is now, what happened between him and Veen. It even dives deeper to explain some of the obscure stuff about the Nora that keeps appearing in front of him with no prior warning.\r\nTo say the least, the story progressing in this season was far superior to the first's, whereas Noragami did deliver some really solid plot points, this is where the real hype resides, I mean every episode was filled with stuff interesting enough to shake the whole comment section.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nI can't really complain, or else I would deserve to be smacked on the face, other shows would kill for this kind of care when it comes to animation.\r\nI don't think it's any friction far superior to the first season's, but the quality remains and shines even more in fight scenes.\r\nEverything from the opening and ending themes visuals, to the stunning fluid animation, to the stillest shots there are, nothing feels unfitting or unpleasant to look at, you're just being gift a great animation that keeps up the pace, and lets you focus on what's happening, not bad to let you disappointed, and not too outstanding to distract you either.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI misjudged the first season's soundtrack before and given it a lower score than this one, how rushful was I, I only got to notice to moving, how involved it was in this season, seeing how they kept the old OST.\r\nOne of the things I was upset about when finishing the first season, was missing the opening, that was was spectacular, I dove in with zero expectation for this season's opening theme song, but was greeted with an even better one, oh, how many times I screamed along the lyrics at the beginning of each episode, it was just phenomenal. This should make me lose some points at those \u201cTry not to sign\u201d challenges.\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\r\nWhile keeping the old cast of characters, but with extras, being that they are no longer too annoying like Hiyori and Yukine were to some people, they really grew more mature and understanding, in a good way of course. Veena was really given a huge attention here, explaining her treats, dissecting her attitude and all, along with her servants.\r\nA lot of other new characters were introduced too, that remained appealing from the moment of their introduction. more people to love other than Yato,\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.1/10):\r\nI can definitely confirm that I did enjoy this season more than the first one, and I really dug the first one. unlike the first, every episode had many things to hook you on, I love the cliffhangers, and even more so the fast-paced storytelling, really makes you beg for a third season.\n\r\n- Overall (9.0/10):\r\nIf the first season would have left me hesitant from recommending it to my fellow friends, this season alone makes me want to shove the franchise up their faces. Yes, I would say, this is a must watch for modern Anime series, because honestly, it's rare to find some really good shows these days.\n"

It slowly starts luring the viewer's mind until it drops a bomb of astonishment on them, now, I've watched a tremendous amount of fiction, and I never ever had the chance to see something as cool as a person awakening into somebody else's body executing this well. that was me trying to summarise the initiative plot without having to reveal too much if you're the sci-fi guy, that might have teased you a bit int checking this one up.\n\r\n- Art (7/10):\r\nI'm going to come straight and say it, the art looks kind of weird, but, hey, weird in an interesting way?! perhaps it was just my first experience with the type of art that led me to set a score this average for this pick, but it's worth noting that it's not by any means bad, it's something you can get used to, not the realistic way, of course, the artists went for a kind of artistic approach, the way they modeled the character's anatomy, the sluggish movements, and all, but I got to admit, they nailed the CG part, freaking killed it, man!\n\r\n- Sound (7/10):\r\nI might be the one to say this, the audio part is not the strongest aspect of this animation, the voice acting was great and all, but aside from that, everything was just, you know, meh-like, I have no complaint of course, but at the same time, it's nothing that caught my ears that much.\n\r\n- Characters (8/10):\r\nFor such a short story, and a very narrow veriety of characters, it does take a delicious peice of story out of the remains, I don't have any problems without characters, usually you'd have a braty or very immature protagonists, but in this one, you really feel the realistic side of them, you feel the lived sould inside of them, there is a fear of death and defeat, the relashionships between the personnels are also interesting, I never seen a more awkward sibling since the last time I watched \u201cNo game no life\u201d, and this pair really nailed it.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8/10)\r\nI've watched a lot of amazing shows lately, and that left me with a great fear of ever starting a new show, and then realizing it never stood up to my top X picks, but I've come to understand that what makes a masterpiece into one, is the fact that it stands up, and the fact that it's rare and hard to match, now I did enjoy this movie, in fact, it only made me watch to ask for more, now, if this were to be made into an official series, I'd blindely dive in, the world seemes very interesting to explore, and the lore is just too crazy that I started to get some \u201cNo game no life\u201d flash backs trying to relate the two with one another, you gte introduced to a lot of consepts and terms like \u201cThe U.S military standard tactical mobile anti-personnel machines, Wardogs\u201d, yes, that's how serious and complicated it gets.\r\nthis was just an amazing half an hour, if only there were some more well-composed stories out there.\n\r\n- Overall (7.5/10):\r\nI'm really left disappointed about the fact that this is a standalone animation, with no confirmed sequels or anything to fill the whole of confusion that was left into me after finishing watching this show, would I recommend it? definitely, a quick refresher of how amazing sci-fi anime shows can get, just get some popcorn, and before you know it, the 24 minutes long,g movie would be long gone, the popcorn bowl would have been long stolen away by a sibling of yours while you were left questioning your life after being so invested into a story that could have been much greater if there was a completion to it.\n"

            "content": "\n                As a fan of both the Baki series and cup noodles, I was excited to see Nissin team up with Baki Hanma for their latest commercial. The commercial features Yujiro Hanma, the strongest character in the Baki series, as a tailed beast-like creature that disrupts the peaceful meal of a salary man. The commercial promotes Nissin's Saikyou Donbei cup noodles, which are advertised as having thicker noodles than the regular Donbei products.\n\r\nThe commercial itself was a lot of fun to watch. The animation style was great, and it was cool to see Yujiro Hanma in a different form than what we're used to seeing inthe anime. The commercial also did a great job of showcasing the features of the Saikyou Donbei cup noodles and making them look delicious.\n\r\nOne thing that stood out to me was how well the commercial captured the spirit of the Baki series. Even though it was a commercial and not an actual episode of the anime, it still felt like it fit right in with the series. The humor was on point and the action scenes were well choreographed.\n\r\nOverall, I thought this commercial was great. It was entertaining, well-animated, and did a great job of promoting Nissin's new Saikyou Donbei cup noodles. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're a fan of Baki or cup noodles.\n\r\nAs a side note, Nissin is well known for their creative and interesting commercials, This one is no exception, the way they incorporated Baki into it was really well done, it was funny and the animation was really smooth. It's always fun to see how Nissin does their commercials and this one is no exception.\n"

            "content": "\n                Up until this point, Bleach had always had bad luck at adapting anything outside of its main TV series, the movies, the specials, everything just had to suck one way or the other, so when I heard of Burn The Witch, Kubo Tite's new One-Shot getting an animation short series, I had my doubts, and so, I help on the hype, I gave it time, and only decide to watch it recently, maybe, anything I was fearing would not come to pass. And man, did Kubo ever slapped me this hard since the early days of Bleach.\n\r\nStory (7.5/10):\r\nI'm only going for what I saw onthese three episodes, because had it been a tad longer and more things were explore, this would have been an easy 8 if not more. These three episodes felt like the Romance Dawn arc of One Piece, it's super short, it has the spirit, but does not tell everything, no, no way near half of everything. You feel like setting the stone into a grand world build on top of Bleach's, but which entirely new and more expressive lore that followed everything thing. This felt like if Ghibli Studio were to animate a series instead of a movie more than not.\n\r\nArt (9.2/10):\r\nClose to perfection. The art style is there, the color palette, also there, the animation is dynamic and fluid, and the cinematography and camera angles were not of an average Anime screening. This was the best any of Kubo Tite's animate characters looked, and I hope it's a ten that will follow with the 1000 years blood arc of Bleach, Inshallah.\r\nThe characters felt really, really fresh and new, but also very familiar and nostalgic, I guess Kubo is one of the few Mangaka that persists his signature art even as he improves it. Also, more of a reminder that Kubo really did miss a promising future as a fashion designer because the clothing and customs here are a moo of their own.\n\r\nSound (8.3/10):\r\nI did not notice anything out of place, audibly speaking, the voice acting was sharp and great, the emotions were delivered, the passive-aggressive commentary was there and hit the comedic effect they aimed at, such a shame that no opening song came with this, but the ending was a great pleasurable treat.\r\nThe OSTs were good and felt organic and part of the scenes, however, not quite on Bleach's level, to say the least.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nObviously, we saw no character development \u201cthat mattered\u201d in these three episodes, but it's fine as the start of the story is yet to unfold.\r\nThe cast however is very varying and alive, with different characters with different interactions and charisma, never a dull moment of a boring conversation.\r\nThe main duo, Noelle and Nina was just the right nail to seal this story, both great in opposing ways, which keeps it interesting and fresh, with countless of Shounen that features males as the primary main characters, it's about time we saw things differently from a protagonistic female ^point of view.\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\r\nThree episodes were never going to be enough for this great showing. I certainly I not feel like I was gonna enjoy this this much, but I'm glad I did.\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nThat I better than was anticipating. Kudos to Kubo sensei for this new work, and looking forward to featuring sequels. An for you non-Bleach fans, this might still pull you in, even if you're not fans of Kubo's earlier works.\n"

The long-awaited OVA episode that promised to bring along the uncensored version of this shitfest of a fan-serving haven.\n\r\nI was happy, so happy to hear the opening and ending theme songs again after several months, it was strange, filling me with excitement, a bit of sadness, and a whole lot of guilty nostalgia. It was undoubtedly the best part of this OVA. However, the first frame of the uncensored goodness hit me harder than my pp wasduring my first binge-watch. \u201cThis shit is uncensored now?\u201d\n\r\nI don't know what I was expecting, but my man down there was sure happy while I stared at him in disappointment, reassuring my hands a great evening.\r\nI survived.\n\r\nIt is so refreshing hearing these voices again, having watched a lot of heavy narrative shows lately, a guilty pleasure trashy show like this was just what I needed.\n"

The odd alteration of bright color that flawlessly catches your attention on every frame only complimented by the fluid movements and the classy dances moves that flows nicelywith the beat. It feels very 80-ish in its rocky atmosphere, the sort of you'd find at a crowded club from the era.\n\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nThe music is pretty much the \u201ccheerleading queen\u201d of the special. Without a doubt, just like the animation with its dated feel (Dated but really good), it does hold up to the same amount of quality, obviously, I don't speak Japanese, at least, not at the native level, so, me grasping the lyrics was out of the question, however, the beat and rhymes were enough to have me appreciate the treat my ears were getting.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nThat was just my kind of treat on a moody day like this one, I forgot the cold weather I was hiding from under my pile of warm blankets and went straight up into a mindless dancing imitation rampage, soothing I could much the professional leading figure on the screen. That was a worthy warm up if I do say so myself.\n\n\r\nOverall (8.6/10):\r\nThis was a short one, but a memorable one as it is.

            "content": "\n                We can at least agree that the age of the so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d is way past us at this point, One Piece is still going on just as fantastic and strong, but the other two have long been in the afterlife. For a while now, countless fresh new shounen shows were striving to replace the old highly praised shows as the leading next-generation version (or just what Naruto tries to called its sequel; Boruto).\r\nIt's undeniable at this point that the Boku no Hero Academia is at the pinnacle of its growth, with two successful seasons, popular Manga, new upcoming games, feature movies, and I cankeep on going for long, this show is definitely a highlight for the new generation of anime. Boku no Hero Academia 3rd Season continue the trend of its two previous seasons on being a seasonal show that doesn't fall short on delivering quality entertainment in all sorts of aspects, much like what Shingeki no Kyojin got us used to, crisp animation and phenomenal audio work were always a nice guy with open welcoming hands, doing a shounen feature justice for once.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nAnother season, another adventure. There is a lot to go through here, but let's just say, this season, in particular, was the most diverse in terms of story arcs, we get a field trip, an exam, an epic duel and more, what else could you ask for? This season managed to cover up the change of story in a great way, and yes, there was a great change in that respect, past this season, the world of Boku no Hero Academia is never the same, having villains cause much more pressure than before forced heroes all over the world to put into consideration plans they never accounted for. The heroes in training never thought the world could be this cruel.\r\nOne major flaw that bothered me was how linear and simplistic this season was, not entirely true for all arcs, but I could call on at least one that suffered the most from so much happening at the same time that it becomes a complete shitfest of an uninteresting mess.\r\nSeason two's tournament arc was spectacular, it made you appreciate how well and constructed the flow of events are in the story, but the tournament arc of this season was in compared to the previous one, very poorly written, it was all rushed and lazy that it felt like a filler arc.\n\r\n- Art (8.7/10):\r\nUnlike any other show, Boku no Hero Academia has a different feel to its animation, it's pretty average on parts that don't require any heavy animation works, like dialogue centered moments, flashbacks... But the battles, the battle speak for an entirely different manner. There is something to it, something that makes your muscles respond to whatever is being shown, Midoriya could be throwing one of his epic punches, and all your muscles would be mimicking it unintentionally, it all sounds very dynamic and bound to the limitless freedom of camera movements with the odd 3D-like angles.\r\nI kid you not when I say that a simple animation can put so much weight and emotions on each frame even if it was the most ordinary thing in combat, like a single punch, all it requires is moving a hand from point A to point B, and yet, Boku no Hero Academia pulls it off with the use of some unknown black magic that it smashes every bit of doubt and uncertainty.\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\r\nThere hasn't been a single opening theme song that isn't included in the infamous \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d playlist on youtube, they are everywhere.\r\nBoku no Hero Academia 3rd Season makes a return with its amazing opening theme song picks, a couple of them this time around as well that remained as faithful to the quality we're used to.\r\nIf I had to choose, I'd say that this season was the greatest in terms of voice acting and soundtrack blending. One of the most emotional and epically intense moments of the series happens to take place here, and if the animation doesn't do the trick for you, the music, voice acting and everything related to audio can alone give you an experience out of this world that even a blind person would appreciate.\n\r\n- Character (8.5/10):\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is house of a ridiculously huge character cast looking at the length of the series (as far as basic seasonal shows go), but, the good thing here is they are handled in an efficient way that gives to everyone a considerable amount of focus and care. Midoriya and Bakugo's relationship goes through a drastic phase, it was anticipated for the longest time now, but the way it all turned up to be was what made it special, we're ages passed the emo days of the likes of Sasuke Uchiha, this series that made everyone doubt it at the end, going as far as calling it a ripoff of other big shows is finally having it's glorious 180 turns on those people.\r\nA lot of new side characters make their debuts as well with well-established backstories and roles, talking here about both supporting characters and villains.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.0/10):\r\nNow, I enjoy my Boku no Hero Academia, and I always have, and I'd calmly even say that this was the season that made the series closer to me, undoubtedly my favorite season as for now.\r\nA lot of turnarounds happened, but they were all for a good reason, and only made the show better. I'm still having problems with the exam arc though.\n\r\n- Overall (8.2/10):\r\nAlready a fan of the previous two seasons? Why not hop in right away then? I can at least assurte you that action-wise, this show cuts the cake easily over the previous ones. It's way more serious, emotional, and developed, and on a bigger budget as well. Just like always, mildly family friendly with some few fan service, of course, there's also mild nudity towards the end, a character that makes his debuts seem to have problems keeping on his when fighting, so you'll have to see some butt on this one.\n"

A huge reason for this is how this part lacked a lot of build-ups that depended on the previous part while the latter lacked any sort of sensible resolution.\n\r\nMultiple characters had a resolution to their personal inner conflicts, it brought about peace and tranquility and help clear up the fuzzy image that the series hadsince it started, now, the finish line is clearer, and the goal is undistracted and ready for more exposition.\n\r\nWhat really made this part stand out, even more than season one, is how all beneficial were side/supporting characters that achieved development to the highest degrees, while Subaru stood on the sideline and kept watch, not to say he did not develop himself, but compared to how much he was able to upgrade his flaws by an amount of time, this time, it was overshadowed by how great everyone else shined.\n\r\nReally, I can't stress enough how great of a care everyone got, fan favorites, underrated characters, it didn't matter how important they were, they are now a better version of themselves.\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10\n"

As a long-time fan of the original Trigun series, I approached this remake with skepticism. But to my pleasant surprise, it exceeded my expectations and left me with a nostalgic feeling that I haven't felt in a long time.\n\r\nThe show starts with Meryl Stryfe and Roberto De Niro, two reporters on the hunt for Vash, a notorious outlaw. What they find instead is a man who couldn't be more different from the one they were expecting. Vash is peaceful and beloved by the residents ofthe town he resides in. His reputation as a violent terrorist is actually the result of his evil twin brother's actions. Vash's past and his brother's looming presence set the stage for an action-packed and thrilling adventure.\n\r\nThe use of CGI animation in Trigun Stampede might make some viewers wary, but the series completely shattered my doubts. The 3D animation was beautifully done and conveyed the story with a cinematic flair that I've never seen before. It was artistic, polished, and fit the futuristic world of Trigun perfectly.\n\r\nThe remake is a solid reimagining of the original series, with new characters that fit in perfectly with the old ones. Roberto, in particular, was a standout character for me. His enthusiasm and loyalty to Vash were infectious, and I found myself rooting for him throughout the show.\n\r\nBut it's the OG cameos that really hit home for me. Seeing characters like Wolfwood and Milly again after so many years was a nostalgic and heartwarming experience. The show also did a fantastic job of incorporating familiar themes from the original series, such as Vash's quest for peace and the idea that there's always hope, even in the darkest of times.\n\r\nOverall, Trigun Stampede was a fantastic anime that exceeded my expectations. It was a nostalgic journey that reminded me why I fell in love with the original Trigun series in the first place. The stunning visuals, excellent storyline, and memorable characters make it a must-watch for any fan of the franchise.\n\r\nOverall: 8.62/10.\n"

This new movie has a destructive cult following, so much so that people bash on his previous works and praise this one just because the former has gotten its root deeply into the mainstream.\n\r\nAside from cameos of characters from past Shinkai films, the main cast had an impression that was there to stay, no matter how badwe bash them now, I'm sure seeing them in future works would feel just as nostalgic and hitting as the former.\r\nThe starring roles went to fairly young kids but still retained a special touch of realism for the adult audience to relate to, and if not, the movie was generous enough to highlight some of the side characters and giving them a perspective that enabled them to impact the cursor of the story as well.\n\r\nThe movie is yet again a marveling proof of Shinkai's artistic direction, but even more than that, the feature musical score felt like an experience in and of itself. Add to that the world-class acting performance that does shy from invoking heartfelt emotions by the simplest voice crack or tone shift.\n\r\nI'm not sure about the \u201cShinkai's best\u201d statement regarding this movie, but it solidified itself as one of his best achievements no doubt, a feat that he keeps enforcing time and time again.\n\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nArt (9.9/10)\r\nSound (9/10)\r\nCharacters (8.5/10)\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\r\nOverall (8.88/10)\n"

See, 3 ba movies in succession kind lead you down the way, pre-writing a template for your fourth and last review of this movie collection in a devastating tone of betrayal, just showing how much of a let down it was for me till this point, but this movie kinda slaps. Although, not as hard as I would have liked.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nSome would argue that Bleach isn't your mindblowing literature epic as it tends to priorities the battler aspect of what makes a Shounen good and disregards everything else that wouldmake it excellent. The past three movies failed miserably at maintaining the least amount of mediocre screening that the faith for this last movie was already clear and set, but reality was none of that.\r\nHell Verse goes back to the origins of Bleach, whereas the previous movies focused on Ichigo protecting random people and close friends, this one hit back right at the OG spot, where Ichigo is cornered into protecting his sisters who have been entangled into some hellish scheme that would mater make more sense.\n\r\nArt (9/10):\r\nIt's apparent that every movie up until this one has had a noticeable visual upgrade that reminds you it's a movie production, but this one was just exponential.\r\nThe design and aesthetic that went with the hell verse was just astonishing, great location with a creative direction and atmosphere, the lighting varies from one level to the other, it felt different and fresh.\r\nThe fights were breathtakingly choreographed, nicely paced, and steadily scaled.\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nRevolting against Bleach's audible accomplishments is a crime at this point, if the show were to be nominated for anything, this is where it consistently shined.\r\nThe OST composition in this number was just insane, new remixes and subtle transitions between different tracks were just, wow.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nUnfortunately, the new cast which composes the villainous side was yet another en of the week baddy that didn't know their place. They brought nothing new or memorable to the table and the constant \u201cThat's impossible\u201d spam definitely was of no help.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nThis was by far my favorite Bleach movie, the only worthy movie of a rewatch in my eyes, it's easy to follow, features hype fights, and weirdly nostalgic for some reason.\n\r\nOverall (7.8/10):\r\nFor me, this is movie is to Bleach what Naruto Shippuden movie 3 was to Naruto Shippuden, you can easily recommend this to friends who aren't Bleach fans and they might still enjoy it as it offers a portion of what Bleach really is without spoiling any major plot threads.\n"

Again, perfect pacing, no wasted time on reaction shots, and showing the same plan cup of tea from different angles over boring dialog. The openings and endings maintained the same force and vibe which is just fine and the animation, contrary to popular belief, surpassed what even the first cour had going for it.  The \"Bread scene\" is a prime example of this.\n\r\nThis season really was what I wanted the first courto be, it had everything matched up. But maybe it is because the first cour had a steady and consistent build-up to the climaxes this cour had. The characters are much well grounded, they are better developed, their bonds are more interesting and their motivations are clearer.\n\r\nThe world-building in this cour is also top-notch. The Demon continent is a vast and mysterious place, filled with all sorts of dangers and secrets. The way the story slowly unfolds and reveals more and more about this world is masterfully done, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The fact that the story takes place in a demon world also adds a whole new layer of depth and intrigue to the narrative.\n\r\nThe characters in this cour are also a huge step up from the first cour. The dynamic between Rudeus, Eris, and Ruijerd is just amazing. They all have their own unique personalities and motivations, and their interactions with each other are just so fun and engaging to watch. Eris especially stood out to me, her character arc is just so compelling and it's amazing to see her grow and develop over the course of the cour.\n\r\nThe culmination of these two courses really makes it so hard to go back to the old mediocre copy-paste Isekai shows that seem to rain down in the masses every season. We are witnessing the making of something special here and it's about time some change was introduced to the medium.\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10.\n"

            "content": "\n                The detective mystery solving genre was always popular, so captivating and involving, ever since the masterpiece of the 66 detective novels by Agatha Christie. Japan too had adapted this storytelling concept and produced some of the finest detective stories as well in form of Manga and Anime alike, for instance, Detective Conan. Gosick is by no mean a first and above all others, but it had a unique take on the genre by being heavily influenced by supernaturalism in a desperate attempt to come up with something original and complex enough to let you \u201cwow\u201d after a case has been solved, but the thing is,it works, however, it also comes at a dear price.\n\r\n- Story (8/10):\r\nKazuya Kujou, an oriental exchange student comes to Sauville, a fictional country in Europe in order to follow up his studies. Turns out he found himself in a completely new world, a world very different than where he comes from by more than the color of hair and eyes, a country very reliant and famous for its fables and mysterious tragedies, among them, the golden fairy that resides at the top of a tower. Enter Victorique, a short loli looking doll-faced sweet lover, a first-degree expert at bad mouthing other people. Have it be a murder, impersonation or a hoax, the duo strives to solve the mystery around every famous case by the request of the local investigation bureau. But the show is more than a sequence of cases that needs to be solved, but down the line, all of those cases become to be unraveled as only preparations leading to an even greater case of murder that could shake the whole country, and as consequence, the stability of the great powers in Europe.\r\nI personally find most of the riddles very interesting, and another case relates to a prior one was just too satisfying to realize. I also appreciate the minimalistic amount of flashbacks, as the ones we've got were more than enough to keep the pace up of what's currently happening.\r\nHowever, there was still something up there that didn't feel quite right. Because of the linear nature of the storytelling, sometimes the mystery being solved is either predictable, too obvious, or just interesting to follow up.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nLet's talk about the producing studio for starters. Studio bones, if that doesn't ring any bell, it's the same studio that did Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Noragami, Mob Psycho 100, Boku no Hero Academia...\r\nJust so you know what you're getting because if that wasn't enough already, I can assure you, the quality of the animation remained consistent throughout the whole series and managed to keep up the quality up to today's standards. The fighting scenes? there isn't a lot, but the one we've got was enough to make your eye capture as much of that sweetness as a Sharingan can.\r\nAs a generalization, the art style feels very average and a bit cartoonish, something between Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Little Witch Academia. Which in my opinion was great to capture the atmosphere of the portrayed era, between the two world wars, a time of the great shift from the occult to science.\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\r\nAoi Yuuki (Tsuyu from My Hero Academia, Tatsumaki from One Punch Man) and Takuya Eguchi (Shinji from Koruko no Basket, Nero from 91 Days), need I say more? There may not be the biggest voice actors out there, but if you know those characters, you know how amazing their acting blends with a role. People would point their fingers at Kujou saying he's annoying, talks too much, but that was the point, he's a naive 15 years old dude in a foreign land, he questions anything new he sees and quibbles with how different things are dealt with there. And then comes Victorique with a delicate tone of voice, as golden as her hair and as fragile as her physic, you just can't deny the cuteness sometimes. I'm serious when I say, they must really love what they were doing, the effort is obviously noticeable in their performance, like when Victorique cries, it gives you chills down your spine as if somebody was genuinely crying.\n\r\n- Character (7.0/10):\r\nAside from Victorique, there wasn't any figure on two legs that stood out much, Victorique was more than a main piece in the show, she was the center of her universe, but her beauty and brain, everybody else paled in comparison, but that doesn't mean they acted like soulless Americans, most of them were interesting in their own, like Brain, and Cordelia, Albert and so on. Victorique has had a great character development, she went from the shy unsocial unfriendly fairy to a very appreciative person, but not much can be said about Kujou, he kept a steady nagging through the run screaming \u201cVictorique\u201d at least 20 times each episode.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nDetective stories are not precisely my cup of tea, but having a loli take charge of things is another thing. [title] gave me more than mystery solving pleasure, I had my share of shipping and comedy as well, for that, I'm very welcoming.\n\r\n- Overall (8.0/10):\r\nNow, this is definitely something I'd recommend, even for people that aren't into the detective genre for how much diversity it can develop. As long as you can remain focused and keep up with the mind trickery that is, the show will be worth it.\n"

I sure took a time, but I never tried to spoil anything during that time, and so Tokyo Ghoul:re was released...\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re follow Ken Kaneki after the events of the second season, I don't intend to spoil any plot points in this review, but let's say, things changed, and the world is a lot more gruesome and challenging too, old enemies attained to their injuries and are back, and also are the Ken's friends.\r\nAs somebody that never read the Manga, I really believe that this season was created with the idea in mind that everyone watching it would have already read the Manga, and thus will be able to keep up with the very fast-paced nature of the storytelling on this season, It really was a challenge to me to make up sense of what's happening most of the time, a lot of foreshadowing was present, a lot of dialog and action, but to mee, it still felt way too fast for me to be on the same page as the events were occurring.\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\r\nBeautiful, almost tastable eye candy on your screen, this one would go up into my compilation of amazing art, and hold a solid spot somewhere on the top. the Tokyo Ghoul series has always had some great art and animation, but this season took it all to a whole next level with its breathtaking details and fluid animation, it was almost distracting from the yet complex and fast plot points.\r\nI can at least appreciate the gore in this one, I like how they are not afraid to censor anything, but giving us all of the gruesomeness we deserve.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nI'd say, the sound production was at its most average form, the voice actors did their best, but it still didn't connect to me at the end, I didn't really like the opening song, but the end was great.\r\nAgain, the voice acting really was just as messy as the fast paced action, I could have sworn that if I had read the Manga first and then watched the season I would hvae grasped what's happening a lot better.\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\r\nOk, this is where I drew the line, I was okay with the character roster of the earlier seasons, but this was just too much, not that the new characters were bad or anything, but it was just too much, way too overkill for a short season as far as 12 episodes go, I had just taken a long enough break from Tokyo Ghoul to be greeted with loads and loads of new characters, it was a real challenge remembering their names, or even on which side they are, looking how most of them where similarily looking to one another.\r\nI would have loved if it had a smaller character roster because, for newcomers who never read the Manga, it feels more like a chore to keep up than actual entertainment.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\r\nI really was disappointed after finishing this season, I never felt hyped up at the part that I was supposed to, I never cried or felt sad or even connected with any of the characters, I was just sitting in front of a screen trying to understand what's going on most of the time, not really hating it, but not praising it either. I would probably do better with a rewatch, but that's something for another day.\n\r\n- Overall (7.2/10):\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re was a let down for me, I would suggest that you rewatch the two first seasons if it's been a while since you last saw them, because trust me, you will need to know all the prior information you can grasp at once, if you already read the Manga, I believe you'll find this one entertaining than I did, seeing those cool panel moments animated will definitely pay off with this new smooth animation, good luck.\n"

With a limited edition tenth manga volume, fans of the series were in for a treat. The OVA focuses on the backstory of the infamous Satou, and how he discovered that he was an Ajin.\n\r\nFrom the first scene, you can see that Satou has always been a bit of a loose cannon. He captured the first-ever Ajin in Africa and was set on his path of destruction. The lengths that he went through just to have some fun are a little unsettling, but it's what makeshim such a captivating character.\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the episode was the scene when Satou realized that he was an Ajin. The evil laugh that he let out was a bit over the top, but it was still a great moment. The final line was also pretty badass.\n\r\nSatou is a comical by-the-book villain and a great one at that. He is a bona fide psycho and he only did that U-turn because he was bored and wanted some excitement. He isn't apologetic about his actions and he never begs for compassion from the viewer. The scene where he had a rocket launcher indoors is proof that he's a high-level antagonist.\n\r\nFans of Ajin are in for a treat with this OVA. It's an amazing look into the character of Satou and how he became the madman we all know and love. The idea that you won't know if you're an Ajin or not until you die is a little humorous, as it means that Ajin could be anywhere as long as people haven't killed themselves.\n\r\nIn conclusion, this OVA is a great addition to the Ajin franchise and is highly recommended for fans of the series. Whether you're a fan of Satou or not, you won't be disappointed by the backstory that this OVA provides.\n"

I had no attachment to the game franchise nor have I even heard of anything related to it before then, but the description seemed like any trash Isekai that I can shut my brain off and still enjoy, but it turned out that even trash has tiers and unfortunately, Ni no Kuno fails to stand out even among the lowest of the low.\n\r\nStory (6.5/10):\r\nI wish I canskip this portion entirely, we all know, it's not Ni no Kuni's fault, but the entire Isekai shitfest is practically the same, only with different names and powers.\r\nThis story starts like every other, two friends travel between two worlds in order to keep their other friend alive, simple enough, but the complications really add a bit of sugar to this dull piece of work.\r\nThe plot, however, feels a little more quirky and interesting when the threads are laid out, how the two main characters are related, and how their actions in either world affect the other. But it still was not enough to save it from its clich\u00e9 infested progression that had me fall asleep mid of the movie.\n\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI don't know whether I should be proud of the recent seasonal shows or disappointed in this movie, cause I'm trying so hard to note a moment that showed the slightest marvel animation but I can not. It was averagely animated, easily looks like any typical modern show which by the way is great in their own way, but for a movie? That was very underwhelming. The character designs look nothing interesting, very generic looking, and can be swapped by any background filler character without anyone noticing, not even themselves. Yuu, however, looks like your classic Ghibli prince and that's it. There was also a use of horrible CGI at times, but not too much that it completely ruined the experience.\n\r\nSound (7/10):\r\nNothing to complain about here, but also nothing to admire. Following the same steps of the story, it was not memorable in the least, the voice acting I thought was decent, the musical scores were fine but too special that sticks to memory.\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\r\nAgain, walking out reeking of disappointment, the story starts out very solid for an Isekai looking at the characters and their motives, however, shortly after everyone just stops trying. Yuu is a very boring Mary-Sue type of character that feels like he's reciting a 1000 pages inspirational quotes repository, and Haru is a jealous end that tries to create drama and lengthen the story for the sake of it being long enough to be featured as a movie. Character development is very minimal, almost non-existent, and includes only Haru, as for everyone else, I've seen more interesting wooden planks in my backyards.\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nI can't describe this being anything more than average, so much so that I'm starting my own average Isekai metric system in which Ni no Kuni is the core of the measure. The premise is very interesting and holds a lot of potentials that it left me kinda lost in thought thinking of how the movie could have been if they did not screw everything up.\n\r\nOverall (6.9):\r\nNo matter how average this movie was, and no matter how little I consider rewatching it any time soon or ever, I would probably jump back on it with a group of friends for how easy and simple to get into it and still grasp everything happening despite talking over every scene and fool around instead of focusing all of your attention on it. Other than that, if you're coming from the game franchise, that could be an entire another discussion that I'm not able to project.\n"
