I thought both shows were in the same vein, turned out I was wrong.\n\r\nKengan Ashura approaches the world of underground fights in a very different manner and hearing people comparing the two shows at this point does nothing but cringe my brains out my nostrils, very graphic yes, but not as surprisingly graphic as Kengan Ashura was.\n\r\nWe first get introduced to Ohma, a very silent and unfriendly dude, fueled with excitement over every opportunity to throw hands he gets, as we get more familiar with his strange attitude, we slowly unravel more abouthis past, un-cohesive fragments that let us peek closely at what sort of man he really is. On the other side of the coin, there is Yamashita Kazou, an old Japanese salaryman, so fed up with his life, the non-ending bills and debt is catching up to his last nerves, with no way out, he gets involved in this gruesome underworld fighting scene with a promise for a better and more stable life.\n\r\nWhat really put Kengan Ashura above Baki narratively was the plot itself, there is a lot of politics to what seems like just a sublime fist fight. Global corporations are at stake and influence is constantly shaping up to be the decider of fates here. It throws itself under a curve ball but comes off as a full-powered continental crossing canon shot, full of promise and rights to come.\n\r\nLooking at this first season alone, not much can be praised, but it's one of that stories that lays itself a strong foundation and builds upon it in time. So many intriguing characters make their debut and a lot of rivalries are set up from the get-go.\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10.\n"
