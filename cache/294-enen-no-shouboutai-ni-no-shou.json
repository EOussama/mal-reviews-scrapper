David Studio really is throwing some enormous budget on this show. There were more highly animated scenes than not, some of which rival modern movies in quality. The expressions have never been this lively, the colors look more vibrant and alive and the fire animation, in the words of lady Agness, got more firey if you will.\n\r\nSound (8/10):\r\nThe voice acting was very good this season. Especially Tamaki's, Shinra, and dear God, Dr. Geovanni.\r\nThe production team nailed sound design in season one and they never showed any signs of slacking off this season too. The SFX are very fitting, intense, and highlight every moment of impact and combustion, at this point, I wish lighting up a tighter would sound as badass as fire sounds in the show.\r\nThe openings were great, especially the first one, and vice versa for the endings. Seriously, the second ending song rivals season one's first ending theme song.\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\r\nThere were undeniably more character moments this season.\r\nMore of my complaints of which regard completely turned to compliments as I 100% started watching this season with 0 expectations for seeing any improvements in what concerns character development and such.\r\nTamaki was amazing this season, her growth really highlighted her journey thus far, no more complaints about her, I mean, her random fan service moments are still just as strong but they seem to have gotten a better grab for better timing and execution.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.4/10):\r\nI would be lying if I said I did not like this season better than I did the previous one, it's an objectively better production, better storyboarded and directed, the humor seemed to have improved and the backstories really did not take from the actions and were properly placed and called for at the right moment. Unlike season one, it definitely makes you wish for a third season.\n\r\nOverall (8.06/10):\r\nThis is how a sequel should improve.\r\nEnen no Shoboutai shows a lot more potential in this one, not that it didn't in the first season, it definitely had something but it lost it somewhere mid-season, however, with this crazy comeback of a sequel, it restored and even built more on top of what it originally presented, expanding on the lore, normalizing and improving the main cast's treats and overall improving accordingly in every way.\n"
