In Ansatsu Kyoshitsu's case, that was exactly it, what you read in the title is what you get. A bittersweet heartwarming refresher that really takes you back. Removing all the meaty mush and exposing you to the highlights of the show, lighting up the part of the story you thought you still remember but have since forgotten about, it almost made it feel like a brand new experience, and in my case, it was far from it.\n\r\nI really like the fact that they actually put in somework into putting together this recap movie, an hour and a half of pure nostalgic gags and tears, I would say that a solid 85% of the movie was composed of reused shots from the two seasons of the franchise, with the rest being new animated scenes between Nagisa and Karma meeting up again at their old school to honor the memory of their late teacher, no our late teacher, Koro-sensei. As they exchanged greetings, they immediately lost track of time as they started retelling what probably was their best and worse year in retrospect.\n\r\nAs a recap, it was, good, I would say that some scenes would have relatively been better if re-adapted, but it was an enjoyable watch empty of grind or boredom of any sort. Or at least, it was for me.\n"
