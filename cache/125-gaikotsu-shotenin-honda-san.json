When you first look at it, there is the cover art, then the synopsis, and the genre, three of the arbitrary deciding factors that might give you a primary opinion on a said show, and for me, it was one boney boy and no idea on the plot whatsoever, and probably that's what appealing about the Slice of Life genre, you know it's following someone's daily life, you know it's going to be either hilariously on point or sadly relatable, probably both.\r\nAfter watching Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san, I might just add an exceptionto that factor.\n\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nWhen it comes to its fundamental core, it's just another Slice of Life show, the kind of shows that are worth the watch after a long tire-y day of work, and probably that's what justifies its relatively short episodes (about 10 minutes each). Not only does it blend well with the relaxation after a hard day scenario, but the show itself also dives into the idea of hard working and doing the best in your job, for your job.\r\nThe setup is pretty simple and familiar, one busy bookstore, specialized in selling Manga and Light novels, I guess similar merchandise as well?\r\nHonda-san is one skull-faced ambitious clerk that strives to genuinely provide the most ideal customer service with the help of his equally enthusiastic co-workers. No literally, the part about the skull face couldn't be more literal. Filled with other famous Manga and Anime references and with a tremendous amount of fourth-wall breaking jokes, it really made for the perfect parody of the Otaku community, something that think is semi-important to get most of the jokes.\n\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nNot too shabby, and not with the rest of average works either.\r\nAs serious as the show is, the animation, in my opinion, couldn't be any more complimentary. There is something about it, very clean and abstract that makes it stand out for the other shows, it really does have that special charm of its own that makes it distinguishable in a great way.\r\nAnd don't mix it up, when I talk animation, I talk art style, because you know, for a series that doesn't rely on action and fast-paced scenes, smooth animation wouldn't do it any favor.\r\nThe character designs are truly remarkable, for instance, the main cast is put in such a noticeable perspective you'd almost see a spotlight on top of them all the time. Obviously, the show makes references to the real world, it presents the character as normal everyday life people; with no superpowers or out of the world capabilities but a blessing that gives you a genuine smile, which is more of a naturable rare ability,n especially in this day and age.\r\nA skeleton as a clerk and his gang of weirdly masked people, at first they give you the impression of goofiness, but they, those are the manifestation of their personalities, also that outlining look only helps to highlight them from the rest of the crowd on the screen. Most of the shows could settle by giving the main character an explicit hairstyle or a special hair color, but Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san goes all out and parodies even those who fall short on delivery.\n\r\nSound (7.5/10):\r\nA big part of this was the voice acting, and you know, in a comedy show, a special kind of voice acting is needed, something that's really hard to nail.\r\nI wouldn't have recommended a better mashup of good voice actors that can blend this well in a show of this production value.\r\nI feel as though I should talk in a more general way when it comes to this part, but I can't help but direct all my focus on Honda-san (Saitou Souma).\r\nHe's presented with such tone of voice that alone screams of comedy, all of the nervous cuts and Engrish overdosing was worth it on the run.\r\nI can't really speak much of the opening and ending theme songs, I know I enjoyed the opening theme song to some degree, however, I never got the single from the latter. As for the soundtracks, I don't think I've been able to notice them all that much, probably because of how involving the content was to me, you just keep on focusing on the context you almost get drawn onto to screen and blend with the rest of the characters for how painfully relatable it was.\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\r\nI've been eager to talk about the characters ever since the first episode.\r\nI've said a lot in the \u201cArt\u201d section already, but I feel that was only what concerned the character design. And now, let's hit their terminology.\r\nHonda-san, an individual that's been presented to us as the typical bookstore clerk we all know, the dead in the face stereotype that really seems all that boring on the surface, probably that's what they were aiming for with his skeletal design. But once we get put in the clerks' perspective, we get to see more on how \u201cthey\u201d view the business, what goes in their minds when they are serving a customer, are they genuinely doing it for the good, or just as a means of survival?\r\nIt turns out some people are just born that nice, but can't express it correctly, probably that's what stops a lot of relationships. You never have to judge people by appearances, one thug looking fella might become your closest friend open the expense of a \u201cGood morning\u201d, you might never know. And that doesn't concern only Honda-san, it seems all of his co-workers relate to the same treats one way or another, they all have to deal with different costumes every day, and we know, people come in all different types.\r\n\u201csticks and stones may break my bones but a difficult costumer might draw me into depression, and a cheerful might even cure my cancer\u201d, that's what it was like for the cast all along.\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\r\nAnd even beyond. 8 out of 10 sounds like a disappointment for a show of this status, I forgot how long was it since I last enjoyed a comedy slice of life before deciding it's one shallow try-hard series. For me, Gaikotsu Shotenin Honda-san was a bit too fast-paced, you have characters talking way too fast I found myself replaying some bits more occasionally so that I could get the meaning behind the references they were making, one could say it's part of the experience, however, I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't had to tone down to that. I'm willing to give it another rewatch and pick up on the jokes I've missed out on, and would even consider rewatching it dubbed if we ever got a decent one soon.\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10):\r\nEverything must come to an end, at least, I can say I've watched a great series from the bottom of my heart, as much as unbiased I tried to make this review, I was hesitant to submit to this somewhat low score for such a charming series, I know for a fact this is going on the top of my list of comedy slice if life recommendations. Not only that but as strong as it stands out as a rewatch heavy material, this should become more familiar as I'm willing to rewatch the heck out of it with friends and family, all of the BL jokes can never get old.\r\nI do think however that most of the enjoyment comes at the expense of being familiar with the Otaku community, or else, most of the jokes would only get passed the typical viewer without a sent.\n"
