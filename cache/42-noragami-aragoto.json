Something you don't always get from sequels, in most cases your nostalgia would lead you to believe that the first season will always be superior no matter what, but no with this. there is an undeniable quality raise in this season, and that's apparent from the get-go.\r\nNoragami Aragoto was an improvement on top of the first season, Noragami, while the art style maintained its memorable quality, and the soundtracks too, the plot has seen some really exciting rollercoaster action, talking the IT languages, let's encrypt...\n\r\n- Story (9.2/10):\r\nThe first season was where it all started, but despite the massive information we gotout of it, we were still left with so many unanswered questions to fill up a library.\r\nNoragami Aragoto focuses on the origin of our protagonist Yato, where he originated from, and what made him the person he is now, what happened between him and Veen. It even dives deeper to explain some of the obscure stuff about the Nora that keeps appearing in front of him with no prior warning.\r\nTo say the least, the story progressing in this season was far superior to the first's, whereas Noragami did deliver some really solid plot points, this is where the real hype resides, I mean every episode was filled with stuff interesting enough to shake the whole comment section.\n\r\n- Art (8.5/10):\r\nI can't really complain, or else I would deserve to be smacked on the face, other shows would kill for this kind of care when it comes to animation.\r\nI don't think it's any friction far superior to the first season's, but the quality remains and shines even more in fight scenes.\r\nEverything from the opening and ending themes visuals, to the stunning fluid animation, to the stillest shots there are, nothing feels unfitting or unpleasant to look at, you're just being gift a great animation that keeps up the pace, and lets you focus on what's happening, not bad to let you disappointed, and not too outstanding to distract you either.\n\r\n- Sound (9.0/10):\r\nI misjudged the first season's soundtrack before and given it a lower score than this one, how rushful was I, I only got to notice to moving, how involved it was in this season, seeing how they kept the old OST.\r\nOne of the things I was upset about when finishing the first season, was missing the opening, that was was spectacular, I dove in with zero expectation for this season's opening theme song, but was greeted with an even better one, oh, how many times I screamed along the lyrics at the beginning of each episode, it was just phenomenal. This should make me lose some points at those \u201cTry not to sign\u201d challenges.\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\r\nWhile keeping the old cast of characters, but with extras, being that they are no longer too annoying like Hiyori and Yukine were to some people, they really grew more mature and understanding, in a good way of course. Veena was really given a huge attention here, explaining her treats, dissecting her attitude and all, along with her servants.\r\nA lot of other new characters were introduced too, that remained appealing from the moment of their introduction. more people to love other than Yato,\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.1/10):\r\nI can definitely confirm that I did enjoy this season more than the first one, and I really dug the first one. unlike the first, every episode had many things to hook you on, I love the cliffhangers, and even more so the fast-paced storytelling, really makes you beg for a third season.\n\r\n- Overall (9.0/10):\r\nIf the first season would have left me hesitant from recommending it to my fellow friends, this season alone makes me want to shove the franchise up their faces. Yes, I would say, this is a must watch for modern Anime series, because honestly, it's rare to find some really good shows these days.\n"
