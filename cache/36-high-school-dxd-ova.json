Ok, with that out of the way, this is an OVA, a short that expands on the original series, be it on the story, or character development, but seeing that the parent story had almost none of those, this is an expansionof its glorious side, that resides on the hardcore fanservice.\n\r\n- Story (4.0/10):\r\nThis OVA, that's told in 2 episodes are a very standalone tails that require no knowledge on the parent show, so even if you have not watched the show, you can probably still watching and enjoy this, it has no attachment to the plot whatsoever, and it's not a bad thing, these two episodes each tell a different story, so the production team must have to improvise a lot, and eventually came with the most stereotypical shounen episodes ever, Nothing to be memorable here really, aside from the yet extreme fanservice.\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\r\nJust as good as the main show, with the decent art style, and ideal female anatomy, the ridiculous breast physics are just as wild as ever, and the camera angles, \ud83d\udc4c.\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\r\nIf it weren't for the shortness of this animation, the amazing soundtrack would have had some space to breathe, I'm deeply in love with the parent series' OST, too bad it wasn't used more often in here.\r\nThe sound effects used here are surprisingly good, especially the ones simulating sexual contact.\r\nThe voice acting was at it's best as well.\n\r\n- Character (4.0/10):\r\nJust as poor and flawed as the main story, it seems the production team didn't expand on the characters more, as they remain just as one dimensional as ever, most of them are just pure sexual reincarnation that has nothing to admire aside from their body bumps.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.5/10):\r\nI really enjoyed watching this despite its many flaws, it's like they understood what we really want from series such as these, nobody cares about the plot, or else we would have gone to better story driven shows, they just gave us our overdose of fanservice, with extra comedy.\n\r\n- Overall (6.3/10):\r\nThis is originally a sequel to the first season and a prequel to the second, and as one might see them, they are respectively the 13th and 14th episodes from the 1st season, but watching them isn't necessary to grasp the \u201cplot\u201d, if you have time to spare and see some extra goofiness and extreme fanservice, then tag along.\n"
