    "content": "\n                Akane, that unpredictable inspector back at it again, and more badass than ever, things are different now, new faces arrived, but the monster within still sleeping as deeply as it has throughout the whole first season, but it's time for it to go leach into the world and break havoc, would she withstand this new challenge? well, you tell me...\n\r\n- Story(7.5/10):\r\nThe story starts in the near future after the events of the first season, while somewhat based on the latter's plot, it relies on an almost different cast, circulating around Akane of course, and so other familiar faces.\r\nThe threats are as strong as ever, ifnot more, the Sibyl system is more cornered that it ever was, lots of revolts and twist go along the way, will Akane keep up her hue unclouded? probably, you can only know if you watched the series ;)\r\nThe plot in this really tends to expand on the world and explain a lot of stuff we questioned in the first season, it also drives deep into the roots and foundations of the Sibyl system to make it clear to compare what has the Sibyl system come to, and where it began, the rigged nature only came later and turned it up the way it is now.\n\r\n- Art(8.5/10):\r\nRemember those crispy visuals? exactly, crazily reflect the nature of this show, the facial expressions are just so beautiful as they help the characters display a more emotional state second only to the voice acting, but have I told you how unattractive some of the CG scenes look? horrifying if that's a way to put it.\n\r\n- Sound(8/10):\r\nAt first, I really looked down on this season's opening and ending sequences, but God does the production tea know its stuff, very classy music that sticks to the head easily, the suspect sound effects included.\r\nThe voice acting was great as always, with my personal English voice actor, \u201cChristopher Sabat\u201d in the party, (binge-watch goals).\n\r\n- Character(7/10):\r\nUnlike the first season, this one falls greatly in comparison, most of the characters are just dull, and their screentime doesn't help either, aside from few of our familiar faces, nobody really sets a remarkable act, including Akane herself, but the real disaster is the inspector \u201cMika\u201d, ugh, so happy I would probably never hear from her again. the thing is, Kougami and especially Makishima set a really high ceiling on the first season, so it's the only natural for anybody else to fail at topping that.\n\r\n- Enjoyment(7.5/10):\r\nI did enjoy the watch, the twist was as crazy and messed up as ever, but I know for a fact that season 1 was hell a lot of a roller coaster, there were a lot of problems with this season, but it remains a decent sequel at least.\n\r\n- Overall(7.7/10):\r\nAhh, how glad am I to live in a world that's nothing like this show, and what I'm more glad of, is I can finally convince somebody else to watch this great series, so that I can enjoy their reactions and point of views, totally a show to specify time for, grab some popcorn, get comfy and start a horrifying binge-watch, (no kids allowed).\n"
