    "content": "\n                There is something about the OLD One Piece that feels so; HOME. So welcoming yet strange to the heart, it has a unique feel that is rarely replicated, even by the same series 20 years later, the risks are lower, but still life-threatening to the crew back then, the world feels so much smaller yet very promising to explorers like the Straw Hats. And the adventures, as small as they may be, are always inviting and friendly to the third party that is the audience.\n\r\nThe story at hand takes place somewhere between Logue town and the entrance to the Grand Line, possibly before the WarshipIsland. The crew has not seen what the Grand Line has in store, so meeting up with these colossal sea monsters must have been a shocking nightmare to some, and a challenging foe to others. With the crew being still at its earliest, only the first five members present, they blend rather well into the story, probably aside from Sanji would probably have less screen time than some of the side-characters.\n\r\nAl in all, it is a quick telling of yet another odd adventure out of many that the Straw Hats part-take in. Pretty generic good pirates save civilians from bad pirate, with the re-occurring trope of the little kid who starts off as dispising said pirates and ends up rooting for the Straw Hats by the end of it.\n"
