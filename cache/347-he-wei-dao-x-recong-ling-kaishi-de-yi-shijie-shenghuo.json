While not the best Anime-collab ad I've seen, this one seems to be on the strong side. It features a good product and one that you could see Subaru actually discussing.\n\r\nThe art and minimal animation were decent, I'd say better than it had the right to be. The skits also worked, even better than those dumb Picture Dramas. I would have taken extra episodes, weird to admit.\n\r\nI was yearning for Ram to say my favorite Barusu word, but man,I was left on edge.\n"
