    "content": "\n                I'm glad I took a break after watching this show before reviewing it because a show in the same in (which is extremely rare) does things to you, I did not want my review to be biased to a certain degree.\n\r\nIt's rather a clich\u00e9 commonly stated in your everyday GTO reviews, \u201cThis fictional character taught me more in life than any IRL person\u201d, \u201cThis class felt more like friends than people IRL\u201d, etc... It would be a lie to disregard that, but not entirely. This show has a way with the audience, and that's saying it lightly.\n\r\nWhat's a better start than the man himself, Onizuka,a man larger than life, and manlier than grunts, it may have been weird to watch the main character younger in age than me for instance, but that is easily overshadowed by how dramatic and impactful his character is to everything else in the show. He is a character that makes it hard to let go when it's time to move on, \u201cbut you can always rewatch\u201d one might say, true, but the experience of getting to know this man from ground zero is something of a privilege and prestige, it's like being a phantom member of the main classroom and getting to warm up to this delinquent of a loser with time, and what a time it was.\n\r\nSpeaking about the class, it's easily one of the best large gatherings of characters in Anime, everyone has time to shine, they have involvement with progressing their arcs rather than just standing there and delivering baseless lines of dialogue. And the setting to has a big charm on everything else, I don't know about you, but late 90s Japan is just a whole vibe.\n\r\nThe overarching plot feels like a hybrid of an American sitcom and a pre-outlined story yet it flows very transparently and with no hagglings.\r\nLet's not forget how magical and nostalgic the soundtrack is, it almost creeps in when you least expect it and completely transforms the mood of the episodes, from a comedy set up to a whole sobbing section with relatable backstories that are closer to real-world problems than anything else.\n\r\nMy only grip if I had any would have been the quality of the animation, it is without a doubt dated, but by no metric bad, just a bit noisy and fogged.\r\nOnizuka sensei might have been an over-the-top character, but he sure left a mark, and so did this show, it was rightfully named. Great Teacher Onizuka.\n\r\nOverall: 8.8/10\n"
