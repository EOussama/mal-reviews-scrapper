    "content": "\n                91 Days Special, a lot of people see it as the eligible 13th episode of the parent series, and I see why. This one was probably one of the best specials a series can have, it gave a lot of information that we were lacking and enforced a lot of plot points, and also, made it a lot harder on us to accept the story's closure.\n\r\n- Story (8.0/10):\r\nThis special gave us more than we could have ever asked for, and no, it was not a definitive conclusion of the story, more like a backing up.\r\nIt tells the story of the formation of the Vanetti family,the meet up of Genzo, Vince, and Raise, some background about Nero and his siblings as kids, their , and everything, while also keeping an eye on some unincluded scenes from the current story's timeline, providing more bromance between Nero and Angelo. It was all beautiful and heartwarming.\n\r\n- Art (8.8/10):\r\nI have to say that this special was somehow better than the parent series in term of animation, I don't know but it felt much more shape and with more quality, the colors where more vibrant as most of the events happened in areas clouded with vegetation in a countryside setting.\n\r\n- Sound (7.2/10):\r\nToo bad there wasn't a DUB version for this one, it would have been far better had it have one. The SUB isn't the worse but the DUB suited this better in my opinion. I'm glad the opening and ending theme songs were kept as amazing as they were.\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\r\nThis special focused more on the elderly, we had more background about Raise, Genzo, and Vincent, Orco as well, we got to see what kind of men they were, what their relationships were, it made more sense of what they did later on, and even more devastating.\n\r\n- Enjoyment (8.6/10):\r\nI didn't think I would enjoy 91 Days Special to this degree, this was a damn fine special episode than rose up and gave more meaning to the main franchise.\n\r\n- Overall (8.1/10):\r\nI would really recommend this pick, mainly of its focus on the characters, giving them extra development and dissecting them for the better. Please only watch this after you finish the parent series for what it holds of potential spoilers.\n"
