What's great about these bloopers is that they could easily work in the grand scheme of the story without hurting the plot, basically, call them alternatives rather than bloopers.\r\nThe jokes are subtle, and never acted out of character as they are built on top of the personality of the characters that deliver them. Too bad there is little content of this type, a bloopers episode for each episode of the parent show would have been awesome, there are so many missing opportunities here.\n              "
