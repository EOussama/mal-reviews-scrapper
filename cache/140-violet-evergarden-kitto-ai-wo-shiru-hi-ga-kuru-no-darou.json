You can say it's pretty repetitive looking at how the whole story is directed, but you can't blame anybody for this as it only serves the plot progression the way it was set up to be.\n\r\nThe pacing was very good, better than most of the episode from the parent series, but again, the backstory was all the same. One woman lost a loved one and wants to express her feelings on a paper, witch on the greater picture, it works as a really well-written mini-arc, but something \u201cnew\u201d would have been appreciated.\n\n\r\nArt (9.5/10):\r\nWe can clearly see they kept up the same consistency when it came to the visual side of the final product. I gave the parent series a solid 10/10 considering the visuals, but this one doesn't really apt to the same level, mainly due to the lack for beautiful still shots of those sunset backgrounds that we've come to love about the original, and not to say that there were none, but you'd figure that they would at least give us an overdose of that imagery.\n\r\nThe OVA is still clearer than most other OVAs where they tend to lower down the production value, and that's definitely a plus.\n\n\r\nSound (9/10):\r\nI guess that the same thing can be said about the vocals, opening and ending theme songs, soundtracks, voice acting, you name it, anything that's hear-able doesn't leave any excuses for any complaint.\r\nMore than anything, there was an opera audition at the end, where they really went with full force on our fragile ears, the song was really good, the lyrics were solid and the attached emotions only made it stronger.\n\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\r\nSo sad to be let down on this one. The episode mainly focuses on this suffering famous performer that again, falls under the same repetitive platera of having lost her boyfriend to war, as we were supposed to connect with her, it felt like she never felt approachable in any way, I know I didn't relate and thus I feel as though she fell short on delivering the same development as the characters of the parent series, although, those as well have had some pretty underdevelopment in their respective contexts. It was those little things, like seeing Erica blush while staring at Benedict, man it was a shame we never got more of that.\n\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\r\nNot what I'd call a re-watch material, but I could probably get some people into Violet Evergardenby simply recommending this standalone OVA. It doesn't spoil much and it serves as a pretty decent preview on what the series is about. I really like the song at the end of the OVA more than anything else in this mini-story, I like the main characters interactions, it seems what the parent series lacked the most concerning them was present here.\n\n\r\nOverall (7.7/10):\r\nYou could definitely skip this without sacrificing anything that can affect your \u201cexperience\u201d with the parent series, it was good on the greater picture unless you start nitpicking every single slip up there is.\n"
