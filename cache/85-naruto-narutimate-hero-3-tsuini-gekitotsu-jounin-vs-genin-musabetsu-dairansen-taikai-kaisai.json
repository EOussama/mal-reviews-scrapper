It's a lengthy commercial your favorite show, yay! No, not really. Konoha is holding a global event for every Ninja to participate in, every individual is given a crystal neckless, and tasked with keeping it intact and take over the others' in hope of staying in the competition that's rewarding as a prize to make any wish they won't come true. Naruto and Sasuke, of course, start getting competitive and all, and set Kakashi as their target, hence the \u201cJonin\u201d in NarutoNarutimate Hero 3: Tsuini Gekitotsu! Jounin vs. Genin!! Musabetsu Dairansen taikai Kaisai!!.\r\nI haven't seen Naruto in a long time, but, from this, it's safe to assume that its way over the usual budget. The animation was fluid, colorful pallet and amazing particle effects.\r\nI was one to experience part one Naruto in DUB, I had no prior knowledge on what the SUB sounded like, however, I was welcomed with generous open arms, the voice acting was just as high in quality if not better.\r\nI had quite a happy time seeing all of those young characters before the demi-Gods era of late Naruto Shippuden and Boruto but still cringed very hard at every desperate attempt of throwing dull jokes, never change Naruto, never change.\n"
