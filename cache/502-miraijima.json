This collaboration between the talented Mori Calliope and the iconic One Piece series is a masterstroke that not only complements the spirit of the beloved manga but also stands out as a remarkable piece of art in its own right.\n\r\nThe synergy between Calliope's dynamic vocal range and the adventurous start of the Egghead arc creates a captivating auditory experience. The song's catchy and energetic rhythm perfectly echoes the mystery that takes place early on in the arc. It's a tune that stays with you, compelling you to hit the replaybutton just one more time.\n\r\nMoreover, the quality of the production is top-notch. The animation is fluid and vibrant, matching the high standards set by the One Piece series. Every frame is a visual treat, teeming with details that fans of the series will appreciate and adore.\n"
