Vivy, the first autonomous AI, is sent back in time by a mysterious teddy bear named Matsumoto to stop a war between humans and AI that will destroy the world. Along the way, she meets various other AI who have their own dreams and missions, and she learns what it means to sing from the heart.\n\r\nThe series is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning animation, gorgeous visuals, and amazing music. The attention to detail is incredible,like how the AI skin wrinkles when they move or express emotions. The songs are catchy and beautiful, and they fit the mood and theme of each arc perfectly. The OST is also superb, with a mix of orchestral, electronic, and vocal tracks that enhance the atmosphere and tension of the scenes.\n\r\nThe action is the best part of the series, with fluid and dynamic fight sequences that showcase Vivy\u2019s skills and abilities. Vivy is not only a singer but also a fighter who can kick ass and take names. She can punch, shoot, hack, fly, and even use her voice as a weapon. She is the star of the show, and everyone else pales in comparison to her.\n\r\nThe only flaws of the series are the weak antagonists and the abrupt ending. The antagonists are mostly generic and forgettable, with vague motives and plans. They are not very threatening or interesting, and they are easily defeated by Vivy and Matsumoto. The ending is also rushed and unsatisfying, with a lot of loose ends and unanswered questions. The AIs were way too human at times, making it hard to relate to them or their struggles.\n\r\nBut these are minor issues that do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the series. Vivy: Fluorite Eye\u2019s Song is a must-watch for anyone who loves sci-fi, action, music, or cute AI girls. It is a fun and thrilling ride that will make you smile, cry, and sing along with Vivy.\n\r\nOverall:8.3/10.\n"
